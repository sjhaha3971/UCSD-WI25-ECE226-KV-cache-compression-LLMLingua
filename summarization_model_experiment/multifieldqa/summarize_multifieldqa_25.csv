What is the name of the most active fan club?,"Football Club Urartu (, translated Futbolayin Akumb Urartu), commonly known as Urartu, is an Armenian professional football team based in the capital Yerevan that currently plays in the Armenian Premier League. The club won the Armenian Cup three times, in 1992, 2007 and 2016. In 2013–2014, they won the Armenian Premier League for the first time in their history.

In early 2016, the Russia-based Armenian businessman Dzhevan Cheloyants became a co-owner of the club after purchasing the major part of the club shares. The club was known as FC Banants until 1 August 2019, when it was officially renamed FC Urartu.

History

Kotayk
Urartu FC were founded as FC Banants by Sarkis Israelyan on 21 January 1992 in the village of Kotayk, representing the Kotayk Province. He named the club after his native village of Banants (currently known as Bayan). Between 1992 and 1995, the club was commonly referred to as Banants Kotayk. During the 1992 season, the club won the first Armenian Cup. At the end of the 1995 transitional season, Banants suffered a financial crisis. The club owners decided that it was better to merge the club with FC Kotayk of Abovyan, rather than disband it. In 2001, Banants demerged from FC Kotayk, and was moved from Abovyan to the capital Yerevan.

Yerevan

FC Banants was relocated to Yerevan in 2001. At the beginning of 2003, Banants merged with FC Spartak Yerevan, but was able to limit the name of the new merger to FC Banants. Spartak became Banants's youth academy and later changed the name to Banants-2. Because of the merger, Banants acquired many players from Spartak Yerevan, including Samvel Melkonyan. After the merger, Banants took a more serious approach and have finished highly in the league table ever since. The club managed to lift the Armenian Cup in 2007.
Experience is making way for youth for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. The departures of most of the experienced players have left the club's future to the youth. Along with two Ukrainian players, Ugandan international, Noah Kasule, has been signed.

The club headquarters are located on Jivani Street 2 of the Malatia-Sebastia District, Yerevan.

Stadium

The construction of the Banants Stadium was launched in 2006 in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, with the assistance of the FIFA goal programme. It was officially opened in 2008 with a capacity of 3,600 seats. Further developments were implemented later in 2011, when the playing pitch was modernized and the capacity of the stadium was increased up to 4,860 seats (2,760 at the northern stand, 1,500 at the southern stand and 600 at the western stand).

Training centre/academy
Banants Training Centre is the club's academy base located in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan. In addition to the main stadium, the centre houses 3 full-size training pitches, mini football pitches as well as an indoor facility. The current technical director of the academy is the former Russian footballer Ilshat Faizulin.

Fans
The most active group of fans is the South West Ultras fan club, mainly composed of residents from several neighbourhoods within the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, since the club is a de facto representer of the district. Members of the fan club benefit from events organized by the club and many facilities of the Banants training centre, such as the mini football pitch, the club store and other entertainments.

Is the ISR necessary for transgene reactivation?,"Current address: Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.
In a variety of species, reduced food intake, and in particular protein or amino acid (AA) restriction, extends lifespan and healthspan. However, the underlying epigenetic and/or transcriptional mechanisms are largely unknown, and dissection of specific pathways in cultured cells may contribute to filling this gap. We have previously shown that, in mammalian cells, deprivation of essential AAs (methionine/cysteine or tyrosine) leads to the transcriptional reactivation of integrated silenced transgenes, including plasmid and retroviral vectors and latent HIV-1 provirus, by a process involving epigenetic chromatic remodeling and histone acetylation. Here we show that the deprivation of methionine/cysteine also leads to the transcriptional upregulation of endogenous retroviruses, suggesting that essential AA starvation affects the expression not only of exogenous non-native DNA sequences, but also of endogenous anciently-integrated and silenced parasitic elements of the genome. Moreover, we show that the transgene reactivation response is highly conserved in different mammalian cell types, and it is reproducible with deprivation of most essential AAs. The General Control Non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase and the downstream integrated stress response represent the best candidates mediating this process; however, by pharmacological approaches, RNA interference and genomic editing, we demonstrate that they are not implicated. Instead, the response requires MEK/ERK and/or JNK activity and is reproduced by ribosomal inhibitors, suggesting that it is triggered by a novel nutrient-sensing and signaling pathway, initiated by translational block at the ribosome, and independent of mTOR and GCN2. Overall, these findings point to a general transcriptional response to essential AA deprivation, which affects the expression of non-native genomic sequences, with relevant implications for the epigenetic/transcriptional effects of AA restriction in health and disease.

In animals, excessive, insufficient, or imbalanced nutrient availability is known to strongly impact on phenotype and health, both short and long-term, and across generations [1, 2]. In particular, studies in yeast, animal models and humans have shown that reduced food intake, reducing either overall calories, or only sugars, proteins, or even single amino acids (AA), such as Methionine (Met), may extend lifespan and healthspan, and reduce the risk of cancer and other age-related diseases [3–9]. In addition, fasting or specific AA deprivation have shown potential therapeutic applications, owing to their ability to directly reduce the growth of some tumor types [10, 11], sensitize cancer cells to chemo- or immunotherapy [12, 13], and allow efficient hematopoietic stem cell engraftment . However, little is known about the specific processes and molecular mechanisms mediating the roles of nutrient restriction in human health and longevity.
A properly balanced diet in metazoans contains optimal amounts of a subset of AA, which cannot be synthetized de novo and are therefore named essential amino acids (EAAs). In humans these include Met, Histidine (His), Isoleucine (Ile), Leucine (Leu), Lysine (Lys), Phenylalanine (Phe), Threonine (Thr), Tryptophan (Trp), and Valine (Val), while a few others are considered as semi-essential, such as Glutamine (Gln) and Tyrosine (Tyr) [15, 16]. Consistently, EAA deprivation triggers a cell-autonomous adaptive response, characterized by extensive metabolic and gene expression modifications, implementing biosynthetic, catabolic, and plasma membrane transport processes, aimed at reconstituting the full AA complement [17, 18]. The best known and conserved pathways responding to AA deprivation are triggered by mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) and General amino acid Control Non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) protein kinases [15, 19, 20]. Activation of mTORC1 requires in particular the presence of Gln, Arg and Leu, but also Met , which activate the kinase through sensors mainly acting upstream of Rag GTPases at lysosomal membranes . In turn, mTORC1 promotes cell growth, proliferation and anabolism upon activation, and translational attenuation and autophagy upon inhibition [19, 20].
By contrast, GCN2 is activated by deprivation of any individual EAA, by means of its histidyl-tRNA synthetase-related domain, which binds uncharged tRNAs accumulating during AA limitation [23, 24]. Upon activation, GCN2 phosphorylates and inhibits its only known downstream target, namely the eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 α (eIF2α), thereby initiating the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). This leads to attenuation of general translation, and induction of a transcriptional/translational program, aimed at increasing stress resistance and restoring cell homeostasis, by upregulating a specific subset of genes, including Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP-Homologous Protein (CHOP) [25–27]. Thus, inhibition of mTORC1 and activation of GCN2 by AA restriction cooperate to attenuate general translation at the initiation step, increase catabolism and turnover, and enhance stress resistance to promote adaptation . However, how these processes eventually induce protective mechanisms against the alterations associated with aging, which include pervasive epigenetic and transcriptional changes [28, 29], remains largely unknown.
We previously reported the unexpected observation that prolonged deprivation of either Tyr, or of both Methionine and Cysteine (Met/Cys), triggers the selective and reversible reactivation of exogenous transcriptional units, including plasmids, retroviral vectors and proviruses, integrated into the genome and transcriptionally repressed by defensive mechanisms against non-native DNA sequences [30, 31]. This phenomenon was observed both in HeLa epithelial and ACH-2 lymphocytic human cells, and was independent of the transgene or provirus (Ocular Albinism type 1, OA1; Green Fluorescent Protein, GFP; Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1, LAMP1; Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1, HIV-1), or of the exogenous promoter driving their transcription, either viral (cytomegalovirus, CMV; Long Terminal Repeat, LTR) or human (Phospho-Glycerate Kinase 1, PGK1; Elongation Factor-1α, EF-1α) . Furthermore, this transgene reactivation response was not reproduced by serum starvation, activation of p38, or pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR (PP242 or rapamycin), sirtuins and DNA methylation. By contrast, it was induced by pan histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and by selective inhibitors of class II HDACs . Consistently, we found that the mechanism responsible involves epigenetic modifications at the transgene promoter, including reduced nucleosome occupancy and increased histone acetylation, and is mediated in part by reduced expression of a class II HDAC, namely HDAC4 .
These findings indicate that AA deprivation induces a specific epigenetic and transcriptional response, affecting the expression of newly-integrated exogenous transgenes and proviruses, and suggesting that endogenous sequences sharing similar structural and functional features may represent a transcriptional target as well [30, 31]. In particular, transposable elements, such as LTR-retrotransposons (or endogenous retroviruses, ERVs), are genomic “parasites” anciently-integrated into the genome, and silenced by epigenetic mechanisms of mammalian cells against the spreading of mobile elements, eventually becoming ""endogenized"" during evolution [32, 33]. This raises the question of whether their expression is also sensitive to AA restriction. In addition, it remains unclear whether or not the transgene reactivation response is related to specific AA deprivations, and most importantly which is the AA sensing/signaling pathway involved, in particular whether the GCN2 kinase is implicated. Thus, here we used the reactivation of silenced transgenes in cultured cells, as a model to investigate a novel molecular pathway induced by imbalanced EAA starvation, implicated in the epigenetic/transcriptional regulation of exogenous non-native DNA sequences and possibly of other endogenous anciently-integrated genomic elements.
HeLa human epithelial carcinoma, HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma and C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells were maintained in DMEM containing glutaMAX (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin G (Invitrogen), 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cell lines carrying integrated and partially silenced transgenes were also maintained in 600–1000 μg/ml G418.
The C2C12 cell line was provided by ATCC. HeLa and HepG2 cells were obtained by Drs. F. Blasi and G. Tonon at San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, respectively, and were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) profiling, using the Cell ID System kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, STR-based multiplex PCR was carried out in a final volume of 25 μL/reaction, including 5 μL Cell ID Enzyme Mix 5X, 2.5 μL Cell ID Primer Mix 10X and 3 ng of template DNA. The thermal cycling conditions were: 1 cycle at 96°C for 2 min, followed by 32 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 62°C for 90 sec, and 72°C for 90 sec, and 1 cycle at 60°C for 45 sec. The following STR loci were amplified: AMEL, CSF1PO, D13S317, D16S539, D21S11, D5S818, D7S820, TH01, TPOX, vWA. Fragment length analysis of STR-PCR products was performed by Eurofins Genomics, using standard procedures of capillary electrophoresis on the Applied Biosystems 3130 XL sequencing machine, and assessment of the STR profile was performed at the online STR matching analysis service provided at http://www.dsmz.de/fp/cgi-bin/str.html.
Stable cell clones, expressing myc-tagged human OA1 (GPR143) or GFP transcripts, were generated using pcDNA3.1/OA1myc-His or pcDNA3.1/EGFP vectors . Briefly, HeLa, HepG2 and C2C12 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche) and selected with 800, 1000, and 650 μg/ml of G418 (Sigma), respectively, which was maintained thereafter to avoid loss of plasmid integration. G418-resistant clones were isolated and analyzed for protein expression by epifluorescence and/or immunoblotting.
Full DMEM-based medium, carrying the entire AA complement, and media deprived of Met/Cys (both AAs), Met (only), Cys (only), Alanine (Ala), Thr, Gln, Val, Leu, Tyr, Trp, Lys and His were prepared using the Nutrition free DMEM (cat.#09077–05, from Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan), by adding Glucose, NaHCO3, and either all 20 AAs (for full medium) or 18–19 AAs only (for deprivations of two-one AAs). Single AAs, Glucose, and NaHCO3 were from Sigma. Further details and amounts utilized are indicated in S1 Table. All media were supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin G (Invitrogen), 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and G418 as required. HBSS was from Invitrogen. Cells were seeded at 10–30% of confluency; cells to be starved for 48 h were plated 2–3 times more confluent compared to the control. The following day, cells were washed and cultured in the appropriate medium, with or without EAA, for 24–48 h.
L-Histidinol (HisOH), PP242, Integrated Stress Response Inhibitor (ISRIB), SP600125, Cycloheximide (CHX) were from Sigma; Salubrinal was from Tocris Bioscience; U0126 was from Promega. Drugs were used at the following final concentrations: HisOH at 4–16 mM; PP242 at 1–3 μM; ISRIB at 100 nM; SP600125 at 20 μM in HepG2 cells and 50 μM in HeLa cells; Cycloheximide (CHX) at 50 ug/ml in HepG2 cells and 100 ug/ml in HeLa cells; Salubrinal at 75 μM; U0126 at 50 μM. Vehicle was used as mock control. Treatments with drugs to be tested for their ability to inhibit transgene reactivation (ISRIB, SP600125 and U0126) were initiated 1h before the subsequent addition of L-Histidinol (ISRIB) or the subsequent depletion of Met/Cys (SP600125 and U0126).
Total RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was determined by Nanodrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Equal amount (1 μg) of RNA from HeLa, HepG2 and C2C12 cells was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) using oligo-dT as primers, and diluted to 5 ng/μl. The cDNA (2 μl) was amplified by real-time PCR using SYBR green Master Mix on a Light Cycler 480 (Roche), according to manufacturer’s instructions. The thermal cycling conditions were: 1 cycle at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40–45 cycles at 95° for 20 sec, 56° for 20 sec and 72° for 20 sec. The sequences, efficiencies and annealing temperatures of the primers are provided in S2 Table. Data were analyzed with Microsoft Excel using the formula EtargetΔct target (control-sample) /EreferenceΔct reference (control-sample) . Reference genes for normalizations were ARPC2 (actin-related protein 2/3 complex, subunit 2) for HeLa and HepG2 cells; and Actb (actin beta) for C2C12 cells, unless otherwise indicated.
siRNA (Mission esiRNA, 200 ng/μL; Sigma) against ATF4 and GCN2 were designed against the targeted sequences NM_001675 and NM_001013703, respectively. Cells seeded in 6-well plates were transfected with 1 μg of siRNAs and 5 μL of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following manufacturer’s instructions, at day 1 post-plating for ATF4 and at day 1 and 2 post-plating for GCN2. At day 2 (ATF4) or 3 (GCN2) post-plating, cells were washed and cultured in medium in the absence or presence of HisOH 4 mM for 6 h. siRNAs against RLuc (Sigma), targeting Renilla Luciferase, were used as negative control. For CRISPR/Cas9 experiments, we used the “all-in-one Cas9-reporter” vector, expressing GFP (Sigma), which is characterized by a single vector format including the Cas9 protein expression cassette and gRNA (guide RNA). GFP is co-expressed from the same mRNA as the Cas9 protein, enabling tracking of transfection efficiency and enrichment of transfected cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The human U6 promoter drives gRNA expression, and the CMV promoter drives Cas9 and GFP expression. The oligonucleotide sequences for the three gRNAs targeting GCN2 exon 1 or 6 are listed in S2 Table. We transfected HeLa and HepG2 cells with these plasmids individually (one plasmid one guide) and sorted the GFP-positive, transfected cells by FACS. Screening GCN2-KO clones was performed by western blotting. In the case of HepG2-OA1 cells, two rounds of selection were necessary to obtain three GCN2-KO clones by using a guide RNA against exon 1. Compared to the original HepG2-OA1 cell line and to the clone resulting from the first round of selection (185#27), the selected clones E23, F22 and F27 showed a very low amount—if any—of residual GCN2 protein (see results).
Genomic DNA of HeLa and HepG2 cells was purified using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration was determined by Nanodrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). PCR conditions for amplification of GCN2 exon 1 and 6 were as follows: 1 cycle at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 40 sec, 56°C for 40 sec, and 72°C for 40 sec; and a final extension step of 5 min at 72°C. The primer sequences are provided in S2 Table.
For OA1, western immunoblotting was carried out as described . For GCN2, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, boiled at 95°C for 5 min and resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel; immunoblotting was then performed following standard procedures. Primary Abs were as follows: anti-human OA1, previously developed by our group in rabbits ; anti-GCN2 (Cell Signaling, Cat. #3302).
Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel for Mac (version 15.32, Microsoft) for Student’s t-test; or GraphPad Prism (version 5.0d for Mac, GraphPad Software, Inc.) for one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnett’s or Tukey’s multiple comparisons post-tests. T-test was used when only two means, typically sample versus control, were compared, as specified in the figure legends. One way ANOVA was used for multiple comparisons, followed by either a Dunnett’s (to compare every mean to a control mean), or a Tukey’s (to compare every mean with every other mean) post-test, by setting the significance level at 0.05 (95% confidence intervals). Both tests compare the difference between means to the amount of scatter, quantified using information from all the groups. Specifically, Prism computes the Tukey-Kramer test, allowing unequal sample sizes. P values in Figures are generally referred to comparison between a sample and the control (full medium/mock), and are indicated as follows: *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. Comparisons not involving the control are similarly indicated, by a horizontal line at the top of the graphs, encompassing the two samples under analysis. Additional details regarding the specific experiments are reported in the Figure Legends.
To examine the expression behavior of genomic repeats upon AA starvation, we performed a transcriptomic analysis taking advantage of an intramural sequencing facility. HeLa-OA1 cells were cultured in normal medium (for 6-30-120 hours) or in absence of Met/Cys (for 6-15-30-72-120 hours). Total RNA was prepared using Trizol (Sigma) to preserve transcripts of both small and long sizes (from Alu, of about 0.3 kb, to Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements, LINEs, and ERVs, up to 6–8 kb long), DNase treated to avoid contamination of genomic DNA, and processed for NGS sequencing by Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 protocol and HiSeq 2000 apparatus. Raw sequence data (10–20 M reads/sample) were aligned to the human genome (build hg19) with SOAPSplice . Read counts over repeated regions, defined by RepeatMasker track from UCSC genome browser , were obtained using bedtools suite . Normalization factors and read dispersion (d) were estimated with edgeR , variation of abundance during time was analyzed using maSigPro package , fitting with a negative binomial distribution (Θ = 1/d, Q = 0.01), with a cutoff on stepwise regression fit r2 = 0.7. Read counts were transformed to RPKM for visualization purposes. The expression of the OA1 transgene and HDAC4, which are progressively up- and down-regulated during starvation, respectively , were used as internal controls.
For genomic repeat analysis, reads belonging to repetitive elements were classified according to RepeatMasker and assigned to repeat classes (total number in the genome = 21), families (total number in the genome = 56) and finally subfamilies (total number in the genome = 1396), each including a variable number of genomic loci (from a few hundred for endogenous retroviruses, up to several thousand for Alu). Repeat subfamilies were then clustered according to their expression pattern in starved vs control cells, by maSigPro using default parameters, and repeats classes or families that are significantly enriched in each cluster, compared to all genomic repeats, were identified by applying a Fisher Exact test (using scipy.stats, a statistical module of Python). Alternatively, differentially expressed repeat subfamilies were identified by averaging three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls. Repeats significantly up- or downregulated (104 and 77, respectively) were selected based on a P value <0.05 (unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, assuming equal variance), and analyzed for their class enrichment by a Fisher Exact test as described above.
For gene set enrichment analysis of Met/Cys deprived vs control HeLa cells, differentially expressed genes were selected considering three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls, based on a P value <0.05 (unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, assuming equal variance) and a fold change >2. This led to a total of 2033 differentially expressed genes, 996 upregulated and 1037 downregulated. The enrichment analysis was performed separately for up and down regulated genes, or with all differentially expressed genes together (both), using the KEGG database. The analysis was performed with correction for the background of all expressed genes (about 13600 genes showing an average expression over 3 starvation and 3 control samples of at least 5 counts) and by using default parameters (adjusted P value and q-value cut-off of <0.05 and 0.2, respectively). Differentially expressed genes were also selected considering all starvation time points, as with genomic repeats, by maSigPro using default parameters, and a fold change of at least 1.5, leading to similar enrichment results (not shown). RNAseq gene expression data are available in the ArrayExpress database under the accession number E-MTAB-6452.
To provide proof-of-principle that AA starvation may affect the expression of transposable elements, we performed an RNAseq analysis of the previously described HeLa-OA1 cells, carrying an integrated and partially silenced OA1 transgene . Since the reactivation of the transgene by starvation is a progressive phenomenon , we performed a time-course experiment, where each time point represents one biological sample, rather than a biological triplicate of a single time point. To this aim, cells were cultured either in normal medium, or in absence of Met/Cys for different time points (6-15-30-72-120 hours), resulting in the progressive upregulation of the OA1 transgene during starvation (Fig 1A and 1B), consistent with previously published results . The expression of genomic repeats was determined according to RepeatMasker annotation and classification into classes, families, and subfamilies. Repeat species were then subjected to differential expression and enrichment analyses in starved vs control conditions. Out of 1396 annotated repeat subfamilies, 172 species displayed a differential expression profile during starvation.

Data represent RPKM (A), or mean ± SD of 2 technical replicates, expressed as fold change vs. control (full medium at 6 h = 1) (B). (C) Clustering of 172 genomic repeat subfamilies, differentially expressed upon starvation, according to their expression profile. (D) Class distribution of repeat subfamilies belonging to differential expression clusters, compared to all genomic repeat subfamilies (first column). Class DNA includes DNA transposons; SINE includes Alu; LINE includes L1 an L2; LTR includes endogenous retroviruses and solitary LTRs; Satellite includes centromeric acrosomal and telomeric satellites; Others includes SVA, simple repeats, snRNA, and tRNAs. LTR-retroelements are significantly enriched among repeats that are upregulated upon starvation, while LINEs are significantly enriched among repeats that are downregulated. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001 (Fisher exact test).
As shown in Fig 1C, the clustering of differentially expressed repeats, according to their expression pattern, reveals profiles comparable to the behavior of the transgene in the same conditions, i.e. upregulation upon starvation and no change in regular medium (Cluster 1 and 2). In particular, Cluster 1 contains sequences that, similarly to the OA1 transgene, are progressively upregulated upon starvation (Fig 1A and 1C) , while Cluster 2 contains sequences that are upregulated at early time points. Interestingly, repeat families that are significantly enriched in these two clusters belong mostly to the group of LTR-retrotransposons, including ERV1, ERVK, ERVL, ERVL-MaLR and other LTR sequences (Fig 1D; S1A and S2A Figs). By contrast, DNA transposons (such as TcMar-Tigger) and L1 non-LTR retrotransposons are enriched among repeats that are downregulated during starvation, particularly at late time points (Clusters 3 and 4) (Fig 1D; S1A and S2A Figs). Consistent results were obtained by selecting significantly up- or downregulated genomic repeats (overall 181 species), based on their average expression out of three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h, when the transgene upregulation is more homogeneous) and controls, and on a P value <0.05 (S1B and S2B Figs). These findings suggest that EAA starvation induces genome-wide effects involving repetitive elements, and that—among major repeat classes—it upregulates in particular the expression of ERVs.
In addition, to obtain a general overview of main gene pathways changing their expression together with the transgene during AA starvation, we performed gene expression and enrichment analyses of regular genes, by considering three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls. Differentially expressed genes were selected based on a P value <0.05 and a fold change between means of at least 2, and analyzed with the EnrichR tool . As shown in Fig 2 and S1 File, enrichment analyses against the KEGG and Reactome databases reveals a predominance of downregulated pathways, namely ribosome and translation, proteasome, AA metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and other pathways related to mitochondrial functions, which are affected in Huntington, Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html). In particular, a large fraction of ribosomal protein mRNAs is downregulated upon Met/Cys starvation (Fig 2A and 2C; S1 File), consistent with the notion that their genes–despite being scattered throughout the genome—are coordinately expressed in a variety of conditions . This reduced expression may depend on multiple pathways that control ribosome biogenesis in response to external stimuli, including the downregulation of Myc activity , the downregulation of mTORC1 [42, 44], or possibly the activation of the ISR, as described in yeast . By contrast, upregulated genes show a significant enrichment for transcription and gene expression (Fig 2B). Similar results were obtained by the Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO-BP) database (S1 File), overall indicating a general downregulation of translation and metabolism, and upregulation of transcription, during the time interval of Met/Cys starvation corresponding to the transgene upregulation.
Fig 2. Gene set enrichment analysis of Met/Cys-deprived HeLa cells.
Differentially expressed genes between three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls were selected based on a P value <0.05 and a fold change of at least 2, leading to a total of 996 upregulated, and 1037 downregulated genes. The enrichment analysis was performed separately for up and down regulated genes, using the EnrichR tool and the KEGG (A) and REACTOME (B, C) databases. Ranking is based on the combined score provided by EnrichR, and categories are displayed up to 20 items with an Adjusted P value <0.05. No significant categories were found with upregulated genes against the KEGG database. All data are shown in S1 File. The enrichment analysis using all differentially expressed genes together did not reveal any additional enriched process.
To characterize the pathway leading to the reactivation of silenced transgenes, we used HeLa-OA1 and HeLa-GFP cells, as described . In addition, to test cell types relevant for AA metabolism, such as liver and muscle, we generated clones of HepG2 human hepatoma and C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells, stably transfected with plasmids for OA1 and GFP transgenes, respectively (HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells; endogenous OA1 is not expressed in any of these cell types). In all cases, the integrated transgenes are under the control of the CMV promoter in the context of a pcDNA3.1 plasmid, are partially silenced, and can be efficiently upregulated by HDAC inhibitors (trichostatin A, TSA; ref.  and S3A, S3B and S4A Figs), indicating that their expression is controlled at least in part by epigenetic mechanisms, as previously described .
To establish whether the reactivation response results from the shortage of specific AAs only, such as Met/Cys, or it is triggered by any AA deprivations, we cultured HeLa-OA1, HeLa-GFP, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells for 24–48 hours with a battery of media deprived of EAAs or semi-EAAs, including Met/Cys, Thr, Gln, Val, Leu, Tyr, Trp, Lys, and His. As negative controls, cells were cultured in full medium, carrying the entire AA complement, and in a medium deprived of Ala, a non-essential AA. The expression of the transgene transcript was then evaluated by RT-qPCR. As shown in Fig 3, and in S3C and S4B Figs, most EAA-deficiencies induced reactivation of the OA1 or GFP transgenes in all four cell lines, with the notable exception of Trp deprivation, which consistently resulted in no or minimal reactivation of the transgenes. Indeed, despite some variability, Met/Cys deficiency, but also Thr, Val, Tyr, and His deprivation always gave an efficient response, while Leu, Gln and Lys elicited evident responses in some cases, but not in others. Depletion of Phe gave results comparable to Tyr deprivation, however it significantly altered multiple reference genes used for normalization and therefore was eventually omitted from the analysis (not shown). Finally, in the above experiments we used a combined Met/Cys deficiency, to avoid the potential sparing of Met by Cys  and for consistency with our previous studies . Nevertheless, the analysis of single Met or Cys starvation, both at the protein and transcript levels, revealed an exclusive role of Met deprivation in transgene reactivation, consistent with the notion that Cys is not an EAA (S3D and S3E Fig).
Fig 3. EAA deprivation induces reactivation of silent transgenes in HeLa and HepG2 cells.

Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (full medium = 1). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 (one way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s post-test vs. full medium).
Collectively, these results indicate that transgene reactivation by EAA starvation is reproducible with most EAAs, shared by different cell types (epithelium, liver, and skeletal muscle), and conserved in different mammalian species (human, mouse).
mTORC1 inhibition and GCN2 activation trigger the best-known signaling pathways responding to AA starvation . We previously showed that inhibition of mTORC1 is not sufficient to reproduce transgene reactivation in HeLa cells . By contrast, the involvement of GCN2 and the ISR, including the downstream effectors ATF4 and CHOP, has never been tested. In addition, this pathway has been typically assessed in transient assays, lasting for a few hours, which may not be comparable with the prolonged starvation conditions necessary to reactivate the transgene expression (at least 15–24 h). Thus, we tested whether CHOP expression was upregulated upon incubation of HeLa-OA1, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells in media deprived of different EAAs for 24–48 h.
As shown in Fig 3 and S4B Fig, we found that CHOP expression is increased in all EAA-starvation conditions, but not in the absence of Ala, in all tested cell lines. Similar, yet less pronounced, results were obtained with ATF4, consistent with the notion that activation of this transcription factor is mainly mediated by translational upregulation (not shown) [15, 26]. However, the upregulation of CHOP does not parallel quantitatively that of the transgene, neither appears sufficient to induce it. In fact, CHOP is highly upregulated even upon Trp starvation, which consistently results in no or minimal reactivation of the transgenes (compare CHOP with OA1 or GFP expression; Fig 3 and S4B Fig). Thus, while the ISR appears widely activated upon EAA starvation, the upregulation of its downstream effector CHOP only partly correlates with transgene reactivation and may not be sufficient to induce it.
The activation of the ISR upon AA starvation suggests that GCN2 may be involved in the transgene reactivation response. Therefore, we tested whether direct pharmacological activation of this kinase is sufficient to trigger the transgene reactivation similarly to starvation. In addition, we used pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR to corroborate previous negative results in HeLa cells  in the other cell lines under study. To this aim, HeLa-OA1 or GFP, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor) or L-Histidinol (GCN2 activator, inhibiting tRNAHis charging by histidyl-tRNA synthetase), either alone or in combination for 24 h, compared to Met/Cys-deprived and full medium. As shown in Fig 4 and S5 Fig, while inhibition of mTORC1 consistently leads to minor or no effects, in agreement with previous findings , treatment with L-Histidinol results in efficient reactivation of the transgene in HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells, but not in HeLa cells.
Fig 4. mTOR inhibition and GCN2 activation differently affect transgene expression in HeLa and HepG2 cells.
Relative transgene (OA1) and CHOP mRNA abundance in HeLa-OA1 (A) and HepG2-OA1 (B) cells, cultured in Met/Cys-deprived medium, or in the presence of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor; 1–3 μM) or L-Histidinol (HisOH, GCN2 activator; 4–16 mM), either alone or in combination for 24–48 h, compared to full medium. Mean ± SEM of 4 (A) or 3 (B) independent experiments. Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (full medium = 1). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 (one way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s post-test vs. full medium). PP-1 and PP-3, PP242 at 1 and 3 μM, respectively; HisOH-4 and HisOH-16, L-Histidinol at 4 and 16 mM, respectively.
Specifically, L-Histidinol is not effective in HeLa-OA1 and HeLa-GFP cells, either alone or in combination with PP242 (Fig 4A and S5A Fig), or by using different concentrations of the drug, with or without serum (not shown). In these cells, L-Histidinol appears also unable to trigger the ISR, as indicated by lack of CHOP upregulation, possibly due to their different sensitivity to the drug. These findings are consistent with previous reports, describing the use of L-Histidinol in HeLa cells in conditions of low His concentration in the culture medium , which would resemble AA starvation in our system and therefore may not be applicable. Thus, even though the amount of the amino alcohol was adapted to exceed 20 to 80 times that of the amino acid, as described , HeLa cells may be resistant or able to compensate.
In contrast, in other cell types, L-Histidinol has been utilized in regular DMEM, to mimic the AA response triggered by DMEM lacking His [48, 49]. Consistently, in HepG2-OA1 cells, L-Histidinol is sufficient to elicit extremely high levels of transgene reactivation, and its combination with PP242 results in additive or even synergistic effects, possibly due to an indirect effect of mTOR inhibition on GCN2 activity (Fig 4B) [50, 51]. Similarly, C2C12-GFP cells efficiently reactivate the transgene upon treatment with L-Histidinol, but not PP242 (S5B Fig). However, differently from HepG2-OA1 cells, simultaneous treatment of C2C12-GFP cells with L-Histidinol and PP242 does not lead to synergistic effects. Consistent with stimulation of the ISR, CHOP and to a minor extent ATF4 are upregulated by L-Histidinol in both cell lines, yet their expression levels show only an incomplete correlation with those of the transgene (Fig 4B, S5B Fig, and not shown).
The finding that GCN2 activation by L-Histidinol is sufficient to reactivate the transgenes in both HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells pointed to this kinase, and to the downstream ISR, as the pathway possibly involved in the EAA starvation response. Thus, we investigated whether the ISR is sufficient to trigger upregulation of the OA1 transgene in HepG2-OA1 cells by pharmacological means. As CHOP expression does not correspond quantitatively and is not sufficient to induce transgene reactivation, we tested the role of the core upstream event of the ISR, namely the phosphorylation of eIF2α , which can be induced by pharmacological treatments, independent of GCN2 (Fig 5A). To this aim, we used Salubrinal, a specific phosphatase inhibitor that blocks both constitutive and ER stress-induced phosphatase complexes against eIF2α, thereby increasing its phosphorylation . We found that, while the ISR is activated upon Salubrinal treatment, as shown by increased CHOP expression, it does not induce OA1 transgene reactivation (Fig 5B).
Fig 5. The ISR is neither sufficient nor necessary to induce transgene reactivation in HepG2 cells.

Mean ± range of two experiments. Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (DMEM = 1). **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 (one way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post-test; P values refer to comparisons vs. control, unless otherwise indicated). (D) Relative transgene (OA1) and ATF4 mRNA abundance in HepG2-OA1 cells transfected with control (CTRL) or anti-ATF4 siRNAs, and incubated in the presence or absence of L-Histidinol (HisOH, GCN2 activator; 4 mM) for 6 h. Mean ± range of two experiments. Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (w/o HisOH = 1, top; control siRNA = 1, bottom). *P<0.05 (one way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post-test; P values refer to comparisons vs. control, unless otherwise indicated).
To test whether the ISR is necessary to trigger the transgene response to L-Histidinol, we used the chemical compound ISRIB, which inhibits the activation of the ISR, even in the presence of phosphorylated eIF2α, likely by boosting the activity of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for eIF2α, namely eIF2B [53, 54]. HepG2-OA1 cells were stimulated with L-Histidinol, either in the presence or absence of ISRIB. As shown in Fig 5C, while the expression of CHOP is inhibited by ISRIB, as expected, the reactivation of the OA1 transgene is not affected. In addition, knockdown of the closest eIF2α downstream effector ATF4 by siRNAs does not interfere with the reactivation of the OA1 transgene by L-Histidinol (Fig 5D). Together, these data suggest that eIF2α phosphorylation and the downstream ISR pathway are neither sufficient nor necessary to induce transgene reactivation.
To definitively establish if GCN2 is necessary to trigger the transgene reactivation response to EAA starvation, we directly suppressed its expression by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-out (KO). We generated three independent GCN2-KO clones from the parental HeLa-OA1 cell line, by using three different guide RNAs, two against exon 1 (clones 183#11 and 185#5), and one against exon 6 (clone 239#1) of the GCN2 gene. Genomic characterization confirmed the presence of mutations on both alleles of exon 1 of the GCN2 gene in clone 183#11, and on both alleles of exon 6 in clone 239#1; by contrast, clone 185#5 showed multiple alleles in exon 1, consistent with the presence of two cell populations, and was not characterized further at the genomic level (S6 Fig). None of these clones express GCN2 at the protein level, as shown by immunoblotting (Fig 6A). To test the GCN2-KO cells for their ability to respond to EAA starvation, parental HeLa-OA1 cells and the three GCN2-KO clones were cultured in media deprived of Met/Cys or Thr (corresponding to the most effective treatments in this cell line; see Fig 3A) for 24–48 h and transgene expression was assessed by RT-qPCR. We found that the reactivation of the OA1 transgene is neither abolished, nor reduced by KO of GCN2, thus excluding that this kinase is necessary for the response to EAA starvation in HeLa-OA1 cells (Fig 6B and 6C).

Mean ± SD of 3 technical replicates from 1 experiment. Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (full medium = 1). Since independent clones may display variable reactivation responses (e.g. due to different levels of transgene expression in basal conditions), the results are not shown as means of the three clones, but as separate replicates.
Similarly, we generated GCN2-KO clones from the parental HepG2-OA1 cell line by the same strategy. By using a guide RNA against exon 1 of the GCN2 gene, we obtained three independent GCN2-KO clones, namely E23, F22 and F27. Genomic characterization confirmed the presence of mutations on both alleles of exon 1 of the GCN2 gene in clone F27 (S7 Fig) and all three clones showed a very low amount—if any—of residual GCN2 protein, compared to the original HepG2-OA1 cell line (Fig 7A). To assess the ability of GCN2-KO cells to reactivate the transgene upon starvation, we cultured parental HepG2-OA1 cells and the three GCN2-KO clones in media deprived of Met/Cys or His (corresponding to the most effective treatments in this cell line; see Fig 3B) for 24 h, and evaluated the transgene expression by RT-qPCR. As shown in Fig 7B and 7C, we found that the reactivation of the OA1 transgene is neither abolished, nor reduced by KO of GCN2, as in HeLa cells. To further confirm this result, we knocked-down GCN2 by RNA interference (RNAi), and incubated the cells with or without L-Histidinol for 6 h. As shown in Fig 8, treatment of HepG2-OA1 cells with L-Histidinol results in efficient transgene reactivation, even upon significant GCN2 downregulation, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Taken together, these data strongly support the conclusion that GCN2 is not necessary for transgene reactivation in response to EAA starvation, either in HeLa or in HepG2 cells.

However, the underlying epigenetic and/or transcriptional mechanisms are largely unknown, and dissection of specific pathways in cultured cells may contribute to filling this gap. We show that the deprivation of methionine/cysteine also leads to the transcriptional upregulation of endogenous retroviruses, suggesting that essential AA starvation affects the expression not only of exogenous non-native DNA sequences, but also of. anciently-integrated and silenced parasitic elements of the genome. Overall, these findings point to a general transcriptional response to essential AA deprivation, which affects the. expression of non- native genomic sequences, with relevant implications for the. epigenetic/transcriptional effects of AA restriction in health and disease. The authors declare that no competing interests exist and that the commercial affiliation of one of the authors does not alter the adherence of authors to all PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. ability is known to strongly impact on phenotype and health, both short and long-term, and across generations. Little is known about the specific processes and molecular mechanisms mediating the roles of nutrient restriction in human health and longevity. The best known and conserved pathways responding to AA deprivation are triggered by mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) and General amino acid Control Non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) protein kinases. We previously reported the unexpected observation that prolonged deprivation of either Tyr, or of both Methionine and Cysteine (Met/Cys), triggers the selective and reversible reactivation of exogenous transcriptional units, including plasmids, retroviral vectors and proviruses. This phenomenon was observed both in HeLa epithelial and ACH-2 lymphtic human cells. It was independent of the transgene or provirus (OA type 1, OA Fluorescent Protein, and OA fluorescent Protein 1, LAMP) that was integrated into the genome and transcriptionally repressed by defensive mechanisms against non-native DNA sequences. This transgene reactivation response was not reproduced by serum starvation, activation of p38, or pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR (PP242 or rapamycin), sirtuins and DNA methylation. By contrast, it was induced by pan histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and by selective inhibitors of class II HDACs. We found that the mechanism responsible involves epigenetic modifications at the transGene promoter, including reduced nucleosome occupancy and increased histone acetylation. These findings indicate that AA deprivation induces a specific epigenetic and transcriptional response, affecting the expression of newly-integrated exogenous transgenes and proviruses. This suggests that endogenous sequences sharing similar structural and functional features may represent a transcriptional target as well [30, 31]. In particular, transposable elements, such as LTR-retrotransposons (or endogenous retroviruses, ERVs), are genomic “parasites” anciently-integration into the genome, and silenced by epigenetic mechanisms of mammalian cells against the spreading of mobile elements, eventually becoming ""endogenized"" during evolution. This raises the question of whether their expression is also sensitive to AA restriction. Full DMEM-based medium, carrying the entire AA complement, was used. Media deprived of Met/Cys (both AAs), Met (only), Cys ( only), Alanine (Ala), Thr, Gln, Val, Leu, Tyr, Trp, Lys and His were prepared using the Nutrition free DMEM (cat.#09077–05, from Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) All media were supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and G418 as required. Cells were seeded at 10–30% of confluency; cells to be starved for 48 h were plated 2–3 times more confluent compared to the control. Treatments with drugs to be tested for their ability to inhibit transgene reactivation (ISRIB, SP600125 and U0126) were initiated 1h before the subsequent addition of L-Histidinol. RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was determined by Nanodrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) Equal amount of RNA from HeLa, HepG2 and C2C12 cells was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR. Genomic DNA of HeLa and HepG2 cells was purified using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primer sequences for the three gRNAs targeting GCN2 exon 1 or 6 are listed in S2 Table. U6 promoter drives gRNA expression, and the CMV promoter drives Cas9 and GFP expression. Primary Abs were as follows: anti-human OA1, previously developed by our group in rabbits ; anti-GCN2 (Cell Signaling, Cat. #3302). P values in Figures are generally referred to comparison between a sample and the control (full medium/mock) and are indicated as follows. Additional details regarding the specific experiments are reported in the Figure Legends. Repeat counts over repeated regions, defined by SOAPer, were analyzed using maSig package. Repeat variation of abundance during time of starvation was analyzed using edgeR, dR, and edgeR package. T-test was used when only two means, typically sample versus control, were compared, as specified in the figure legends. P values were indicated by a horizontal line at the top of the graphs, encompassing the two samples under analysis. The expression of the OA1 transgene and HDAC4, which are progressively up- and down-regulated during starvation, respectively, were used as internal controls. Repeats significantly up- or downregulated (104 and 77, respectively) were selected based on a P value <0.05 (unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, assuming equal variance) and analyzed for their class enrichment by a Fisher Exact test. Differentially expressed repeat subfamilies were identified by averaging three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls. The enrichment analysis was performed separately for up and down regulated genes, or with all differentially expressed genes together (both), using the KEGG database. Out of 1396 annotated subfam families, 172 species displayed a differential expression profile during starvation. The analysis was done with correction for the background of all expressed genes (about 13600 genes showing an average expression over 3 starvation and 3 control samples of at least 5 counts) and by using default parameters (adjusted P value and q-value cut-off of 0.05 and 0.2). Clustering of differentially expressed repeats, according to their expression pattern, reveals profiles comparable to the behavior of the transgene in the same conditions. LTR-retroelements are significantly enriched among repeats that are upregulated upon starvation, while LINEs are significantly enrichment among repeats That are downregulated. These findings suggest that EAA starvation induces genome-wide effects involving repetitive elements, and that—among major repeat classes—it upregulates in particular the expression of ERVs. In particular, a large fraction of ribosomal protein mRNAs is downregulated upon Met/Cys starvation (Fig 2A and 2C; S1 File), consistent with the notion that their genes–despite being scattered throughout the genome—are coordinately expressed in a variety of conditions. This reduced expression may depend on multiple pathways that control ribosome biogenesis in response to external stimuli, including downregulation of mTORC1, 44], the activation activity of the Mycc R gene, or the activation of the ISR gene, possibly as described in Myc c. Myc and ISR, 44. Differentially expressed genes between three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls were selected based on a P value <0.05 and a fold change of at least 2, leading to a total of 996 upregulated, and 1037 downregulated genes. Most EAA-deficiencies induced reactivation of the OA1 or GFP transgenes in all four cell lines, with the notable exception of Trp deprivation, which consistently resulted in no or minimal reactivation. The analysis of single Met or Cys starvation, both at the protein and transcript levels, revealed an exclusive role of Met deprivation in transgene reactivation, consistent with the notion that Cys is not an EAA (S3D and S3E Fig). EAA deprivation in HeLa and HepG2 cells induces reactivating of silent HeLa-OA1 (HeLa-A1) and Hep2-A2 (HepG2-G2) transgenES. EAA depriving cells of Thr, Val, Tyr, and His always gave an efficient response. Leu, Gln and Lys elicited evident responses in some cases, but not in others. Depletion of Phe significantly altered multiple reference genes used for normalization and therefore was eventually omitted from the analysis (not shown) mTORC1 inhibition and GCN2 activation trigger the best-known signaling pathways responding to AA starvation. We tested whether direct pharmacological activation of this kinase is sufficient to trigger the transgene reactivation similarly to starvation. In addition, we used pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR to corroborate previous negative results in HeLa cells  in the other cell lines under study. We found that CHOP expression is increased in all EAA-starvation conditions, but not in the absence of Ala, in all tested cell lines. Treatment with L-Histidinol results in efficient reactivation of the transGene in HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells,but not in He La cells. The upregulation of CHOP does not parallel quantitatively that of theTransgene, neither appears sufficient to induce it. While the ISR appears widely activated upon EAA starvation, the up regulation of its downstream effector CHOP only partly correlates with transgenes reactivation and may not be sufficient to induced it. The activation of the IsR upon AA starvation suggests that GCN 2 may be involved in the reactivation response. We previously showed that inhibition of m TORC1 is not sufficient to reproduce transg Gene reactivation in He la cells. In HepG2-OA1 cells, L-Histidinol is sufficient to elicit extremely high levels of transgene reactivation, possibly due to an indirect effect of mTOR inhibition on GCN2 activity. C2C12-GFP cells efficiently reactivate thetransgene upon treatment with L- historicinol, but not PP242 (S5B Fig) The ISR is neither sufficient nor necessary to induce transgenes reactivation in HepG1 cells. We tested the role of the core upstream event of the ISR, namely the phosphorylation of eIF2α, which can be induced by pharmacological treatments. Salubrinal, a specific phosphatase inhibitor, blocks both constitutive and ER stress-induced phosphat enzyme complexes against eif2α. We found that, while the IsR is activated upon Salub rinal treatment, as shown by increased CHOP expression, it does not induce OA1 transgne reactivation (Fig 5B). The ISr is neither necessary nor sufficient to induce O a1 reactivation. We also found that L- historicalinol does not trigger upregulation of the O aa1 transGene in Hep G2-oa1 cells or ATF4 in the absence of the drug. These findings are consistent with previous reports. To test whether the ISR is necessary to trigger the transgene response to L-Histidinol, we used the chemical compound ISRIB, which inhibits the activation of ISR. We found that the reactivation of the OA1 transgenes is neither abolished, nor reduced by KO of GCN2, thus excluding that this kinase is necessary for the response to EAA starvation in HeLa-OA1 cells (Fig 6B and 6C).GCN2 knockout does not interfere with transg Gene reactivation in Hela cells. None of these clones express GCN 2 at the protein level, as shown by immunoblotting. All three clones showed a very low amount of residual protein—of any kind—of the original GC2 gene, compared to the original HepG2 gene in clone E23, F22 and F27. Genomic characterization confirmed the presence of mutations on both alleles of exon 1 in clone 183#11, and on bothalleles ofexon 6 in clone 239#1. The clones showed multiple alleles in exon1 in clone 185#5, which was not characterized further at the genomic level (S6 Fig). The clones were cultured in media deprived of Met/Cys or Thr (corresponding to the most effective treatments in this cell line; see Fig 3A) for 24–48 h. We found that the reactivation of the OA1 transgene is neither abolished, nor reduced by KO of GCN2, as in HeLa cells. To further confirm this result, we knocked-downGCN2 by RNA interference (RNAi) and incubated the cells with or without L-Histidinol for 6 h. As shown in Fig 8, treatment of HepG2-OA1 cells with L-histidinols results in efficient transg Gene reactivation. Taken together, these data strongly support the conclusion that GCN 2 is not necessary for transgGene reactivation in response to EAA starvation, either in HeLA or in HepG 2 cells."
What experimental techniques were used to study the quantum dot structures in this research?,"\section{Introduction}

Despite the rise of graphene and other 2D materials, semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) are still regarded as strong candidates for the next generation of high-performance ultrascaled transistors~\cite{Cao_IBM_2015,IBM_2017,3D_CNT_FET} as well as for opto-electronic devices~\cite{Review_Avouris,CNT_photonics} such as chip-scale electronic-photonic platforms~\cite{Pernice_2016} or low-threshold near-infrared tunable micro-lasers~\cite{Graf_2017}. 
Engineering a quantum dot (QD) along a (suspended) semiconducting SWNT foreshadows promising opportunities in the field of quantum information processing and sensing through recently proposed schemes such as detection and manipulation of single spins via coupling to vibrational motion~\cite{Palyi_2012}, optomechanical cooling~\cite{Wilson_Rae_2012} as well as all optical manipulation of electron spins~\cite{Galland_all_optical_2008}. Furthermore, the quasi one-dimensional geometry of SWNTs allows for defining tunable p-n junctions induced by electrostatic doping through local gates~\cite{Buchs_JAP,tunable_pn_2011}. Combining a well-defined QD within such a p-n junction structure could constitute a crucial building-block for the realization of highly desirable electrically driven, on-demand single photon emitters operating at telecom wavelength, based $e.g.$ on a turnstile device architecture~\cite{turnstile_1994,turnstile_1999}.
In practice, QDs in carbon nanotubes have been reported predominantly for two different confinement structures: i) Engineered tunneling barriers at metal-nanotube contacts~\cite{Pablo04nat} and/or by gate electrodes, used \emph{e.g.} to manipulate single electron spins~\cite{Laird:2015}, ii) Unintentional localization potentials stemming from environmental disorder~\cite{Hofmann_2016}, allowing for single-photon emission mediated by localization of band-edge excitons to QD states~\cite{CNT_photonics,Hoegele_2008,Walden_Newman_2012,Hofmann_2013,Pernice_2016_2}. Both types of structures are usually operated at cryogenic temperature due to small energy scales ranging from a few to few tens of millielectronvolts.
\\
\indent Another technique for achieving confinement in SWNTs makes use of artificial defects such as covalently bound oxygen or aryl functionalization groups on the side walls of semiconducting SWNTs, inducing deep exciton trap states allowing for single-photon emission at room temperature~\cite{Htoon_2015,tunable_QD_defects}. Also, carrier confinement between defect pairs acting as strong scattering centers has been reported for mechanically induced defects~\cite{Postma_SET} as well as for ion-induced defects with reported level spacings up to 200 meV in metallic SWNTs~\cite{Buchs_PRL}. The latter technique, combined with recent progress in controlling defects structure and localization~\cite{Robertson_2012,Yoon_2016,Laser_writing_2017} offers a high potential for engineering a broad set of SWNT-based quantum devices operating at room temperature. 
\\
\indent Here, we demonstrate confinement of electrons and holes in sub-10 nm QD structures defined by ion-induced defect pairs along the axis of semiconducting SWNTs. Using low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), bound states with level spacings of the order of 100 meV and larger are resolved in energy and space. By solving the one-dimensional Schr\""odinger equation over a piecewise constant potential model, the effects of asymmetric defect scattering strength as well as the influence of the Au(111) substrate such as terrace edges on the bound states structure are remarkably well reproduced. By means of ab-initio calculations based on density functional theory and Green's functions, we find that single (SV) and double vacancies (DV) as well as chemisorbed nitrogen ad-atoms are good candidates to produce QDs with the experimentally observed features. These simulations also allow to study the scattering profile as a function of energy for different defect combinations.

\section{Experimental section}

The experiments have been performed in a commercial (Omicron) low temperature STM setup operating at $\sim5$~K in ultra high vacuum. Topography images have been recorded in constant current mode with a grounded sample, using mechanically cut Pt/Ir tips. Differential conductance $dI/dV$ spectra, proportional in first approximation to the local density of states (LDOS)~\cite{Tersoff85} have been recorded using a lock-in amplifier technique. The LDOS spatial evolution along a nanotube axis is obtained by $dI/dV(x,V)$ maps built by a series of equidistant $dI/dV$ spectra. Spatial extent mismatches between topography images and consecutive $dI/dV(x,V)$ maps have been systematically corrected~\cite{Buchs_Ar}, and the metallic nature of the tip has been systematically checked on the gold substrate to prevent any tip artefacts before recording STM or/and STS data sets. 
\\
\indent Nanotube samples were made of extremely pure high-pressure CO conversion (HiPCo) SWNTs~\cite{Smalley01} with a diameter distribution centered around 1 nm, FWHM $\sim$ 0.3 nm~\cite{Buchs_conf}. The measured intrinsic defect density was below one defect every 200 nm. SWNTs were deposited on atomically flat Au(111) surfaces from a 1,2-dichloroethane suspension, followed by an in-situ annealing process~\cite{Buchs_APL_07,Buchs_Ar}.
\\
\indent Local defects in SWNTs have been created in-situ by exposure to: (i) Medium energy $\sim$ 200 eV argon ions (Ar$^{+}$) produced by an ion gun \cite{Buchs_Ar,Buchs_PRL}, (ii) Low energy (few eV's) nitrogen ions (N$^{+}$) produced by a 2.45 GHz ECR plasma source~\cite{Buchs_APL_07,Buchs_NJP_07}. In both cases, the exposure parameters have been calibrated to reach an average defect separation along the SWNTs of about 10 nm~\cite{Buchs_Ar,Buchs_APL_07}.

\section{Results and discussion}
\subsection{Experimental LDOS patterns}
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{Figure_1.pdf}
  \caption{\label{exp_data_1} (a)-(b) 3D topography images (processed with WSXM~\cite{WSXM}) of SWNT I with Ar$^{+}$ ions-induced defects, with sample-tip bias voltage ($V_\mathrm{S}$) 1 V and tunneling current $I_\mathrm{S}$ 0.1 nA.

\end{figure}
In Fig.~\ref{exp_data_1} (a) and (b), we show 3D STM images of the same semiconducting SWNT (referred as SWNT I in the following) with Ar$^{+}$ ions-induced defect sites labeled $d1-d5$ . Panel (d) shows a 3D STM image of a second semiconducting SWNT (referred as SWNT II) with N$^{+}$ ions-induced defect sites labeled $d6-d7$. In both cases, defect sites typically appear as hillock-like protrusions with an apparent height ranging from 0.5~{\AA} to 4~{\AA} and an apparent lateral extension varying between 5~{\AA} and 30~{\AA}~\cite{Buchs_NJP_07,Buchs_Ar,Thesis_Buchs}. 
\\
\indent The resulting $dI/dV(x,V)$ maps recorded along the horizontal dashed line drawn in the STM images (b) and (d) are displayed in panels (c) and (e) in Fig.~\ref{exp_data_1}, respectively. Defect signatures in the LDOS in both cases are characterized by deep in-gap states at the defects positions. This is consistent with the expected defect structures, $i.e.$ mainly SVs, DVs and combinations thereof for collisions with Ar$^{+}$ ions~\cite{Buchs_Ar} and bridgelike N ad-atom for collisions with N$^{+}$ ions~\cite{Thesis_Buchs,Nitrogen_prb_07}. Note that gap states at energy levels $\sim$~0.2 eV and $\sim$~0.05 eV in panels (c) and (e), respectively, are shifted to the right from $d3$ by about 1 nm and to the right from $d6$ by about 2 nm. This indicates the presence of intrinsic or ion-induced defects on the lateral or bottom side wall of the SWNTs~\cite{Kra01prb}, not visible in the topographic images. These defects are labelled $d3'$ and $d6'$, respectively.

\end{figure}
\indent Remarkably, the $dI/dV(x,V)$ maps in Fig.~\ref{exp_data_1} exhibit several broad discrete states in the conduction bands of SWNT I, II (white dashed boxes in panel (c) and (e), respectively) and in the valence band of SWNT I (white dashed box in panel (c)), characterized by a modulation of the $dI/dV$ signals in the spatial direction between pairs of consecutive defect sites $d3'-d4$ and $d6'-d7$. Enlarged plots of these boxed regions are displayed in Fig.~\ref{exp_data_Ar}(a)-(b) and Fig.~\ref{exp_data_N}(a) for SWNTs I and II, respectively. In the conduction bands, cross-sectional curves recorded along the black horizontal dashed lines labelled m1--m3 in Fig.~\ref{exp_data_Ar}(a) and m1--m4 in Fig.~\ref{exp_data_N}(a) are plotted below the LDOS panels. These clearly reveal one to three and respectively one to four spatially equidistant maxima. The number of maxima increases for increasing $\left|V_\mathrm{bias}\right|$ and the measured level spacings between consecutive discrete states is of the order of 100 meV and larger for both cases. This indicates that defect sites $d3'-d4$ and $d6'-d7$, respectively separated by 12.1 nm and 11.2 nm, act as strong scattering centers able to confine carriers in semiconducting SWNTs~\cite{Buchs_PRL,Bercioux_prb_2011}. Such intrananotube QD structures will be referred as QD I (in SWNT I) and QD II (in SWNT II) in the following. We estimated the level spacings in the conduction band of QD I to 98 meV (m1-m2) and 116 meV (m2-m3). For QD II, we measured 122 meV (m1-m2), 185 meV (m2-m3) and 210 meV (m3-m4).
\\
\indent In the valence band of SWNT I, discrete states with level spacings of the order of 80-90 meV, with one clear maximum at the level m-1, can also be distinguished between defect sites $d3'-d4$ in Fig.~\ref{exp_data_Ar}(b). The discretization of the states indicates that this QD structure also confines holes. Discrete states starting from m-2 and lower show less well defined structures compared to the conduction band states. In the case of SWNT II, no clear discrete states are observed in the valence band (see supplementary information). These observations are most probably the result of an energy dependent scattering strength of the defects, respectively $d3'$-$d4$ and $d6'$-$d7$, leading here to a weaker confinement in the valence band. Such energy dependence is well known for metallic SWNTs~\cite{Chico96,vac_2007,mayrhofer:2011,Bockrath_Science01} and is corroborated by our ab-initio calculations. Note that mixing effects with defect states and substrate-induced effects~\cite{substrate_effects} cannot be ruled out.
\\
\indent Another remarkable feature in the LDOS is the strong spatial asymmetry of the lowest energy states m1 and m-1 in QD I and m1 in QD II. In QD I, m1 is shifted to the right side of the dot while m-1 is shifted to the left side. Higher states m2 and m3 show more symmetry in terms of position of the maxima relative to the center of the QD. In QD II, m1 is shifted to the right side of the QD. We attribute the observed lowest energy states asymmetry (for electrons as well as for holes) in part to their strong sensitivity to weak potential modulations within the QD structure (as we will show in section \ref{1D}). For QD I, this assertion is supported by the observation of a 0.25 nm high Au(111) terrace edge located around the center of the QD, leading to a supported-suspended interface (see white dashed lines in Fig.~\ref{exp_data_1}(b) and more topographic details in Fig.~S2(a)-(d) in supplementary information). Such configurations have been reported to induce a rigid shift in the SWNT bands~\cite{Clair_2011}, for instance here a down-shift in the right side of QD I corresponding to the ""suspended"" portion between two terraces. In QD II, we attribute the spatial shift of m1 to a potential modulation induced by a layer of disordered impurities, most probably residua from the 1,2-dichloroethane suspension, lying between the gold substrate and the SWNT (see Fig.~\ref{exp_data_1}(d) and Fig.~S2(e)-(h) in supplementary information). 
\\
\indent Also, the LDOS in QD I and II (Fig.~\ref{exp_data_Ar}(a) and Fig.~\ref{exp_data_N}(a), respectively) reveals asymmetric patterns with curved stripes oriented from top left to bottom right for QD I and from bottom left to top right for QD II. These are characteristic signatures for defect pairs with different scattering strengths~\cite{Bercioux_prb_2011,Buchs_PRL}. For instance here, the left defect in QD I ($d3'$) has a larger scattering strength than the right one ($d4$), while the right defect in QD II ($d7$) has a larger scattering strength than the left one ($d6'$). 
\\
\indent The exact atomic structure of the defects could in principle be determined from a comparison of $dI/dV$ spectra with simulated first-principle LDOS signatures of expected defect types. In reality, this is hampered by the large number of possible geometries to simulate, including complex multiple defect structures~\cite{Buchs_Ar}, together with the large unit cells of the semiconducting chiral SWNTs studied here.
\\
\subsection{1D piecewise constant potential model}
\label{1D}
To better understand the physical origins of the non-trivial signatures of the quantized states, we model the experimental $dI/dV$ maps by solving the time independent one-dimensional Schr\""odinger equation over a piecewise constant potential model of QD I and QD II. The scattering centers are approximated by semi-transparent rectangular tunneling barriers leading to a square confinement potential~\cite{Laird:2015}. This is supported by previous results on defect-induced confinement in metallic SWNTs using the same experimental conditions~\cite{Buchs_PRL} and is consistent with ab-initio simulations presented later in this work. The potential modulation within the QD is approximated by a potential step. The resulting potential geometries are illustrated with gray shaded areas in Fig.~\ref{exp_data_Ar} (c) and (d) and Fig.~\ref{exp_data_N}(b). Dispersion relations $E(k)$ can be extracted experimentally from the quantized states wavefunctions by measuring the energy and corresponding momenta in the left and right sides of the QDs. The wavevectors $k$ are determined using stationary wave-like fitting functions~\cite{Buchs_PRL} displayed with dashed red curves in Figs.~\ref{exp_data_Ar}(a)-(b) and ~\ref{exp_data_N}(a)). From this procedure, the potential step height and position can be estimated (see supplementary information). The experimental data sets $E(k)$ are plotted in the right panels of Figs.~\ref{exp_data_Ar}(a) and \ref{exp_data_N}(a) together with dispersion relations from a third-nearest neighbor tight-binding calculation closely approximating ab-initio results~\cite{Reich_TB_2002}. These chirality-dependent tight-binding dispersion relations, calculated within an extended Brillouin zone resulting from the defect-induced breaking of the translation invariance~\cite{Bercioux_prb_2011}, are used in the Hamiltonian of our one-dimensional model. Taking into account the measured chiral angle, diameter distribution~\cite{Buchs_conf} and measured bandgaps, we find the best match with chiralities $(7,6)$ for QD I and $(11,1)$ for QD II (see supplementary information). 
\\
\indent Once chiralities together with potential step heights and positions are optimized, one can fit the height and width of the rectangular tunneling barriers in order to reproduce the experimental level spacings and general LDOS patterns. On a qualitative ground, a symmetric double barrier system results in the formation of spatially symmetric discrete bound states. Increasing both barrier heights simultaneously shifts the bound state energy levels and level spacings up. This leads to sharper bound states as the confinement in the QD is made stronger thus increasing the lifetime of the confined electrons. Increasing the barrier thickness with constant inner edge separation does not affect much the level spacings but further sharpens the bound states. Any asymmetry introduced by a change in the width or height of one single barrier leads to broader bound states. The presence of a potential step modifies the LDOS in lifting the levels of the bound states, with a more pronounced effect on the lower states. In QD I and II, the center of each barrier is aligned with the center of the gap states ($d3'$-$d4$ for QD I and $d6'$-$d7$ in QD II) and the width ratio is kept proportional to the ratio of the spatial extent of the gap states. Thus, by increasing the width of the barriers, we decrease the length of the QD leading to higher level spacings, and vice versa. The experimental level spacings can then be approximated by tuning both barrier widths in the same ratio and the heights individually, knowing that the scattering strength of $d3'$ ($d7$) is larger than $d4$ ($d6'$) according to the observed asymmetry in the LDOS described above \footnote{The transmission probability through a rectangular tunneling barrier is given by $T=\left( 1+\frac{V^{2}\sinh^{2}\left( a \cdot \sqrt{2m^{*}(V-E)}/\hbar \right)}{4E(V-E)} \right)^{-1}$, where $V$ and $a$ are respectively the barrier height and width. For the argument in the $\sinh$ sufficiently small such that $\sinh(x)\simeq x$, it can be shown that $a$ and $V$ can be coupled such that the transmission probability becomes a function of the area under the barrier $A=a\cdot V$, with $T=\left( 1+ \frac{m^{*}A^{2}}{2\hbar^{2}E} \right)^{-1}$. In our case, this condition is not satisfied and thus the barrier geometries are tuned empirically to fit the experimental level spacings.}. 
\\
\indent For QD I, we find a good match in the conduction band for the barrier heights $V_\mathrm{d3'}=1$ eV and $V_\mathrm{d4}=0.85$ eV, widths $a_\mathrm{d3'}=a_\mathrm{d4}=$ 3.4 nm,  and potential step $V_\mathrm{L}-V_\mathrm{R}=60$ meV. With these parameters, the spatial profile of the obtained quantized states (see lower subpanels in Fig.~\ref{exp_data_Ar}(a) and (c)) reproduces the experimental modulation features remarkably well. Also, the simulated LDOS displays a pattern with curved stripes oriented from top left to bottom right, as observed experimentally, due to a left barrier with a larger scattering strength. In the valence band, although modes m-2 and lower do not show a well defined structure in the spatial direction, thinner barriers with dimensions $a_\mathrm{d3'/d4}=2.5$ nm, $V_\mathrm{d3'/d4}=-0.4$ eV, leading to a slightly longer QD length (9.6 nm compared to 8.7 nm in the conduction band) can reproduce the measured level spacings very well. 
\\
\indent For QD II, we observed that the measured energy levels are overestimated by a factor $\alpha\sim1.29$, presumably due to a voltage division effect induced by the impurity layer mentioned above (see details in supplementary information). We find a good agreement with the experimental LDOS with the parameters: $V_{d3'}=V_{d4}\simeq$ 0.47 eV, $a_\mathrm{d6'}=1.5$ nm, $a_\mathrm{d7}=2.6$ nm and $U_\mathrm{C}=V_\mathrm{L}-V_\mathrm{R}\simeq 47$ meV. Note that in Fig.~\ref{exp_data_N}(b) the barrier and potential heights are multiplied by $\alpha$ to allow a direct comparison with the experimental LDOS. The simulated LDOS shows a pattern with curved stripes oriented from bottom left to top right, as observed experimentally, due to a right barrier exhibiting a larger scattering strength. Also, the spatial profile of the obtained bound states (see lower subpanels in Fig.~\ref{exp_data_N}(a) and (b)) reproduces the experimental features quite well. Note also that one can distinguish an isolated state in the experimental LDOS at an energy level between m1 and m2, about in the middle of the QD. This state that prevented an accurate fit of the state m2 in the right QD part is attributed to a spatial feature visible in the STM topography image in Fig.~\ref{exp_data_Ar}(d) (see also supplementary information, Fig.S2(f)), probably a physisorbed impurity which does not affect the LDOS significantly.
\\
\subsection{Ab-initio calculations}
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=16cm]{Figure_4.pdf}

(h) Tight-binding (black curve) and ab-initio dispersion relations (green circles) for a pristine $(17,0)$ SWNT with $E_\mathrm{n}(k_\mathrm{n})$ data sets extracted from (e)-(g).}
\end{figure}
In order to elucidate the physical nature of the electron/hole confining scattering centers, we performed ab-initio simulations based on a combination of density functional theory~\cite{pbe,paw,vasp_paw,VASP2}, maximally localized Wannier orbitals~\cite{transportwannier90} and Green's functions (see supplementary information). Without loss of generality, we have simulated short unit cell semiconducting zigzag SWNTs with different combinations of the most probable defect structures. Results for vacancy defects likely being induced by 200 eV Ar$^{+}$ ions, separated by about 11 nm in a $(16,0)$ SWNT are shown in Fig.~\ref{num_data}(a)-(c) with DV-DV, DV-SV and SV-SV pairs, respectively. The LDOS displays midgap states at the defect positions as expected as well as defect states in the valence band~\cite{Buchs_Ar}. Most importantly, clear quantized states with a number of maxima increasing with energy are observed between the defects in the conduction band, emphasizing the ability of SVs and DVs to confine carriers. For the asymmetric configuration DV-SV, one can distinguish faint curved stripe patterns oriented from top left to bottom right, indicating a larger scattering strength for DVs compared to SVs. This is consistent with observations in transport experiments~\cite{Gomez05nm}. On the other hand, the patterns in the valence band strongly depend on the defect types. Discrete states can be distinguished for the DV-DV case, with m-2 being mixed with defect states. For the DV-SV case, clear curved stripe patterns oriented from bottom left to top right indicate again a stronger scattering strength for DV. Also, broader states are observed, indicating that the scattering strength of DVs and SVs is weaker in the valence band compared to the conduction band.
\\
\indent More insight on the energy dependent scattering strength for each defect pair configuration can be obtained by extracting the wavevector $k_\mathrm{n}(E_\mathrm{n})$ for each resonant state. This data set is plotted in Fig.~\ref{num_data}(d) for the conduction and valence bands together with the $(16,0)$ dispersion relations calculated from the third-nearest neighbor TB model and from the ab-initio calculation for the pristine nanotube. A first observation is the excellent agreement between TB and ab-initio results, further validating the method used in Figs.~\ref{exp_data_Ar}(a)-(b) and ~\ref{exp_data_N}(a). The vertical dashed lines indicate the limiting $k_\mathrm{n,\infty}=\frac{\pi \cdot n}{L}$ values corresponding to the closed system (infinite hard walls potential) with $L=11.1$ nm being the defect-defect distance. In the conduction band, we find that $k_\mathrm{n}(E_\mathrm{n})=\frac{\pi \cdot n}{L_\mathrm{eff}(n)} < k_\mathrm{n,\infty}$, indicating that the effective lengths $L_\mathrm{eff}(n)$ of the QD are larger than $L$ ($i.e.$ the resonant states wavefunctions are characterized by penetrating evanescent modes inside the defect scattering potential), as expected for an open system. The shortest $L_\mathrm{eff}(n)$ are obtained for the DV-DV configuration with 12.1 nm (m1), 13.1 nm (m2) and 12.9 nm (m3), which we attribute to wider scattering potential profiles for DVs compared to SVs. In the valence band, we find that $k_\mathrm{n}(E_\mathrm{n})=\frac{\pi \cdot n}{L_\mathrm{eff}(n)} > k_\mathrm{n,\infty}$, with $L_\mathrm{eff}(n)$ values between 7.9 nm (DV-DV, m-1) and 9.66 nm (DV-SV, m-2). We attribute this pronounced QD shortening to wider scattering potential profiles of both DVs and SVs in the valence band, probably due to mixing with wide spread defect states in the valence band.
\\
\indent Ab-initio calculations for different defect pairs combinations containing at least one N ad-atom, $i.e.$ N-DV, N-SV and N-N, are presented in Fig.~\ref{num_data}(e)-(h) for a $(17,0)$ SWNT, along with details on the defects geometries. Remarkably, clear QD states are generated for all three configurations, underlining the potential of N ad-atoms to confine carriers in semiconducting SWNTs and thus to generate intrananotube QDs. 
\\
\indent In order to demonstrate the scattering strengths of the different defects, we calculated the energy dependent conductance in addition to the LDOS for the different combinations of the QD defining scattering defects on the $(16,0)$ and $(17,0)$ SWNTs, see supplementary information. Generally we can observe strong conductance modulation of the order of 30-40\% with regard to the pristine CNT for all three tested defects (double vacancies DV, single vacancies SV and chemisorbed C-N) with the DVs having the largest scattering strength in the CB and VB.

\indent Note that the choice of the zigzag SWNT chiralities in the two different ab-initio scenarios is motivated by the different effective masses of both chiralities ($m^{*}_{(17,0)}>m^{*}_{(16,0)}$) which is typical for chirality families $(3n-1,0)$ and $(3n-2,0)$~\cite{ZZ_families}. Taking advantage of recent reports on SWNT chirality control~\cite{chirality_control_EMPA,chirality_control_chinese,chirality_chemistry}, this property could be used in practice to design QDs with different level spacings for the same QD length. From an application point of view, however, QDs generated by DVs will have far superior stability at room temperature due to their high migration barrier above 5 eV ($\sim$~1 eV for single vacancy)~\cite{Kra06vm}. This value drops down by at least 2 eV for N ad-atoms depending on their chemisorption configuration~\cite{Nitrogen_prb_07,Yma05nitr}.
\\
\indent Our ab-initio simulations do not take into account any substrate effect. In the experimental case, the carriers can decay through the substrate, thus limiting their lifetime. This leads to state broadening, measured between about 60 meV up to 120 meV in QD I and II, while the quantized states widths in ab-initio simulations vary between about 5 meV and 45 meV. This suggests that a better contrast of the experimental quantized states, especially in the valence band, could be achieved by lowering the nanotubes-substrate interaction through $e.g.$ the insertion of atomically thin insulating NaCl films~\cite{Ruffieux_Nature_2016}. This would allow to gain more insight on the electronic structure of the QDs as well as in the associated scattering physics at the confining defects~\cite{Buchs_PRL}. 

\section{Conclusions and outlook}
In summary, using low-temperature STM/STS measurements supported by an analytical model and ab-initio simulations, we have demonstrated that intrananotube quantum dots with confined electron and hole states characterized by energy level spacings well above thermal broadening at room temperature can be generated in semiconducting SWNTs by structural defects such as vacancies and di-vacancies, as well as nitrogen ad-atoms. These results, combined with recent progresses in type and spatial control in the formation of defects~\cite{Robertson_2012,Yoon_2016,Laser_writing_2017} as well as chirality control~\cite{tunable_QD_defects}, hold a high potential for applications in the design of SWNT based quantum devices. These include $e.g.$ electrically driven single-photon emitters operating at room temperature and telecom wavelength. In this context, the observation of quantum confinement effects in the emitted light of cut, sub-10 nm, semiconducting SWNTs~\cite{Dai_2008} shall be seen as an additional motivation for investigating the optical properties of our ""QD with leads"" building-blocks. These would include $e.g.$ studying optical transitions selection rules for different types and configurations of defect pairs~\cite{sel_rules_2006} associated with experimental studies such as photoluminescence~\cite{Lefebvre06} combined to $g^{(2)}$ correlation measurements~\cite{Hofmann_2013} in suspended SWNT devices as well as photocurrent imaging~\cite{Buchs_Nat_comm} and spectroscopy~\cite{Gabor_2009}.

",['Low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS).'],4297,multifieldqa_en,en,,5b978c8d5792b07ad99da0fc2639c6046051e9c29825ad25," Despite the rise of graphene and other 2D materials, semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) are still regarded as strong candidates for the next generation of high-performance ultrascaled transistors. Engineering a quantum dot (QD) along a (suspended) SWNT foreshadows promising opportunities in the field of quantum information processing and sensing. Using low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), bound states with level spacings of 100V and larger in energy and space are remarkably well reproduced on Au(111) substrate. By solving the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation, defect scattering strength as well as the influence of the bound edges on the bound states are remarkably remarkably reproduced on the Au( 111) substrate such as terrace on the edge of the substrate. These simulations also allow us to study the scattering profile as a function of en-initio density and Green's functions based on functional theory and Green’s theory of quantum mechanics. We demonstrate confinement of electrons and holes in sub-10 nm QD structures defined by ion-induced defect pairs along the axis of semiconducted SWNTs. We find that single (SV) and double vacancies (DV) are good candidates to produce QDs with the experimentally observed features. Nanotube samples were made of extremely pure high-pressure CO conversion (HiPCo) SWNTs. The measured intrinsic defect density was below one defect every 200 nm. The experiments have been performed in a commercial (Omicron) low temperature STM setup operating at $\sim5$~K in ultra high vacuum. Topography images have been recorded in constant current mode with a grounded sample, using mechanically cut Pt/Ir tips. Differential conductance $dI/dV$ spectra, proportional in first approximation to the local density of states (LDOS) were recorded using a lock-in amplifier technique. In both cases, the exposure parameters have been calibrated to reach an average defect separation along the SW NTs of about 10 nm. We show 3D topography images of SWNT I with Ar$^{+}$ ions-induced defects, with $V_\mathrm{S}=1$ V and tunneling current $I_\ mathrm{s}$ 0.1 nA. In the following images, we show SWNT II (referred as the following) with the same semiconducting SWNT sites labeled $d-d7$ and $1-d5$ Panel shows a second STM image of a second SWNTM image with an apparent protrusions height from 0.5 to 0.7 nm. Figure 2 shows QD I and II maps in conduction and valence bands. Lower subpanels contain QD states linecut profiles and stationary wave-like fits in left and right QD parts. Figure 3 shows the LDOS calculated from a one-dimensional piecewise constant potential model featuring potential barriers and a potential step. Figure 4 shows the potential step heigth with position of the potentialstep: 5.09 nm from the right barrier's center, barrier heights: $V_\mathrm{d3'}=1.6$ eV and barrier widths: $a_’mathrm’d6’’=0.5’ eV, $a’s’ ‘’ Math’: ‘Math’. Figure 5: The LDOS plots of these boxed regions are displayed in Fig. 4. Enlarged versions of the figures are available for download at: http://www.nasa.gov/doi/full/10.1103/nasa-4/4/5/6/7/8/8.5/7.5.5-1/4.4-1.4.1.1-1-4.3.1/1.3/1/3.4/1-3/3/2.4/. In QD I, m1 is shifted to the right side of the dot while m-1 is shift to the left side. Higher states m2 and m3 show more symmetry in terms of position of the maxima relative to the center of the QD. The exact atomic structure of the defects could in principle be determined from a comparison of $dI/dV$ spectra with simulated first-principle LDOS signatures of expected defect types. In reality, this is hampered by the large number of possible geometries to simulate, including complex multiple defect structures together with the large unit cells of the semiconducting chiral SWNTs studied here. To better understand the origins of the quantized signatures of the states, we model the experimental $I/DV maps by solving the Schringer equation over a piecewise potential model. The resulting potential is approximated by a square potential stepimated by the scattering centers. The results are illustrated with gray shaded shaded with shaded grays illustrated with black shaded. The model is consistent with the same experimental conditions using the SWNT-induced defect-induced confinement in SWNT I and SWNT II. We attribute the observed lowest energy states asymmetry (for electrons as well as for holes) in part to their strong sensitivity to weak potential modulations within theQD structure. areas in Fig. 2. Dispersion relations $E(k)$ can be extracted experimentally from the quantized states wavefunctions by measuring the energy and corresponding momenta in the left and right sides of the QDs. Taking into account the measured chiral angle, diameter distribution and measured bandgaps, we find the best match with chiralities for QD I and QD II. The experimental level spacings can then be approximated by tuning both barrier widths in the same ratio and the heights individually, knowing that the scattering strength of $d3'$ ($d7$) is larger than $d4' ($d6'$) according to the observed asymmetry in the LDOS described above. Increasing both barrier heights simultaneously shifts the bound state energy levels and level Spacings up. This leads to sharper bound states as the confinement in the QD is made stronger thus increasing the lifetime of the confined electrons. Increasing the barrier thickness with constant inner edge separation does not affect much thelevel spacings but further sharpens the bound states. Any asymmetry introduced by a change in the width or height of one single barrier leads to broader bound states and vice versa. The presence of a potential step modifies theLDOS in lifting the levels of thebound states, with a more pronounced effect on the lower states.  simulated LDOS shows a pattern with curved stripes oriented from bottom left to top right, as observed experimentally. In the valence band, although modes m-2 and lower do not show a well defined structure in the spatial direction, thinner barriers can reproduce the measured level spacings very well. For QD II, we observed that the measured energy levels are overestimated by a factor $\alpha\sim1.29$, presumably due to a voltage division effect induced by the impurity layer mentioned above (see details in supplementary information). We find a good agreement with the experimental LDOS with the parameters: $V_{d3'}=V_{ d4}\simeq$ 0.47 eV, $a_\mathrm{d6']=1.5$ nm and $U_\ Mathrm{C}= V_\Mathrm{L}-V_\ mathrm{R}\simesq 47$ meV. In order toidate the physical nature of the electron/hole confining scattering centers, we performed ab-initio simulations on a combination of combination of electron density functional theory and semiconducting SWNTs. Results for most probable defect structures are likely being induced by vacancy defects induced by 200 eV Ar. Curved stripe patterns oriented from top left to bottom right, indicating a larger scattering strength for DVs compared to SVs. This is consistent with observations in transport experiments. On the other hand, the patterns in the valence band strongly depend on the defect types. Discrete states can be distinguished for the DV-DV case, with m-2 being mixed with defect states. Also, broader states are observed, indicating that the scattering strength of DVs and SVs is weaker in theValence band compared to the conduction band. In order to demonstrate the scattering strengths of the different defects, we calculated the energy dependent scattering strengths for the different combinations of defects in SWNTs. For more information on the information we can observe, see the supplementary information for SWNT chiral chiral conditions and N ad-atoms in nanotube. The choice of the zig-zag chiral scenarios is motivated by the different masses of single vacancies and single vacancies for all three defects (double CNTs) with the largest DVs having the largest scattering strength in the CBB and V40 V.40 scenarios. For all three DV defects, single chemisorbed SV and C-N vacancies were tested with regard to the pristine CNT with the effective masses of 30-40. QDs generated by DVs will have far superior stability at room temperature due to their high migration barrier above 5 eV. In the experimental case, the carriers can decay through the substrate, thus limiting their lifetime. This leads to state broadening, measured between about 60 meV up to 120 meV in QD I and II, while the quantized states widths in ab-initio simulations vary between about 5 meV and 45 meV. This suggests that a better contrast of the experimental quantizedStates, especially in the valence band, could be achieved by lowering the nanotubes-substrate interaction through $e.g. the insertion of atomically thin insulating NaCl films. This would allow to gain more insight on the electronic structure of the QDs as well as in the associated scattering physics at the confining defects. These results, combined with recent progresses in type and spatial control in the formation of defects, hold a high potential for applications in the design of SWNT based quantum devices.

Diuretic – A class of drugs used to lower blood pressure. Also known as “water pills”.
Dobutamine stress echocardiography: This is a form of a stress echocardiogram diagnostic test. But instead of exercising on a treadmill or exercise bike to stress the heart, the stress is obtained by giving a drug that stimulates the heart and makes it “think” it’s exercising. The test is used to evaluate your heart and valve function if you are unable to exercise. It is also used to determine how well your heart tolerates activity, and your likelihood of having coronary artery disease (blocked arteries), and it can evaluate the effectiveness of your cardiac treatment plan. See also TTE and Stress Echocardiogram.
Dressler’s syndrome – Happens to a small number of people three to four weeks after a heart attack. The heart muscle that died during the attack sets the immune system in motion, calling on lymphocytes, one of the white blood cells, to infiltrate the coverings of the heart (pericardium) and the lungs (pleura). It also starts generating antibodies, which attack those two coverings. Chest pain (CP) is the predominant symptom; treated with anti-inflammatory drugs.
Dual Antiplatelet Therapy – Medications that block the formation of blood clots by preventing the clumping of platelets (examples Plavix, Effient, Brillinta, Ticlid, etc.) are often prescribed along with aspirin as part of what’s known as dual antiplatelet therapy, especially to patients who have undergone PCI and stent implantation.

Endothelial dysfunction affects the ability of these cells to help dilate blood vessels, control inflammation or prevent blood clots. The endothelium is associated with most forms of cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney failure, and severe viral infections.
Enhanced External Counterpulsation – EECP is an FDA-approved non-invasive, non-drug treatment for angina. It works by promoting the development of collateral coronary arteries. The therapy is widely used in prominent heart clinics such as the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins – especially for patients who are not good candidates for invasive procedures such as bypass surgery, angioplasty or stenting.
EP – Electrophysiologist: A cardiologist who has additional training in diagnosing/treating heart rhythm disorders.
EPS – Electrophysiology Study: A test that uses cardiac catheterization to study patients who have arrhythmias (abnormal hear rhythm). An electrical current stimulates the heart in an effort to provoke an arrhythmia, which is immediately treated with medications. EPS is used primarily to identify the origin of the arrhythmia and to test the effectiveness of medications used to treat abnormal heart rhythms.
EVH – Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting: To create the bypass graft during CABG open heart surgery, a surgeon will remove or “harvest” healthy blood vessels from another part of the body, often from the patient’s leg or arm. This vessel becomes a graft, with one end attaching to a blood source above and the other end below the blocked area. See CABG.
Exercise stress test – An exercise test (walking/running on a treadmill or pedalling a stationary bike) to make your heart work harder and beat faster. An EKG is recorded while you exercise to monitor any abnormal changes in your heart under stress, with or without the aid of drugs to enhance this assessment. See also: MIBI, Echocardiogram, Nuclear Stress Test.
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) – A genetic predisposition to dangerously high cholesterol levels. FH is an inherited disorder that can lead to aggressive and premature cardiovascular disease, including problems like heart attacks, strokes, or narrowing of the heart valves.
Femoral Artery: a major artery in your groin/upper thigh area, through which a thin catheter is inserted, eventually making its way into the heart during angioplasty to implant a stent; currently the most widely used angioplasty approach in the United States, but many other countries now prefer the Radial Artery access in the wrist.
FFR – Fractional Flow Reserve: A test used during coronary catheterization (angiogram) to measure pressure differences across a coronary artery stenosis (narrowing or blockage) defined as as the pressure behind a blockage relative to the pressure before the blockage.
HC – High Cholesterol: When fatty deposits build up in your coronary arteries.
HCTZ – Hydrochlorothiazide: A drug used to lower blood pressure; it acts by inhibiting the kidneys’ ability to retain water. Used to be called “water pills”.

IVUS – Intravascular Ultrasound: A form of echocardiography performed during cardiac catheterization in which a transducer (a device that can act as a transmitter (sender) and receiver of ultrasound information) is threaded into the heart blood vessels via a catheter; it’s used to provide detailed information about the blockage inside the blood vessels.
LAD – Left Anterior Descending coronary artery: One of the heart’s coronary artery branches from the left main coronary artery which supplies blood to the left ventricle.
LAFB – Left Anterior Fascicular Block: A cardiac condition,distinguished from Left Bundle Branch Block because only the anterior half of the left bundle branch is defective and more common than left posterior fascicular block.
LAHB – Left Anterior Hemiblock: The Left Bundle Branch divides into two major branches – the anterior and the posterior fascicles. Occasionally, a block can occur in one of these fascicles.
Left Circumflex Artery – The artery carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the body; it’s a branch of the Left Main Coronary Artery after the latter runs its course in between the aorta and the Main Pulmonary Artery.
Left Main Coronary Artery – The artery that branches from the aorta to supply oxygenated blood to the heart via the Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD) and the Left Circumflex Artery.
Lipids – fat-like substances found in your blood and body tissues; a lipid panel is a blood test that measures the level of specific lipids in blood to help assess your risk of cardiovascular disease, measuring four types of lipids: total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.
Lipoprotein-a or Lp(a) – molecules made of proteins and fat, carrying cholesterol and similar substances through the blood. A high level of Lp(a) is considered a risk factor for heart disease; detectable via a blood test.
Long QT syndrome (LQTS): A heart rhythm disorder that can potentially cause fast, chaotic heartbeats that may trigger a sudden fainting spell or seizure. In some cases, the heart may beat erratically for so long that it can cause sudden death.
LV – Left Ventricle – One of four chambers (two atria and two ventricles) in the human heart, it receives oxygenated blood from the left atrium via the mitral valve, and pumps it into the aorta via the aortic valve.
LVAD – Left ventricular assist device: A mechanical device that can be placed outside the body or implanted inside the body. An LVAD does not replace the heart – it “assists” or “helps” it pump oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the rest of the body, usually as a bridge to heart transplant.
LVH – Left Ventricular Hypertrophy: A thickening of the myocardium (muscle) of the Left Ventricle (LV) of the heart..
Lumen – The hollow area within a tube, such as a blood vessel.
Main Pulmonary Artery – Carries oxygen-depleted blood from the heart to the lungs.
MIBI – Nuclear Stress Test/Cardiac Perfusion Scan/Sestamibi: tests that are used to assess the blood flow to the heart muscle (myocardium) when it is stressed by exercise or medication, and to find out what areas of the myocardium have decreased blood flow due to coronary artery disease. This is done by injecting a tiny amount of radionuclide like thallium or technetium (chemicals which release a type of radioactivity called gamma rays) into a vein in the arm or hand.
Microvascular disease – a heart condition that causes impaired blood flow to the heart muscle through the small blood vessels of the heart. Symptoms mimic those of a heart attack. Also called Coronary Microvascular Disease or Small Vessel Disease. I live with this diagnosis and have written more about it here, here and here.
Mini-Maze – a surgical procedure to treat atrial fibrillation, less invasive than what’s called the Cox Maze III procedure (a “cut-and-sew” procedure), and performed on a beating heart without opening the chest.
Mitral Valve: One of four valves in the heart, the structure that controls blood flow between the heart’s left atrium (upper chamber) and left ventricle (lower chamber). The mitral valve has two flaps (cusps). See also MV and/or Valves.
Mitral valve prolapse: a condition in which the two valve flaps of the mitral valve don’t close smoothly or evenly, but instead bulge (prolapse) upward into the left atrium; also known as click-murmur syndrome, Barlow’s syndrome or floppy valve syndrome.
MR – Mitral regurgitation: (also mitral insufficiency or mitral incompetence) a heart condition in which the mitral valve does not close properly when the heart pumps out blood. It’s the abnormal leaking of blood from the left ventricle, through the mitral valve and into the left atrium when the left ventricle contracts.
MRI – Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A technique that produces images of the heart and other body structures by measuring the response of certain elements (such as hydrogen) in the body to a magnetic field. An MRI can produce detailed pictures of the heart and its various structures without the need to inject a dye.
MS – Mitral Stenosis: A narrowing of the mitral valve, which controls blood flow from the heart’s upper left chamber (the left atrium) to its lower left chamber (the left ventricle). May result from an inherited (congenital) problem or from rheumatic fever.
MUGA – Multiple-Gated Acquisition Scanning: A non-invasive nuclear test that uses a radioactive isotope called technetium to evaluate the functioning of the heart’s ventricles.
Murmur – Noises superimposed on normal heart sounds. They are caused by congenital defects or damaged heart valves that do not close properly and allow blood to leak back into the originating chamber.
MV – Mitral Valve: The structure that controls blood flow between the heart’s left atrium (upper chamber) and left ventricle (lower chamber).
Myocardial Infarction (MI, heart attack) – The damage or death of an area of the heart muscle (myocardium) resulting from a blocked blood supply to the area. The affected tissue dies, injuring the heart.
Myocardium – The muscular tissue of the heart.
New Wall-Motion Abnormalities – Results seen on an echocardiogram test report (see NWMA, below).
Nitroglycerin – A medicine that helps relax and dilate arteries; often used to treat cardiac chest pain (angina). Also called NTG or GTN.
NSR – Normal Sinus Rhythm: The characteristic rhythm of the healthy human heart. NSR is considered to be present if the heart rate is in the normal range, the P waves are normal on the EKG/ECG, and the rate does not vary significantly.
NSTEMI – Non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction: The milder form of the two main types of heart attack. An NSTEMI heart attack does not produce an ST-segment elevation seen on an electrocardiogram test (EKG). See also STEMI.
Nuclear Stress Test – A diagnostic test that usually involves two exercise stress tests, one while you’re exercising on a treadmill/stationary bike or with medication that stresses your heart, and another set while you’re at rest. A nuclear stress test is used to gather information about how well your heart works during physical activity and at rest. See also: Exercise stress test, Nuclear perfusion test, MIBI.
Open heart surgery – Any surgery in which the chest is opened and surgery is done on the heart muscle, valves, coronary arteries, or other parts of the heart (such as the aorta). See also CABG.
Pacemaker – A surgically implanted electronic device that helps regulate the heartbeat.
PAD – Peripheral Artery Disease: A common circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the limbs, usually to the legs. Symptoms include leg pain when walking (called intermittent claudication).
PAF – Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Atrial fibrillation that lasts from a few seconds to days, then stops on its own. See also Atrial Fibrillation.
Palpitations – A noticeably rapid, strong, or irregular heartbeat due to agitation, exertion or illness.
Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation – An unusual heart arrhythmia of unknown origin, at one time believed to be associated with an unusual sensitivity to alcohol consumption.
PDA – patent ductus arteriosus: A persistent opening between two major blood vessels leading from the heart. The opening is called ductus arteriosus and is a normal part of a baby’s circulatory system before birth that usually closes shortly after birth. But when it remains open, it’s called a patent ductus arteriosus. If it’s small, it may never need treatment, but a large PDA left untreated can allow poorly oxygenated blood to flow in the wrong direction, weakening the heart muscle and causing heart failure or other complications.
Pericardium: two thin layers of a sac-like tissue that surround the heart, hold it in place and help it work.
PET – Positron Emission Tomography: A non-invasive scanning technique that uses small amounts of radioactive positrons (positively charged particles) to visualize body function and metabolism. In cardiology, PET scans are used to evaluate heart muscle function in patients with coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy.
PFO – Patent Forman Ovale: An opening between the left and right atria (the upper chambers) of the heart. Everyone has a PFO before birth, but in 1 out of every 3 or 4 people, the opening does not close naturally as it should after birth.
Plaque – A deposit of fatty (and other) substances in the inner lining of the artery wall; it is characteristic of atherosclerosis.
POTS – Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome: A disorder that causes an increased heart rate when a person stands upright.
PPCM – Post-partum cardiomyopathy: A form of cardiomyopathy that causes heart failure toward the end of pregnancy or in the months after delivery, in the absence of any other cause of heart failure.
Preeclampsia – a late-pregnancy complication identified by spikes in blood pressure, protein in the urine, possible vision problems. Women who experience pregnancy complications like preeclampsia are at significantly higher risk for heart disease.
Prinzmetal’s Variant Angina – Chest pain caused by a spasm in a coronary artery that supplies blood to the heart muscle.
PSVT – Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia: – An occasional rapid heart rate (150-250 beats per minute) that is caused by events triggered in areas above the heart’s lower chambers (the ventricles). “Paroxysmal” means from time to time. See also supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).
Pulmonary Valve: One of the four valves in the heart, located between the pulmonary artery and the right ventricle of the heart, moves blood toward the lungs and keeps it from sloshing back into the heart.
PV – Pulmonary Vein: A vein carrying oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium of the heart.
PVC – Premature Ventricular Contraction: An early or extra heartbeat that happens when the heart’s lower chambers (the ventricles) contract too soon, out of sequence with the normal heartbeat. In the absence of any underlying heart disease, PVCs do not generally indicate a problem with electrical stability, and are usually benign.
RA – Right Atrium: The right upper chamber of the heart. The right atrium receives de-oxygenated blood from the body through the vena cava and pumps it into the right ventricle which then sends it to the lungs to be oxygenated.
Radial Artery: the artery in the wrist where a thin catheter is inserted through the body’s network of arteries in the arm and eventually into the heart during a procedure to implant a stent. Doctors may also call this transradial access, the transradial approach, or transradial angioplasty. Because it’s associated with fewer complications, this is increasingly considered the default access approach in most countries, except in the U.S. where the traditional Femoral Artery (groin) approach is still the most popular access.
RBBB – Right Bundle Branch Block: A delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel to make your heart beat. The delay or blockage occurs on the pathway that sends electrical impulses to the right side of your heart. See also Left Bundle Branch Block.
RCA – Right Coronary Artery: An artery that supplies blood to the right side of the heart.
Restenosis – The re-closing or re-narrowing of an artery after an interventional procedure such as angioplasty or stent placement. Sometimes called “stent failure”.
RHD – Rheumatic Heart Disease: Permanent damage to the valves of the heart caused especially by repeated attacks of rheumatic fever.
RM – Right Main coronary artery: A blood vessel that supplies oxygenated blood to the walls of the heart’s ventricles and the right atrium.
RV – Right Ventricle: The lower right chamber of the heart that receives de-oxygenated blood from the right atrium and pumps it under low pressure into the lungs via the pulmonary artery.
SA – Sinus node: The “natural” pacemaker of the heart. The node is a group of specialized cells in the top of the right atrium which produces the electrical impulses that travel down to eventually reach the ventricular muscle, causing the heart to contract.
SB – Sinus Bradycardia: Abnormally slow heartbeat.
SBP – Systolic Blood Pressure: The highest blood pressure measured in the arteries. It occurs when the heart contracts with each heartbeat. Example: the first number in 120/80.
SCAD – Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection: A rare emergency condition that occurs when a tear forms in one of the blood vessels in the heart, causing a heart attack, abnormalities in heart rhythm and/or sudden death. SCAD tends to strike young healthy women with few if any cardiac risk factors.
SD – Septal defect: A hole in the wall of the heart separating the atria (two upper chambers of the heart) or in the wall of the heart separating the ventricles (two lower chambers).
Sestamibi stress test – See MIBI.
Short QT intervals (SQT): An abnormal heart rhythm where the heart muscle takes a shorter time to recharge between beats. It can cause a variety of complications from fainting and dizziness to sudden cardiac arrest.
Sick Sinus Syndrome (also known as sinus node dysfunction) is caused by an electrical problem in the heart; a group of related heart conditions that can affect how the heart beats, most commonly in older adults, although it can be diagnosed in people of any age. “Sick sinus” refers to the sinoatrial node (see below). In people with sick sinus syndrome, the SA node does not function normally.
Sinoatrial node (SA): also commonly called the sinus node; it’s a small bundle of neurons situated in the upper part of the wall of the right atrium (the right upper chamber of the heart). The heart’s electrical impulses are generated there. It’s the normal natural pacemaker of the heart and is responsible for the initiation of each heartbeat.
Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) – A rare emergency condition that occurs when a tear forms in one of the blood vessels in the heart, causing a heart attack, abnormalities in heart rhythm and/or sudden death. SCAD tends to strike young healthy women with few if any cardiac risk factors.
SSS – Sick Sinus Syndrome: The failure of the sinus node to regulate the heart’s rhythm.
ST – Sinus Tachycardia: A heart rhythm with elevated rate of impulses originating from the sinoatrial node, defined as greater than 100 beats per minute (bpm) in an average adult. The normal heart rate in the average adult ranges from 60–100 bpm. Also called sinus tach or sinus tachy.
Statins – Any of a class of drugs that lower the levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) – the ‘bad’ cholesterol in the blood – by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme involved in the production of cholesterol in the liver. Examples of brand name statins: Lipitor, Crestor, Zocor, Mevacor, Levachol, Lescol, etc. Also available as a cheaper generic form of the drug.
STEMI – ST-elevation heart attack (myocardial infarction). The more severe form of the two main types of heart attack. A STEMI produces a characteristic elevation in the ST segment on an electrocardiogram (EKG). The elevated ST segment is how this type of heart attack got its name. See also NSTEMI.
Stent – An implantable device made of expandable, metal mesh (looks a bit like a tiny chicken wire tube) that is placed (by using a balloon catheter) at the site of a narrowing coronary artery during an angioplasty procedure. The stent is then expanded when the balloon fills, the balloon is removed, and the stent is left in place to help keep the artery open. TRIVIA ALERT: the coronary stent was named after Charles Stent (1807-1885), an English dentist who invented a compound to produce dentures and other things like skin grafts and hollow tubes (essentially what a metal coronary stent is). His real claim to fame occurred when he suggested using his material to coat underwater trans-Atlantic cable, which had broken several times as a result of corrosion by seawater. You’re welcome.
Stint – a common spelling mistake when what you really mean is the word “stent” (see above).
Stress Echocardiography – A standard echocardiogram test that’s performed while the person exercises on a treadmill or stationary bicycle. This test can be used to visualize the motion of the heart’s walls and pumping action when the heart is stressed, possibly revealing a lack of blood flow that isn’t always apparent on other heart tests. The echocardiogram is performed just before and just after the exercise part of the procedure. See also TTE.
Sudden Cardiac Arrest – The stopping of the heartbeat, usually because of interference with the electrical signal (often associated with coronary heart disease). Can lead to Sudden Cardiac Death.
Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy – A heart condition that can mimic a heart attack. Sometimes called Broken Heart Syndrome, it is not a heart attack, but it feels just like one, with common symptoms like severe chest pain and shortness of breath. It sometimes follows a severe emotional stress. Over 90% of reported cases are in women ages 58 to 75. Also referred to as Broken Heart Syndrome, stress cardiomyopathy, stress-induced cardiomyopathy or apical ballooning syndrome.
TAVR – Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A minimally invasive procedure to repair a damaged or diseased aortic valve. A catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin and threaded to the heart. A balloon at the end of the catheter, with a replacement valve folded around it, delivers the new valve to take the place of the old. Also called TAVI (Transcatheter aortic valve implantation).
Tetralogy of Fallot – A rare condition caused by a combination of four heart defects that are present at birth, affecting the structure of the heart and causing oxygen-poor blood to flow out of the heart and into the rest of the body. Infants and children with Tetralogy of Fallot usually have blue-tinged skin because their blood doesn’t carry enough oxygen. Often diagnosed in infancy, but sometimes not until later in life depending on severity.
Tg – Triglycerides: The most common fatty substance found in the blood; normally stored as an energy source in fat tissue. High triglyceride levels may thicken the blood and make a person more susceptible to clot formation. High triglyceride levels tend to accompany high cholesterol levels and other risk factors for heart disease, such as obesity.
TIA – Transient Ischemic Attack: A stroke-like event that lasts only for a short time and is caused by a temporarily blocked blood vessel.
TEE – Transesophageal echocardiogram: This test involves an ultrasound transducer inserted down the throat into the esophagus in order to take clear images of the heart structures without the interference of the lungs and chest.
Treadmill Stress Test – See Exercise Stress Test.
troponin – a type of cardiac enzyme found in heart muscle, and released into the blood when there is damage to the heart (for example, during a heart attack). A positive blood test that shows elevated troponin is the preferred test for a suspected heart attack because it is more specific for heart injury than other blood tests, especially the newer high sensitivity troponin tests (hs-cTnT).
TTE – Transthoracic Echocardiogram: This is the standard echocardiogram, a painless test similar to X-ray, but without the radiation, using a hand-held device called a transducer placed on the chest to transmit high frequency sound waves (ultrasound). These sound waves bounce off the heart structures, producing images and sounds that can be used by the doctor to detect heart damage and disease.
TV – Tricuspid Valve: One of four one-way valves in the heart, a structure that controls blood flow from the heart’s upper right chamber (the right atrium) into the lower right chamber (the right ventricle).
UA or USA – Unstable Angina: Chest pain that occurs when diseased blood vessels restrict blood flow to the heart; symptoms are not relieved by rest; considered a dangerous and emergency crisis requiring immediate medical help.
Valves: Your heart has four one-way valves that keep blood flowing in the right direction. Blood enters the heart first through the tricuspid valve, and next goes through the pulmonary valve (sometimes called the pulmonic valve) on its way to the lungs. Then the blood returning from the lungs passes through the mitral (bicuspid) valve and leaves the heart through the aortic valve.
Vasodilator: A drug that causes dilation (widening) of blood vessels.
Vasospasm: A blood vessel spasm that causes sudden constriction, reducing its diameter and blood flow to the heart muscle. See also Prinzmetal’s Variant Angina.
VB – Ventricular Bigeminy: A heart rhythm condition in which the heart experiences two beats of the pulse in rapid succession.
Vena Cava – a large vein that carryies de-oxygenated blood into the heart. There are two in humans, the inferior vena cava (carrying blood from the lower body) and the superior vena cava (carrying blood from the head, arms, and upper body).
Ventricle – each of the two main chambers of the heart, left and right.
VF – Ventricular Fibrillation: A condition in which the ventricles (two lower chambers of the heart) contract in a rapid, unsynchronized fashion. When fibrillation occurs, the ventricles cannot pump blood throughout the body. Most sudden cardiac deaths are caused by VF or ventricular tachycardia (VT).
VLDL – Very Low Density Lipoprotein: Molecules made up of mostly triglycerides, cholesterol and proteins. VLDL, also known as the “very bad” cholesterol, carries cholesterol from the liver to organs and tissues in the body. It may lead to low density lipoproteins (LDL), associated with higher heart disease risks. VLDL levels are tricky to measure routinely, and are usually estimated as a percentage of your triglyceride levels. By reducing triglycerides, you are usually also reducing your VLDL levels.
Warfarin – A drug taken to prevent the blood from clotting and to treat blood clots. Warfarin is believed to reduce the risk of blood clots causing strokes or heart attacks. Also known as Coumadin.
Widowmaker heart attack – The type of heart attack I survived, since you asked. A nickname doctors use to describe a severely blocked left main coronary artery or proximal left anterior descending coronary artery of the heart. This term is used because if the artery gets abruptly and completely blocked, it can cause a massive heart attack that will likely lead to sudden cardiac death. Please note the gender imbalance here: despite the number of women like me who do experience this type of cardiac event, doctors are not calling this the widowermaker, after all.
WPW – Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome: A condition in which an extra electrical pathway connects the atria (two upper chambers) and the ventricles (two lower chambers). It may cause a rapid heartbeat.
NOTE FROM CAROLYN: I was very happy when we were able to include this entire glossary in my book, “A Woman’s Guide to Living with Heart Disease“ (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017).
Are we missing any important heart acronyms/terms from this list? Let me know!
Please can someone explain something for me. I am a 53 yr old woman and generally fit and healthy. Had 2 ECG’s due to a one off dizzy spell during a stressful time dealing with my fathers terminal diagnosis. The 2nd ECG request did give me concern as i did not know why i had to have one. On 24/01/19 at my doctors appointment she explained that on 3 the leads it showed inverted T waves. And she explained that it may suggest angina. I was so shocked. Wasn’t expecting that. She gave me a GNT (nitroglycerin) spray in case I do get pain and take 75Mg of aspirin. I’m now waiting for a Cardiology referral.
I am so stressed and consumed by what might be wrong. My maternal grandmother had angina and valve issues. Her 3 brothers all had double bypasses. Could I have inherited this? I am not overweight at 63kg and 5.ft 9. I walk 20-25 miles a week at work and general walking here and there. I started HRT (patches evorol 25 -50) in July as menopause pain was making me feel like I was 90 and was getting me down.
I am worried so much now and analysing every ache/ twinge I get. I feel like a hypochondriac at the moment. I’m worried what will happen at the cardiologist and what the test will entail and tell me. I am waiting on cholesterol test which I had on 25/01/19. Can I have inverted T waves and be fine. Please help I am so scared and crying far too much.
Hello Colleen – the first thing is: please take a big deep breath before you read another word here! I’m not a physician so of course cannot comment on your specific case, but I can tell you generally that the definition of “angina” (as this glossary lists above) is “distressing symptoms”, typically chest pain that gets worse with exertion, and goes away with rest. That’s classic stable angina… typically caused by something that’s reducing blood flow to the heart muscle (causing the chest pain of angina).
A family history that might make a difference for you personally is only in what’s called your ‘first degree’ relatives: for example, if your mother or sister were diagnosed with heart disease before age 65, or if your Dad or brother were diagnosed before age 55, then doctors would consider that you have a family history as a risk factor for heart disease. There’s little if any scientific evidence that a grandparent or uncle’s heart disease history has any effect on your own risk.
It is a very good thing that you’re having further tests and a referral to a cardiologist, if only to ease your mind. There are many reasons for inverted T-waves, ranging from cardiac issues to completely benign conditions. One way of looking at this is choosing to believe that seeing a cardiologist will ease your mind one way or the other – so this is something to look forward to, not dread. If the cardiologist spots something suspicious, a treatment plan will be created. If not, you can wave goodbye and go back to happily living your life.
Try thinking of this cardiology appointment just as you would if your car were making some frightening noises and you were bringing it to your mechanic for a check up. You could work yourself into a complete state worrying ahead of time if the car trouble is going to be serious, or you could look at this appointment as the solution – at last! – to figuring out what’s wrong so the mechanic can recommend the next step.
Thank you for this list of so many definitions provided in plain English. what a valuable resource this is. THANK YOU, I have been looking for translations FOR PATIENTS not med school graduates– like this for three years.
My family doctor had me wear a 24 hr EKG. After reading the results, she has scheduled a scope to look inside my heart by a specialist. Completely forgoing a stress test. Said I have major changes in the EKG, what type of changes could they be looking at? Had LAD STENT INSERTED 7 YRS AGO – WHAT COULD THEY BE LOOKING FOR?
This is a great wealth of information, Carolyn! I looked and did not see my diagnosis, which is aortic stenosis. I looked under aortic as well as stenosis. Did I just miss it somehow?
I learned some new information, I am a bit familiar now, but not when I had my MI, it was like learning a new language. But, my favorite part was seeing SCAD on this list! Thank you.
Thanks and welcome! I was thinking of editing that SCAD definition actually: I suspect that that it isn’t so much that SCAD is “rare”, but it’s more that it’s “rarely correctly diagnosed”.
I totally agree that SCAD is not as rare as I believed for many years. Once awareness is spread to all medical staff, I believe many lives will be saved. Hoping for a brighter future for all SCAD patients.
I hope so too, Cathy. Perhaps when more SCAD studies (like Mayo Clinic’s) are published and read by more and more MDs, it will no longer be “rarely correctly diagnosed”.
It’s great to see IST on here. I was diagnosed with it 9 years ago and the lack of awareness is frustrating.
What a great resource for heart patients and their families!
Thanks so much, Ashley. I recently updated my original 2011 list after the world-famous Cleveland Clinic tweeted their glossary recently and I noticed that their list had a few glaring omissions (like SCAD and Brugada Syndrome) so this made me wonder what my list might be missing, too. Let me know if there’s anything else you think should be included, okay?
How is your health these days? How are you feeling?
New for me too. I have just been diagnosed with A-HCM: Apical Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.
I’ll add that one to my list, Kathleen – thanks!
Just saw this, Carolyn, and you’ve compiled a great resource. One note on A-HCM: Present thinking is that it’s due to a genetic modification. Runs in families though sometimes occurs spontaneously. I have not as yet done genetic testing, though it’s been offered.
Thanks Kathleen – like many cardiac diagnoses, it sounds like a moving target… Good luck to you!
This list is great. I’ve just been diagnosed and am utterly overwhelmed. Even in the WomenHeart online support community, I often have no clue most days what others are talking about with all these initials about their heart tests and specific disease. This is VERY helpful, thank you SO MUCH. Love your website which has been a godsend since my diagnosis.",['Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) is a surgically implanted electronic device to treat life-threatening heartbeat irregularities.'],8925,multifieldqa_en,en,,2f73cf12085e3fb879c775fc4851b72092a060cad5a927c6," Heart disease has its own jargon, understandable only by other members of the club, particularly by cardiac care providers. Here’s a helpful list of some of the most common acronyms/terms you’ll likely find around the cardiac ward. This entire patient-friendly, jargon-free glossary (all 8,000 words!) is also part of my book “A Woman’S Guide to Living with Heart Disease“ (Johns Hopkins University Press, November 2017).

Aorta – The main artery of the body, carrying blood from the left side of the heart to the arteries of all limbs and organs except the lungs. Apical Pulse: A central pulse located at the apex (pointy bottom) of theHeart. Atrial Flutter – A heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia) originating from the right atrium, most often involving a large circuit that travels around the area of the tricuspid valve. Atrioventricular Nodal Re-entry Tachycardia: A heart. rhythm problem that happens when there’s an electrical short circuit in the centre of the. heart, one of the most common types of SVT, most commonly seen in people in their twenties and thirties, and more common in women. than in men. BNP – Blood pressure test – BNP (Briuretic Peptide-type) is a substance secreted from the ventricle or lower chambers of theheart that increases blood pressure. Includes one of these prescribed meds along with daily low-dose aspirin. The force or force of the blood pressure increases when the heart condition is stable, and worsens when the symptoms worsen. Brugada syndrome is a genetic heart disease characterized by distinctively abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG) findings and an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest. Coronary Artery Disease: A narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Cardiomyopathy – a chronic disease of the heart muscle (myocardium), in which the muscle is abnormally enlarged, thickened, and/or stiffened. Cardiac Tamponade – Pressure on the heart that occurs when blood or fluid builds up in the space between the myocardium and the outer covering sac of theHeart. Heart failure – a condition in which. the heart cannot pump all the blood returning to it, leading to a backup of blood in the. vessels and an accumulation of fluid in the body’s tissues, including the lungs and i.C.B. – Calcium Channel Blocker: A drug that lowers blood pressure by regulating calcium-related electrical activity in the heart, often associated with coronary heart disease. Cardioversion – a medical procedure in which an abnormally fast heart rate (tachycardia) or cardiac arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation is converted to a normal rhythm. Collateral arteries – Blood vessels that provide an alternative arterial supply of blood to an area of the heart that’s in danger of being deprived of oxygenated blood because of one or more blocked arteries. C-reactive protein – A byproduct of inflammation, produce by the liver, found in the blood in some cases of acute inflammation. Coumadin – A drug taken to prevent the blood from clotting and to treat blood clots. Costochondritis – the cause of severe chest pain, but NOT heart-related; it’re an inflammation of the cartilage that connects a rib to the breastbone.

It may cause a rapid heartbeat. Are we missing any important heart acronyms/terms from this list? Let me know!Please can someone explain something for me. Had 2 ECG’s due to a one off dizzy spell during a stressful time dealing with my fathers terminal diagnosis. The 2nd ECG request did give me concern as i did not know why i had to have one. On 24/01/19 at my doctors appointment she explained that on 3 the leads it showed inverted T waves. And she said it may suggest angina. I was so shocked. Wasn’t expecting that. She gave me a GNT (nitroglycerin) spray in case I do get pain and take 75Mg of aspirin. I’m now waiting for a Cardiology referral. I am so stressed and consumed by what might be wrong. My maternal grandmother had angina and valve issues. Her 3 brothers all had double bypasses. Could I have inherited this? I am not overweight at 63kg and 5.ft 9. I walk 20-25 miles a week at work and general walking here and there. I started HRT (patches evorol 25 -50) in July as menopause pain was making me feel like I was 90 and was getting me down. I feel like a hypochondriac at the moment. I'm worried what will happen at the cardiologist and what the test will entail and tell me. Can I have inverted T a 24 hr EKG. After reading the results, she has scheduled a scope to look inside my heart by a specialist. Completely forgoing a stress test. Said I have major changes in the EKGs, what type of changes could they be looking at? Had LAD STENT INSERTED 7 YRS AGO – WHAT COULD THEY BE LOOKING FOR? This is a great wealth of information, Carolyn! I looked and did not see my diagnosis, which is aortic stenosis. Did I just miss it somehow?I learned some new information, I am a bit familiar now, but not when I had my MI, it was like learning a new language. But, my favorite part was seeing SCAD on this list! Thank you. I recently updated my original 2011 list after the world-famous Cleveland Clinic tweeted their glossary recently and I noticed that their list had a few glaring omissions."
Why is it important for the sides of the fuselage to be sloped (tumbled home)?,"Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go ""perfectly."" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane.
This is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes.
While building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying ""banana"" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built.
First understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the ""projected"" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are ""foreshortened"" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to ""develop"" the ""true"" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat.
Second, understand that the dimensions called for in the plans put a twist in the sides that tends to work the panel in two directions of curvature. This twist makes the panel ""undevelopable"" meaning that that shape cannot be unrolled into an equivalent flat shape. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. To illustrate this, try forming a piece of paper around a soda can. The paper can be formed flat around the can either straight or at a diagonal to it's length. It has only one direction of curvature and is by definition ""developable"". Now try to form the same piece of paper around a baseball. It won't lie flat on the surface without some deformation (folding, wrinkling or tearing) of the paper. The ball has curvature in more that one direction and is a ""compounded"" shape. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain.
Initially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home), the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical shape firewall to tailstock.
This method borrows heavily from proven techniques used in the marine trades. It should be stressed at this point that although the layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time. If the layout is not going well initially, start over! Better to erase layout errors now than to have them built it and cause surprises later.
Layout to ensure a fair and true fuselage starts by drawing a reference line (baseline) on the building surface. Refer to figures 2 & 3 and use a wire guide to draw a very straight baseline. About 500 lbs. Of tension should be adequate. One could use a chalk line, but we're talking airplanes here, not house framing.
The main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Although the baseline will still be the reference, the top and bottom longerons will be laid separately.
Layout differences don't end there. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. Another major difference is that the bottom & side panels are applied after forming the fuselage box section. This is mainly to obtain the ability to ""fair"" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape.
Refer to figure 1 for the layout of the new developed side panel. The firewall (station a) is layed out perpendicular to the baseline. Longitudinal (station) measurements are given along the length of the baseline from the firewall. Vertical dimensions are given to reference the angle and breadths of the station at the baseline.
Notice that the top longeron is bowed outward and that the stations are spaced slightly greater than called out in the plans. When the panels are formed into the box frame section ,they will work into the dimensions specified in the plans.
Strike a centerline, longer than is needed on the building surface using a wire guide. Draw off the firewall line perpendicular to the centerline at one end.
Using the distances listed in the balloons, mark them off on the centerline. Distances are measured to the nearest sixteenth of an inch. Take time to mark them off carefully. Don't mark off the distances in a cumulative fashion. Use the firewall as a common reference.
Using the angles listed at each station, mark off a station line longer than is needed. The angles are measured to the nearest hundredth of a degree. Take time to mark them off carefully.
At each station, start by marking off each short (bottom longeron) line distance from the centerline. Use your set of trammels or beam compass for doing this. Mark the intersection of the short line with the station line.
At each station, mark off each long (top longeron) line distance from the intersection of the short line distance and the station line. Again the trammels or beam compass is best for completing this step. Mark the intersection of the long line distance with the station line.
Using the longeron as a batten, trace out the inside and outside curves of the longeron. After the batten is secure, in between each station, fasten a keeper block inside and outside to preserve the shape of the longeron taking care to avoid potential future interference with the diagonal members to be installed later. The fairing blocks can be removed or left in place if they won't interfere with building. The vertical station members and their diagonals can now be measured and positioned. Remember to refer to the plans for the material thickness direction.
After vertical and diagonal members are cut and fitted, take time to draw their outlines on the building surface to cut down on time and confusion when laying out the opposite side.
Finishing the side panel is accomplished in a manner similar to that called for in the handbook with the exception that the side and bottom skin panels will be attached later.
The next article in the series will discuss jigging and building techniques to ensure alignment and straightness of the flat built side panels. Also covered will be building a ""strongback"" jig to assure alignment of the side panels when they are formed into their final shape.
Part 3 in the series will cover assembly of the side panels using the jigs. Some joint details will be discussed that will ensure a stronger and more fair fuselage assembly. Also covered will be the layout & attachment of the side and bottom ply skins.

""Scarfing"" is the practice of splicing plywood so that short pieces of plywood can be used to span long distances. On the KR, it is required on both the fuselage skins and spar webs. The angle of the splice should be 10 to 12 degrees to maintain strength across the joint. Also, joints should coincide with structural members, such as spar webs or fuselage truss members.
This scarfer is made by mating a regular plunge router (this one costs about $50) to a table saw. Obviously, you really only need a table saw to cut the chamfer, but it does make a nice heavy table for scarfing. You could just as easily use a large work table as the base.First, set the table saw for a 5.5 degree cut (for a 1:12 joint, or 6.5 degree cut for a 10:1 joint), and run a 1 x 6 through on edge to chamfer a corner on the board. Then drill the board for three router mounting holes (two are countersunk) and connect the assembly to the table saw with two 1/4 inch bolts. Use a long (2-3 inch) straight cutting bit to do the cutting. Adjust the bit so it doesn't interfere with your table top, and go to town. Keep pressure on the plywood to ensure contact with the table while you're scarfing. Make sure you feed your material from the same end as you would if you were sawing, or the router will take your plywood away from you and put a big dent in your garage door.
In the late 60's Ken Rand and Stuart Robinson were working as flight system engineers for Douglas Avionics. Ken was working as an electrical engineer, having previously worked for Sperry as an autopilots project engineer, while Stu's degree was in aeronautical engineering from Northrop University. They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer.
They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport.
Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79.
To date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2"" between firewall and main spar, and 14"" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts.
Mike Stearns addresses the KR Forum crowd.
This year's KR Forum featured guest speakers Mike Stearns, Steve Trentman, and Bill Marcey. Mike Stearns spoke on several topics, including the many sources for KR and homebuilding information available on the Internet. He also mentioned KRNet, the list server devoted entirely to KR aircraft, as well as several notable World Wide Web home pages. He also brought a sample of the new Rand Robinson wing skins with him, and discussed their high temperature core prepreg construction. His KR2S will receive the first set, which is currently being installed at Hinson Composites.
Steve Trentman spoke on his turbine installation. It uses a turbine engine which saw duty as an A7 attack jet starter engine. Total weight is about 85 pounds, while putting out around 90 horsepower. There is a small stockpile of these engines available from government surplus. sources. This engine can only be throttled back to 52% power, which leads to some pretty interesting landings. One inflight failure has been logged so far, with very little damage to the aircraft. More on this exciting development in next month's issue of KROnline.
Les Palmer's KR2 N202LP won Best KR2, Best Engine Installation, and People's Choice awards at the 1995 KR Gathering at Columbia, TN. After researching the KR series, and reading Neil Bingham's ""A Critical Analysis of the KR2"" (Jan 88 Sport Aviation), Les decided to build his as a single seater, stretched 24"" in the tail, while maintaining a stock width firewall. His fuselage is made from Douglas fir, which weighs in at 4 lbs heavier than if constructed from spruce. It is skinned with 1/8"" birch plywood. Spars are covered with plywoood on both fore and aft sides, ala KR2S. Diehl wing skins provide the lift. Horizontal stabilizer and elevator were stretched 7"" longer on each side, while the vertical stabilizer and rudder were stretched 8"" taller. . The fuselage to cowling junction was made more graceful by adding 1.5 inches to the height of the firewall end of the fuselage sides.
Les's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. The canopy frame fits snugly into a recess in the foward deck, providing an excellent wind and water seal. The fiberglass work is exemplary.
Seating is luxurious for one.
The cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. Female molds were made for all the fiberglass parts on Les's plane, so he could proabably be persuaded to make more, if demand dictates. Les also machines a multitude of KR aluminum and steel parts which he now offers for sale.
The firewall was reinforced with aluminum brackets and angles bolted between the longerons in anticipation of the 200 lb Subaru EA-81 engine installation. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Other than tapping the crank for larger bolts to mount the redrive, no other engine modifications were required. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy.
Originally built as a taildragger, the fixed gear is made from 4130 steel tubing. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6"" Cleveland calipers for braking. An early taxi test accident damaged the main gear, and prompted Les to change to tricycle gear. Again, he designed his own fiberglass main gear, and uses a Diehl nose wheel fork with a 4130 strut and 6"" wheel up front.
Early tests revealed cooling problems, which prompted a radiator move from the firewall to a lower cowling location.
The first flight was almost a disaster, as test pilot Randy Smith lost power right after takeoff. He managed a 180 with a safe downwind landing with only minor nosewheel pant damage. The culprit proved to be a spark plug with too much reach, which was quickly remedied. Subsequent flights have shown water temp to be about 210 degrees, oil temp is 220-230, and airspeed is about 180 mph.
Shopping for the Partially Built KR.
This story starts about twenty years ago when I first started looking at the KR-2 as the plane I'd like to build. The only problem at that time was a lack of money, lack of knowledge, and a lack of job stability. I liked the design, except for the low ground clearance of the retractable gear and that a KR was going to be a tight fit for me to fly.
Over the past twenty years I've owned a number of planes, but still always wanted to build my own. I needed one that would fit me, my budget requirements, and have the speed and performance that I wanted. When ""KITPLANES"" published the article featuring Roy Marsh's new KR-2S, it was the first I had heard of any major modifications or improvements to the same old KR design. I believe that article and Roy Marsh's workmanship have probably been the greatest boon to Rand Robinson (RR) in the last twenty years. It certainly caught my eye! Here was the same design I had decided I wanted to build twenty years ago, with all of the improvements I wanted. It was sitting on fixed gear with some reasonable ground clearance. It had the capability to be built large enough to accommodate me. It has enough prefab parts available that it didn't have to be 100% scratch built if I decided to hurry the project along. And it had the speed I wanted. I knew that Roy's published speeds were probably not realistic expectations for the average KR, but after knocking around for the last three years in my Champ, anything over 90 mph seems pretty fast to me.
After purchasing the info kit and the sales video from Rand Robinson, the next step after deciding for sure to build this plane was to order the KR-2 plans and the KR-2S addendum. I finally got my plans and was putting together my first order to start the plane, when my partner in the Champ pointed out that there was a partially completed KR-2S for sale in Trade-a-plane. My initial answer was ""No, I don't even want to look at it. I want to build my own from scratch."" My partner insisted that for the advertised price and the fact that it wasn't too far away, I ought to at least give the guy a call and investigate it. ""No, I don't think I want to buy someone else's problems,"" I persisted. That night I went home and crunched up some numbers on the calculator and finally came to the conclusion that for the sake of my budget for the next several years, I really should give this guy a call.
Three days later, I flew to his place about 400 miles away to take a look at his project. At this point I should probably mention that I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable about airplane construction, although the vast majority of my experience is with tube and fabric. The rest of this article deals with what I looked for and more importantly what I missed and have had to repair in the last year since I purchased the project.
When we went to the seller's house, I found that the left wing was built using the Dan Diehl wing skins and the right wing skins were leaning against the wall inside the house. Also the canopy was in the house with the canopy covered with paper and tape. I wanted to inspect the fuselage first, so off we went to the shop.
There I found a fuselage sitting on it's gear painted in primer gray. The first step was to inspect the quality of workmanship of what could be seen as it sat. The interior of the fuselage looked as if it had been built with a great deal of care. The fit and finish of all of the interior wood was very nice. Even the gussets looked like they had been painstakingly perfectly fitted. The glass work on the turtle back also looked very precise and clean. It was evenly faired into the vertical and horizontal stabs. The tail also appeared to be well built with the exception of a depression directly over the front and rear spars in the horizontal stabs. He explained that when he moved recently, that he had shot the plane with gray primer to protect it from the weather since he wouldn't have ready access to a shop to put it in right away. It ended up sitting out in the hot south Texas summer sun for a few weeks before he got a shop rented to work in. That caused the glass (or possibly the foam inside the horizontal stab) to swell, except that it held onto the spar, so it was slightly ballooned in front of and behind the spars. His recommendation was to fill it back smooth with micro.
I also found a small linear crack in the lower left wing spar cap on the left wing stub. It appeared to be from over tightening the rear spar wing attach fitting bolts. His explanation was that the crack wasn't important because the rear spars only job is to keep the wings from folding back. I also noticed that the holes for attaching the outer wing to the wing stub were badly rounded out on the rear spar. He explained that the Diehl wing skins require the rear spar to be swept slightly more forward than the stock wings. This won't allow you to use the rear spar attach fittings from RR and that I would need to fabricate a new set of rear spar attach fittings.
I also found that the aileron bellcranks were not built or installed as per plans, but found that they looked professional. I couldn't check for function since the right bellcrank and sheeve wasn't installed, the left wing also wasn't installed, and the right wing didn't exist yet.
Next we pulled the inspection panels off of the fuselage and tail and looked at everything I could see with a good flashlight. I didn't find anything else that might be questionable about the fuselage except for a cracked elevator trim tab that was damaged when it fell off it's hanging place on the wall.
Next we spent some time going over his builders log and builders photo album. I still hadn't seen anything that would dissuade me from buying this project.
At this point it was starting to get late and my ride down needed to get airborne for the flight home. I needed to make a decision about whether I wanted this project or not, but I hadn't inspected the wings and canopy yet. I took a cursory look at the left wing and saw lots on micro built up on it and some bubbles in the leading edge, but nothing that looked seriously wrong to my amateur eye. The right wing was only a set of spars in the shop and the Diehl wing skins in the house, so there wasn't much to look at there. The canopy was wrapped in paper and tape, so there wasn't much to look at there either. I decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the project. For the advertised price, I could build a new set of wings and still be way ahead financially. We negotiated a final price, shook hands, took my ride to the airport, and started off in search of a U-haul to haul the project home.
Now, at this point, some of you are thinking about what I surely must have forgotten to inspect and why didn't I take a local A & P or EAA member along for the ride. First of all, I don't know any mechanics locally that have any experience with glass and our EAA chapter of which I am VP is woefully lacking in fiberglass knowledge. Secondly, as you will see, I missed plenty. Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough.
Now for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with.
I found that the lower set of rear spar attach fittings on the left rear spar were installed backwards with the longer spaced hole towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Also in the same area he had drilled through the rear spar with a hole saw to create a place for the aileron cable to pass through and managed to cut out the second from the outside vertical brace in the spar. Then he chose to install the aileron bellcranks in front of the rear spar, and cut another hole through the rear spar for the aileron push rod. He also managed to cut out the outside vertical brace in the spar. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in, cut the whole rear spar carrythrough out of the fuselage including ruining the left lower wing skin, or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap and install a custom built set of attach fittings.
I also found that after I built and installed the right side wing stub ribs and skin that the aileron bellcrank setup would not work as installed. The cable that crosses between the two bellcranks had a sharp uphill from the sheeve to the bellcrank in the last 12 inches on either side. This combined with the radius that the bellcranks turn caused the cross cable to pull up tight when the ailerons were pushed to either end of their travel, but allowed the cables to go very slack when the ailerons were centered. Also the Aileron pushrods needed to pass directly through the lower set of rear wing attach fittings to attach to the aileron. This whole rear spar and aileron bellcrank setup was going to either have to be redesigned or cut out and built to plans. The bottom line is that the problems I observed when I inspected this part were much more serious than expected when I had to fix it.
I decided that I had to remove the rear fittings from the left wing to be replaced with the new set that my neighborhood machinist was cutting out for me. When I put the wing on the work bench to start removing the rear fittings, I thought I had better take a closer look at the bubbles in the leading edge. I found that as I pushed on the leading edge, it delaminated between the glass lay-up on top and the upper and lower wing skin edges that were floxed together underneath. I concluded that that area had to come apart and took a belt sander to the leading edge. What I found was that the leading edge had been floxed together and glassed over, but the mold release had never been scrubbed off the leading edge of the wing. It peeled apart for rebuild quite easily.
When I got back to removing the rear spar attach fittings, I noticed that the woodwork inside the wing looked awfully dull. The reason was that the wing had been closed up without varnishing any of the woodwork. This was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer.
I also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. The tapered pipe threads were tapered the wrong way to install the draincock into the tank. Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem.
When I finally got around to attaching the wing to the fuselage, I found that the front spar attach fittings were badly misaligned. Although they could be forced into alignment, I didn't think I needed that kind of preload on the main spar fittings. This problem was fixed by calling on my local neighborhood machinist to build me an aligning fixture and reaming the attach holes to the next larger size and ordering the new sized bolts.
On the fuselage I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. I must complement the manufacturers for taking care of that problem. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels and brakes even though the receipt for this set was over four years old and in the original builders name. Their only concern was that this set had never been placed in service yet.
I chose to sand the load of micro off the left wing to see what it was covering. When I got down to the glass, I found that there was no glass for the aft inch and a half of the underside of the wing in front of the aileron hinge. With the Diehl wing skins, you build the wings, then cut the ailerons out of trailing edge of the wing. He had mismeasured and cut too much material off the bottom side of the trailing edge in front of the aileron. It was filled by floxing a piece of spruce into the gap to fill the space between the back edge of the fiberglass and the aileron mount. I chose to wrap the trailing edge of that wing, and the other wing to match with a couple of lay-ups of glass.
When I sanded the primer off the aforementioned damaged trim tab, I found that the hinge was floxed to the leading edge of the foam insides of the tab, but not the glass. I also chose to wrap the front of the trim tab with a lay-up of glass.
I decided to pull the paper off the canopy and take a look at it before I'm ready to bolt it on and fly. The original builder had blown his own canopy and after some of the previous problems, I was beginning to have some concerns about not having looked it over closely enough. The canopy turned out to have been blow a little too large. It ended up with a little larger bubble for headroom, which I didn't object to. However, it had more headroom on the right side than the left. Yes, it was just a little bit lopsided. The main problem was that the canopy is stretched thin enough that it can be easily pushed in with one hand when the weather is warm.. My fear was that this is just thin enough that it may decide to lay on my head or in my lap when flying on a warm day. It will have to be replaced.
I'm sure that many that are reading this could see several of the potential problems before I mentioned them, but some others may not have and I'm sure that there could have been many other problems that didn't but could have existed on this project. This is also not intended to be critical of the gentleman that started this project as many parts of it, especially the wood work are better than I could have done and much of his work is outstanding. I prefer to think that I'll end up with a better plane with his woodwork combined with my glasswork. This article is intended to feature some of the problems that you may run into in buying someone else's project.
The final question is, knowing what I have found over the past year, would I have still purchased this project. The answer is yes, but primarily because the price was right in that I am still money and work ahead of where I would be if I had started the project from scratch. There are a few things that I would have done differently, but nothing that I can't live with. Although I won't be able to say that I built it all from scratch, I have built and rebuild enough of the plane that I should have no problem qualifying under the 51% rule.

Here is an brief explanation of how I built my turtledecks. The jig was constructed from scrap plywood and a few 1x4s that I ripped into stringers. I made two temporary bulkheads from the plywood, one for each end. Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo.
After the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade.
After the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads. When the flox cured the bondo joints were broken, again being careful not to harm the wood. The turtledeck was removed from the fuselage and 2 inch tapes added to the bulkheads inside and out.
At this point the turtledeck looked great and only weighed about 5lbs. but I noticed you could deform the skin by pushing hard on the outside. So I flipped the turtledeck over and from 1/4 inch last-a-foam, I cut two inch wide strips that would run the entire length, forward and aft inside the turtledeck. In effect these would act as composite stringers, I made enough of these two inch wide strips to make up three stringers. One down the center (sort of a backbone) and one on each side of the ""backbone"" half the distance to the edge of the turtledeck. I sanded the edge of the foam so that when covered with a layer of bid @ 45degrees there would be a nice transition from the turtledeck skin up onto the foam and then back onto the turtledeck I scuff sanded and glued the foam stringers in with micro. I covered the foam stringers with one layer of 8oz bid @ 45degrees.",['The sides of the fuselage are sloped to create a conical section when the fuselage is formed.'],6250,multifieldqa_en,en,,41e27260a12cc40a778f8c1ba8bf643ee655871a458e5e1c," This is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 &KR-2 series planes. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built. The problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are ""foreshortened"" and don't give the proper shape. What needs to be done is to ""develop"" the ""true"" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in plane strain. The main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. This is mainly to obtain the ability to ""fair"" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape. The next article in the series will discuss jigging and building techniques to ensure alignment and strai. The layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time.

To date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5KR2Ss now in the air. KR2 builders tend to be innovative, which leads to interesting mods that the KR2 has. The KR2 is a case in point: Many who'd heard of the pitch and tightness of the cabin of theKR2 began to modify the plans to suit their needs. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport. Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident.  KR Forum featured guest speakers Mike Stearns, Steve Trentman, and Bill Marcey. Les Palmer's KR2 N202LP won Best KR2, Best Engine Installation, and People's Choice awards at the 1995 KR Gathering at Columbia, TN. The KR2 is stretched 2"" between firewall and main spar, and 14"" behind the main spar. The fuselage is made from Douglas fir, which weighs in at 4 lbs heavier than if constructed from spruce. Les's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy Hegy. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6"" Cleveland calipers for braking. The cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. The KR-2S was designed by Rand Robinson in the 1980s. The plane was designed to fly at speeds of up to 180 mph. It was designed with low ground clearance and a large fuselage. It has been partially built by a team of four people. The project has been in the works for more than 20 years and is still in the planning stages. It is not yet clear if the plane will ever be fully built by Robinsons' team.

CNN.com's John Sutter sat down with a group of friends to try to find a way to get to the top of the list. Sutter started out by looking at the glass work on the turtle back. He found that the aileron bellcranks were not built or installed as per plans, but found that they looked professional. He decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the new set of wings and still be way ahead of the rest of the group. Now for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with that I didn't know any of the people at the center of the story about. The top 10 list: ""Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough. Some by ignorance and some by not looking very close enough."" The bottom 10 list includes: ""I found a small linear crack in the lower left wing cap on the left wing stub,"" and ""I didn't find anything else that might be questionable about the right-side of the wall"" Le towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in. Or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap. Also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem. I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels andbrakes even though the set for this set was four years old and in the original builders name. Their only receipt was over receipt was a receipt for the set that was over four yearsold and in their co-owner's name. The problem was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer. This article is intended to feature some of the problems that you may run into in buying someone else's project. The canopy turned out to have been blow a little too large.

In effect these would act as composite stringers."
What is the effect of the proximity of superconductivity on the Kondo effect?,"\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro}

The exchange interactions control the magnetic order and properties of a vast number of materials
\cite{White2006Dec}
and lead to many fascinating phenomena, such as various types of the Kondo effect 
\cite{Kondo,NozieresBlandin,Pustilnik_Glazman}.
Double quantum dots (DQDs), and in general multi-impurity systems, constitute
a convenient and controllable playground,
where nearly as much different exchange mechanisms compete with each other to
shape the ground state of the system.
\emph{Local exchange} between the spin of a quantum dot (QD)
and the spin of conduction band electrons gives rise to the
Kondo effect \cite{Kondo,Hewson_book}. 
\emph{Direct exchange} arriving with an additional side-coupled QD may destroy it or lead to the 
two-stage Kondo screening \cite{Pustilnik_Glazman,Cornaglia,Granger,ZitkoBonca,ZitkoPRB2010,Ferreira}.
In a geometry where the two QDs contact the same lead, conduction band electrons 
mediate the \emph{RKKY exchange} \cite{RK,K,Y}. The RKKY interaction competes
with the Kondo effect and leads to the quantum phase transition of a still debated nature
\cite{Doniach,Jones,Affleck,Bork,Neel,KondoRKKYexp,Hans,Hans2,Fabian}.
Moreover, in DQDs coupled in series also \emph{superexchange} can alter the Kondo physics significantly
\cite{Zitko_2QDEx,Sela}.

Recently, hybrid quantum devices, in which the interplay between various magnetic correlations
with superconductivity (SC) plays an important role, have become an important direction of research
\cite{hybridQDs,SCspintronics}. In particular, chains of magnetic atoms on SC surface have proven 
to contain self-organized Majorana quasi-particles and exotic spin textures
\cite{Braunecker,Klinovaja,Vazifeh,Yazdani},
while hybrid DQD structures have been used to split the Cooper pairs coherently into two entangled 
electrons propagating to separated normal leads \cite{CPS1,CPS2,CPS4,CPS5,CPS9}.
The latter is possible due to non-local (\emph{crossed}) Andreev reflections (CARs),
in which each electron of a Cooper pair tunnels into different QD, and
subsequently to attached lead. Such processes give rise to an exchange mechanism \cite{Yao},
that we henceforth refer to as \emph{the CAR exchange}, which can greatly modify
the low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures.

The CAR exchange may be seen as RKKY-like interaction between
two nearby impurities on SC surface \cite{Yao}.
The effect can be understood as a consequence
of spin-dependent hybridization of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR)
states \cite{Yu,Shiba,Rusinov} in SC contact,
caused both by the overlap of their wave functions
and their coupling to Cooper-pair condensate.
This process is the most effective when the YSR states 
are close to the middle of the SC gap, {\it e.g.} in the YSR-screened phase \cite{YSRscreening}.
The mechanism presented here is essentially the same,
yet in the considered regime can be understood
perturbatively without referring to YSR states,
as a consequence of the non-local pairing induced by SC electrode. 
In particular, the presence of YSR bound states close to the Fermi level 
is not necessary for significant consequences for the Kondo physics, 
as long as some inter-dot pairing is present. 


The proximity of SC induces pairing in QDs \cite{RozhkovArovas,Buitelaar} 
and tends to suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap $2\Delta$ 
becomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature $T_K$ 
\cite{Buitelaar2002Dec,adatomsSC,Kondo_vs_SC1,Kondo_vs_SC2,Zitko_Kondo-Andreev,Zitko_S-QD-N,IW_Sau,YSRscreening}.
Moreover, the strength of SC pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics in the sub-gap transport regime:
For QDs attached to SC and normal contacts, it can enhance the Kondo effect
\cite{DomanskiIW,KWIW,part1}, while
for DQD-based Cooper pair splitters, it tends to suppress both the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Kondo effects \cite{IW_Kacper}.
Our main result is that the non-local pairing induced by superconducting 
proximity effect, which gives rise to CAR exchange, can be the sole cause of the Kondo screening.
Moreover, relatively small values of coupling to SC, $\GS{}\ll U$, are sufficient for the effect to occur.
This is in contrast to the DQD system considered in Ref.~\cite{part1},
where only one of the quantum dots is proximized, such that 
CAR exchange cannot arise,
and the Kondo physics becomes qualitatively
affected only for $\GS{}\sim U/2$.%

In this paper we discuss the CAR-induced Kondo screening in a setup comprising T-shaped DQD
with normal and superconducting contacts, see \fig{system}(a).
We note that despite quite generic character of CAR exchange,
and its presence in systems containing at least two localized electrons
coupled close to each other to the same SC bath,
to best of our knowledge CAR-induced screening
has hardly been identified in previous studies
\cite{CPS1,CPS2,CPS4,CPS5,CPS9,IW_Kacper,IW_Sau,Zitko_Josephson,Zitko_S2QD,Martinek2017}.
In the system proposed here [\fig{system}(a)], its presence is evident.
Moreover, CAR exchange magnitude can be directly related to the relevant energy scales, such as the Kondo 
temperature, which provides a fingerprint for quantitative experimental verification of our predictions. 

The paper is organized as follows. In \Sec{model} we describe the considered system 
and present the model we use to study it. In \Sec{scales} the relevant energy scales are estimated
to make the discussion of main results concerning CAR-induced Kondo effect in \Sec{main} more clear. 
Finally, the influence of effects neglected in \Sec{main} are presented in the following sections,
including CAR exchange interplay with RKKY interaction (\Sec{RKKY}), particle-hole asymmetry (\Sec{asym}),
couplings asymmetry (\Sec{x}) and reduced efficiency of CAR coupling (\Sec{coef}). In summary,
the effects discussed in \Sec{main} remain qualitatively valid in all these cases.
The paper is concluded in \Sec{conclusions}.


\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}

The schematic of the considered system is depicted in \fig{system}(a).
It contains two QDs attached to a common SC lead.
Only one of them (QD1) is directly attached to the left (L) and right (R) normal leads,
while the other dot (QD2) remains coupled only through QD1.
The SC is modeled by the BCS Hamiltonian, 
$H_{\mathrm{S}}=\sum_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}\xi_{\mathbf{k}}a_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}^{\dag}a_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}-\Delta\sum_{\mathbf{k}}(a^\dag_{\mathbf{k}\uparrow}a_{-\mathbf{k}\downarrow}^{\dag}+a_{-\mathbf{k}\downarrow}a_{\mathbf{k}\uparrow})$,
with energy dispersion $\xi_{\mathbf{k}}$, energy gap $2\Delta>0$ and $a_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}$ annihilation operator 
of electron possessing spin $\sigma$ and momentum $\mathbf{k}$. The coupling between
SC and QDs is described by the hopping Hamiltonian 
$H_{\mathrm{TS}}=\sum_{i\mathbf{k}\sigma}v_{\mathrm{S}i}(d^\dagger_{i\sigma}a^{}_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}+h.c.)$,
with $d^\dagger_{i\sigma}$ creating a spin-$\sigma$ electron at QD$i$. The matrix element 
$v_{\mathrm{S}i}$ and the normalized density of states of SC in normal state, $\rho_{\rm S}$, 
contribute to the coupling of QD$i$ to SC electrode as $\GS{i} = \pi \rho_{\rm S} |v_{{\rm S}i}|^2$. 
We focus on the sub-gap regime, therefore, we integrate out SC degrees of freedom lying outside the energy gap \cite{RozhkovArovas}.
This gives rise to the following effective Hamiltonian,
$H_{\mathrm{eff}}=H_{\mathrm{SDQD}}+H_{\rm L}+H_{\rm R}+H_{\rm T}$, 
where 
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{\rm SDQD} 	& = & 
				\sum_{i\sigma} \varepsilon_{i} n_{i\sigma} 
				+\sum_{i} U n_{i\uparrow} n_{i\downarrow} 
				+U' (n_1-1)(n_2-1) 
				\nonumber\\
				&+&\sum_\sigma t(d^\dagger_{1\sigma}d^{}_{2\sigma} + h.c.) 
				+J \vec{S}_1\vec{S}_2
				\nonumber\\
				&+&\sum_{i} \!\!\left[ \Gamma_{{\rm S}i} (d^\dagger_{i\uparrow} d^\dagger_{i\downarrow} \!+\! h.c.)
				+\Gamma_{\rm SX} (d^\dagger_{i\uparrow} d^\dagger_{\bar{i}\downarrow} \!+\! h.c.) \right]
	\label{H_DQD} 
\end{eqnarray}
is the Hamiltonian of the SC-proximized DQD
\cite{IW_Kacper,Walldorf2018Feb}, with QD$i$ energy level $\varepsilon_i$,
inter-site (intra-site) Coulomb interactions $U'$ ($U$),
inter-dot hopping $t$, and CAR coupling $\GS{\rm X}$.
$n_{i\sigma}=d^\dagger_{i\sigma}d^{}_{i\sigma}$ denotes the electron number operator 
at QD$i$, $n_i=n_\uparrow+n_\downarrow$, and $\bar{i}\equiv 3-i$. 
Our model is strictly valid in the regime where $\Delta$ is the largest 
energy scale. Nevertheless, all discussed phenomena are
present in a full model for energies smaller than SC gap.
Moreover, by eliminating other consequences of the presence of SC lead,
our model pinpoints the fact that the non-local pairing is 
sufficient for the occurrence of the CAR exchange.
The presence of out-gap states shall result mainly in additional broadening of DQD energy levels,
changing the relevant Kondo temperatures.
We note that the procedure of integrating out out-gap states neglects the 
RKKY interaction mediated by SC lead and other possible indirect exchange mechanisms%
 \footnote{
 Note, that by RKKY interaction we mean only such an effective exchange, 
 which arises due to multiple scattering of a single electron or hole, see \fig{system}(h)-(j).
 Other mechanisms leading to the total indirect exchange are considered separately.
 In particular, in the large gap limit, exchange described in Ref.~\cite{Yao} is in fact reduced to
 the CAR exchange, and additional antiferromagnetic contribution would arise for finite gap.
 }. 
To compensate for this,
we explicitly include the Heisenberg term $ J \vec{S}_1\vec{S}_2$ in
$H_{\rm SDQD}$, with $\vec{S}_i$ denoting the spin operator of QD$i$
and a Heisenberg coupling $J$ substituting the genuine RKKY exchange.

The normal leads are treated as reservoirs of noninteracting electrons,
$H_{r}=\sum_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}\varepsilon_{r\mathbf{k}}c^\dagger_{r\mathbf{k}\sigma}c^{}_{r\mathbf{k}\sigma}$,
where $c^{}_{r\mathbf{k}\sigma}$ annihilates an electron of spin 
$\sigma$ and momentum $\mathbf{k}$ in lead $r$ ($r={\rm L,R}$) with the corresponding energy $\varepsilon_{r\mathbf{k}\sigma}$.
The tunneling Hamiltonian reads,
$H_{\rm T} = \sum_{r\mathbf{k}\sigma} v_{r} (d^\dagger_{1\sigma}c^{}_{r\mathbf{k}\sigma} + h.c.)$,
giving rise to coupling between lead $r$ and QD$i$ of strength $\Gamma_r = \pi \rho_r |v_r|^2$,
with $\rho_r$ the normalized density of states of lead $r$ and $v_r$ the 
local hopping matrix element, assumed momentum-independent.
We consider a wide-band limit, assuming constant $\Gamma_r=\Gamma/2$
within the cutoff $\pm D = \pm 2U$ around the Fermi level. 

For thorough analysis of the CAR exchange mechanism and its consequences
for transport, we determine the linear conductance between the two normal leads from
\begin{equation}
G = \frac{2e^2}{h} \pi \Gamma \int \left[ -\frac{\partial f_T}{\partial\omega} \right] \mathcal{A}(\omega) {\rm d} \omega ,
\label{G}
\end{equation}
where $f_T$ is the Fermi function at temperature $T$,
while $\mathcal{A}(\omega)$ denotes the normalized local spectral density 
of QD1 \cite{fn1}.
Henceforth, unless we state otherwise, we assume a maximal CAR coupling, 
$\GS{\rm X} = \sqrt{\GS{1}\GS{2}}$ \cite{IW_Kacper,Walldorf2018Feb},
$\GS{1}=\GS{2}=\GS{}$ and consider DQD tuned to the particle-hole symmetry point, 
$\varepsilon_1=\varepsilon_2=-U/2$. However, these assumptions are not crucial for the results presented
here, as discussed in Secs.~\ref{sec:asym}-\ref{sec:coef}.

\section{Estimation of relevant energy scales}
\label{sec:scales}

Since we analyze a relatively complex system, let us build up the understanding of its behavior starting
from the case of a QD between two normal-metallic leads, which can be obtained in our 
model by setting $t=\GS{}=J=U'=0$. Then, the conductance as a function of temperature, $G(T)$, grows
below the Kondo temperature $T_K$ and reaches maximum for $T\to 0$, $G(T\!=\!0)=G_{\rm max}$.
At particle-hole symmetry point, the unitary transmission is achieved, $G_{\rm max}= G_0 = 2e^2/h$;
see short-dashed line in \fig{G-T}(a).
An experimentally relevant definition of $T_K$ is that at $T=T_K$ 
$G(T)=G_{\rm max}/2$. $T_K$ is exponentially small in 
the local exchange $J_0 = 8\Gamma / (\pi \rho U)$, and is approximated by
$T_K \approx D \exp[-1/(\rho J_0)]$ \cite{Hewson_book}.

The presence of a second side-coupled QD, $t,U'>0$, significantly enriches the physics of the system 
by introducing direct exchange between QDs, see \fig{system}(b-d).
In general, effective inter-dot exchange can be defined as energy difference between 
the triplet and singlet states of isolated DQD, 
$J^{\mathrm{eff}} = E_{S=1} - E_{\rm GS}$. Unless $U$ becomes very large, superexchange can be neglected
\cite{Zitko_2QDEx} and $J^{\mathrm{eff}}$ is determined by \emph{direct exchange}, $J^{\mathrm{eff}}\approx 4t^2/(U-U')>0$.
When the hopping $t$ is tuned small \cite{CPS1}, one can expect $J^{\mathrm{eff}}\lesssim T_K$, which 
implies the two-stage Kondo screening \cite{Pustilnik_Glazman,Cornaglia}.
Then, for $T \ll T_K$, the local spectral density of QD1 serves as a band of width $\sim T_K$ for QD2.
The spin of an electron occupying QD2 
experiences the Kondo screening below the associated Kondo temperature
\begin{equation}
T^* = a T_K \exp(- b T_K / J_{\rm eff})
\label{Tstar}
\end{equation}
with $a$ and $b$ constants of order of unity \cite{Pustilnik_Glazman,Cornaglia}.
This is reflected in conductance, which drops to $0$ with lowering $T$, maintaining characteristic 
Fermi-liquid 
$G\sim T^2$ dependence \cite{Cornaglia}; see the curves indicated with squares 
in \fig{G-T}(a). Similarly to $T_K$, experimentally relevant definition of $T^*$ is that 
$G(T\!=\!T^*) = G_{\rm max}/2$. Even at the particle-hole 
symmetry point $G_{\rm max} < G_0$, because the single-QD strong-coupling fixed point 
is unstable in the presence of QD2 and $G(T)$ does not achieve $G_0$ exactly,
before it starts to decrease.


The proximity of SC gives rise to two further exchange mechanisms that
determine the system's behavior. First of all, the (conventional)
\emph{RKKY interaction} appears, $J \sim \GS{}^2$ \cite{RK,K,Y}. 
Moreover, the \emph{CAR exchange} emerges as a consequence of finite $\GS{}$ \cite{Yao}. 
It can be understood on the basis 
of perturbation theory as follows. DQD in the inter-dot singlet state may absorb
and re-emit a Cooper pair approaching from SC; see \fig{system}(e)-(g). As a second-order
process, it reduces the energy of the singlet, which is the ground state of isolated DQD.
A similar process is not possible in the triplet state due to spin conservation.
Therefore, the singlet-triplet energy splitting $J^{\mathrm{eff}}$ is increased (or generated for $t=J=0$). 
More precisely, the leading ($2$nd-order in $t$ and $\GS{}$) terms
in the total exchange are 
\begin{equation}
J^{\mathrm{eff}} 	\approx 	J + \frac{4t^2}{U-U'+\frac{3}{4}J} + \frac{4\GS{}^2}{U+U'+\frac{3}{4}J}.
\label{Jeff}
\end{equation}
Using this estimation, one can predict $T^*$ for finite $\GS{}$, $t$ and $J$ with \eq{Tstar}.
Apparently, from three contributions corresponding to:
(i) RKKY interaction, (ii) direct exchange and (iii) CAR exchange, only the first may bear a negative (ferromagnetic) sign.
The two other contributions always have an anti-ferromagnetic nature.
More accurate expression for $J^{\mathrm{eff}}$ is derived in Appendix~\ref{sec:downfolding}
[see \eq{A_J}] by the Hamiltonian down-folding procedure. The relevant terms differ 
by factors important only for large $\GS{}/U$. 
Finally, it seems worth stressing that normal leads are not necessary for CAR exchange to occur.
At least one of them is inevitable for the Kondo screening though, and two symmetrically coupled 
normal leads allow for measurement of the normal conductance.


It is also noteworthy that inter-dot Coulomb interactions
decrease the energy of intermediate states contributing to direct exchange 
[\fig{system}(c)], while increasing the energy of intermediate
states causing the CAR exchange [\fig{system}(f)].
This results in different dependence of corresponding terms in \eq{Jeff} on $U'$.
As can be seen in \figs{G-T}(b) and \ref{fig:G-T}(c), it has a significant effect 
on the actual values of $T^*$.

\section{CAR exchange and Kondo effect}
\label{sec:main}

To verify \eqs{Tstar}-(\ref{Jeff}) we calculate $G$ using
accurate full density matrix numerical renormalization group (NRG) technique \cite{WilsonNRG,Weichselbaum,FlexibleDMNRG,fn2}.
We compare $U'=0$ case with experimentally relevant value $U'=U/10$ \cite{Keller2013Dec}.
While for two close adatoms on SC surface RKKY interactions may lead to prominent consequences
\cite{Klinovaja}, the conventional ({\it i.e.} non-CAR) contribution should 
vanish rapidly when the inter-impurity distance $r$ exceeds a few lattice constants \cite{RKKYrange,SC_RKKY}. 
Meanwhile, the CAR exchange may remain significant for $r$ of the order
of coherence length of the SC contact \cite{Yao}. Therefore, we first neglect the conventional RKKY coupling and analyze its consequences in Sec.~\ref{sec:RKKY}.

The main results are presented in \fig{G-T}(a), showing the temperature dependence of $G$
for different circumstances. 
For reference, results for $\GS{}=0$ are shown, exhibiting 
the two-stage Kondo effect caused by \emph{direct} exchange mechanism.
As can be seen in \figs{G-T}(b) and \ref{fig:G-T}(c), an excellent agreement of $T^*$ found from NRG calculations and \eq{Tstar} 
is obtained with $a=0.42$ and $b=1.51$, the same for both $U'=0$ and $U'=U/10$. Note, 
however, that $J^{\mathrm{eff}}$ is different in these cases, cf. \eq{Jeff},
and $U'$ leads to increase of $T^*$.

Furthermore, for $t=0$ and $\GS{}>0$ the two-stage Kondo effect caused solely by the \emph{CAR
exchange} is present; see \fig{G-T}(a).
Experimentally, this situation
corresponds to a distance between the two QDs smaller than the superconducting coherence length,
but large enough for the exponentially suppressed direct hopping to be negligible.
While intuitively one could expect pairing to compete with any kind of magnetic ordering,
the Kondo screening induced by CAR exchange is a beautiful example of a superconductivity
in fact leading to magnetic order, namely the formation of the Kondo singlet.
This CAR-exchange-mediated Kondo screening is our main finding.
For such screening, \eq{Tstar} is still fulfilled with very similar 
parameters, $a=0.37$ ($a=0.35$) and $b=1.51$ ($b=1.50$) for $U'=0$ ($U'=U/10$),
correspondingly; see \figs{G-T}(b-c).
Moreover, as follows from \eq{Jeff}, $U'$ reduces CAR exchange, and therefore diminishes $T^*$.
For the same values of $J^{\mathrm{eff}}$, the dependence of $G(T)$ for $t=0$ and $\GS{}>0$ is hardly different 
from the one for $\GS{}=0$ and $t>0$ for $T\geq T^*$ (results not shown).
However, $G(T)$ saturates at residual value $G_{\mathrm{min}}$ as $T\to 0$ only for finite
$\GS{}$, which at particle-hole symmetry makes $G_{\mathrm{min}}$
the hallmark of SC proximity and the corresponding CAR exchange processes.
From numerical results, one can estimate it as
\begin{equation}
G_{\mathrm{min}} = \frac{e^2}{h} \cdot c \, \frac{\GS{}^2}{U^2} 
	\qquad {\scriptstyle (\GS{1}=\GS{2}=\GS{})} ,
\label{Gmin}
\end{equation}
with $c\approx 2.25$, barely depending on $U'$ and getting smaller for $t>0$. 
This is illustrated in \figs{G-T}(d-e), where the dotted line corresponds to \eq{Gmin} with $c=2.25$. 

Lastly, in \fig{G-T}(a) we also present the curves obtained for $t=\GS{}$ chosen such, 
that the quantity $\xi=\sqrt{t^2+\GS{}^2}$ remains the same 
in all the cases.
This is to illustrate what happens when \emph{both} (direct and CAR) exchange interactions are
present. \fig{G-T}(c) clearly shows that $T^*$ remains practically unaltered for $U'=0$.
The comparison with \fig{G-T}(b) proves that in this case it practically does not depend 
on $U'$. The enhancement of direct exchange is compensated by the decrease of the CAR one. 
On the contrary, $G_{\mathrm{min}}$ decreases for larger $t$ below the estimation given by Eq.~(\ref{Gmin}), 
as can be seen in \figs{G-T}(d-e). 

While analyzing the results concerning $G_{\mathrm{min}}(\GS{})$ plotted in \figs{G-T}(d-e) 
one needs to keep in mind that $G_{\mathrm{min}}$ is obtained at deeply cryogenic conditions. To illustrate
this better, $G(\GS{})$ obtained for $t=0$ and $T=10^{-6}U$ is plotted with solid line 
in \fig{3}. Clearly, for weak $\GS{}$ the system exhibits rather conventional (single-stage)
Kondo effect with $G=G_{\mathrm{max}}\approx 2e^2/h$, while QD2 is effectively decoupled ($G_{\mathrm{max}}<2e^2/h$
in the proximity of SC lead \cite{KWIW}). Only for larger values of $\GS{}$
the CAR exchange is strong enough, such that $T^*>T$ and the dependence $G(\GS{})$ continuously 
approaches the $T=0$ limit estimated by \eq{Gmin} and presented in \figs{G-T}(d-e).

\section{CAR-RKKY competition}
\label{sec:RKKY}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{Fig3.pdf}
\caption{Linear conductance $G$ vs. $\GS{}$ calculated

		 for points on $J=-0.1U$ curve, indicated with corresponding symbols.
		}
\label{fig:3}
\end{figure}

Let us now discuss the effects introduced by the conventional RKKY interaction.
We choose $t=0$ for the sake of simplicity and
analyze a wide range of $\GS{}$, starting from the case of anti-ferromagnetic 
RKKY interaction ($J>0$). Large $J>0$ leads to the formation of a molecular singlet in the 
nanostructure. This suppresses the conductance, unless $\GS{}$ becomes of the order of $U/2$, 
when the excited states of DQD are all close to the ground state. This is illustrated 
by double-dotted line in \fig{3}.
Smaller value of $J>0$ causes less dramatic consequences, namely it just increases $J^{\mathrm{eff}}$ according
to \eq{Jeff}, leading to enhancement of $T^*$, cf. \eq{Tstar}. This is presented with
dot-dashed line in \fig{3}.

The situation changes qualitatively for ferromagnetic RKKY coupling, $J<0$.
Then, RKKY exchange and CAR exchange have opposite signs and compete with each other.
Depending on their magnitudes and temperature, one
of the following scenarios may happen.

For $J^{\mathrm{eff}} > 0$, {\it i.e.} large enough $\GS{}$, and $T<T^*$, the system is in the 
singlet state due to the two-stage Kondo screening of DQD spins. $G(T\!=\!0)$ is reduced 
to $G_{\mathrm{min}}$, which tends to increase for large negative $J$; see dashed lines in \fig{3}. 
In the inset to \fig{3}, the spectral density of QD1 representative for this regime is plotted 
as curve indicated by triangle. It corresponds to a point on the $J=-0.1U$ curve in the main 
plot, also indicated by triangle. The dip in $\mathcal{A}(\omega)$ has width of order of $T^*$.

For finite $T$, there is always a range of sufficiently small $|J^{\mathrm{eff}}|$, where QD2 becomes effectively
decoupled, and, provided $T<T_K$, $G$ reaches $G_{\mathrm{max}}$ due to conventional Kondo effect 
at QD1. This is the case for sufficiently small $\GS{}$ for $J=0$ or $J=-0.01U$, and in the narrow
range of $\GS{}$ around the point indicated by a circle in \fig{3} for $J=-0.1U$ (for $J=0.01U$, 
the considered $T$ is close to $T^*$ and $G$ does not reach $G_{\rm max}$). The conventional Kondo effect manifests itself with 
a characteristic peak in $\mathcal{A}(\omega)$, as illustrated in the inset in \fig{3} with line denoted by circle.

Finally, large enough $J^{\mathrm{eff}} < 0$ and low $T$, give rise to an effective ferromagnetic coupling of DQDs 
spins into triplet state. Consequently, the underscreened Kondo effect occurs 
\cite{Mattis,NozieresBlandin} for weak $\GS{}$ and, {\it e.g.}, $J=-0.1U$; 
see the point indicated by square in \fig{3}.
This leads to $G=G_{\mathrm{max}}$ and a peak in $\mathcal{A}(\omega)$, whose shape is significantly different from the
Kondo peak, cf. the curve denoted by square in the inset in \fig{3}. 



\section{Effects of detuning from the particle-hole symmetry point}
\label{sec:asym}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{Fig4.pdf}

         detuning from particle-hole symmetry point, $\delta_1=-\delta_2$, 
         and two values of $\xi=\sqrt{t^2+\GS{}^2}$, as indicated in the figure.
         (b) $G_{\mathrm{min}} \equiv G(T \!=\! 0)$ as a function of QD1 detuning $\delta_1$ for different

		}
\label{fig:asym}
\end{figure}

At PHS $G_{\mathrm{min}}=G(T \!=\! 0)=0$ in the absence of superconducting lead, making $G_{\mathrm{min}} > 0$ a hallmark
of SC-induced two-stage Kondo effect. However, outside of PHS point $G_{\mathrm{min}} > 0$ even in the case of 
the two-stage Kondo effect caused by the direct exchange. 
Exact PHS conditions are hardly possible in real systems, and the fine-tuning of the QD energy
levels to PHS point is limited to some finite accuracy.
Therefore, there may appear a question, if the results obtained at PHS are of any importance for the
realistic setups. As we show below --- they are,
in a reasonable range of detunings $\delta_i=\varepsilon_i +U/2$.

In \fig{asym}(a) we present the $G(T)$ dependence in and outside the PHS, corresponding to 
parameters of \fig{G-T}(a). 
Clearly, for considered small values of $\delta_1=\delta_2=\delta$, 
$G_{\mathrm{min}}<10^{-3}e^2/h$ for direct exchange only, while $G_{\mathrm{min}}$ in the presence of a superconductor is 
significantly increased and close to the PHS value. Furthermore, for $|\delta_1| \sim |\delta_2| 
\sim \delta$, the residual conductance caused by the lack of PHS, $G_{\mathrm{min}} \approx e^2/h \cdot (\delta/U)^2$,
which is a rapidly decreasing function in the vicinity of PHS point, as illustrated in \fig{asym}(b)
with lines denoted by a square. Evidently, in the regime $|\delta_i| < 0.01U$ the residual conductance
caused by SC is orders of magnitude larger, leading to the plateau in $G_{\mathrm{min}}(\delta_1)$ dependence,
visible in \fig{asym}(b).
Taking into account that the realistic values of $U$ in the semiconductor quantum dots are rather 
large, this condition seems to be realizable by fine-tuning of QD gate voltages.

Lastly, let us point out that while in the presence of only one exchange mechanism, \emph{CAR} or
\emph{direct}, $G_{\mathrm{min}}(\delta_1)$ dependencies depicted in \fig{asym}(b) are symmetrical with respect
to sign change of $\delta_1$, for \emph{both} exchange mechanisms the dependence is non-symmetric. 

\section{Effects of asymmetry of couplings to superconductor}
\label{sec:x}

\begin{figure}

\caption{

		}
\label{fig:x}
\end{figure}

Similarly to PHS, the ideal symmetry in the coupling between respective QDs and SC lead is hardly possible
in experimental reality. As shown below, it does not introduce any qualitatively new features.
On the other hand, it decreases the second stage Kondo temperature, which is already small, therefore,
quantitative estimation of this decrease may be important for potential experimental approaches.
To analyze the effects of $\GS{1}\neq\GS{2}$, we introduce the asymmetry parameter $x$ and extend
the definition of $\GS{}$,
\beq
x = \frac{\GS{1}-\GS{2}}{\GS{1}+\GS{2}}, \quad \GS{} = \frac{\GS{1}+\GS{2}}{2}.
\label{xGS}
 \end{equation} 
Note, that even for a fixed $\GS{}$, the actual CAR coupling $\GS{\rm X}=\GS{}\sqrt{1-x^2}$ decreases
with increasing $|x|$, which is a main mechanism leading to a decrease of $T^*$ outside the $x=0$ point
visible in \figs{x}(a) and (b). To illustrate this, the curves corresponding to \emph{both} exchange
mechanisms were calculated using $x$-dependent $t=\GS{\rm X}$ instead of $t=\xi/\sqrt{2}$. 
Therefore, $\xi$ was generalized for $x\neq 0$ by setting $\xi=\sqrt{t^2(1-x^2)^{-1}+\GS{}^2}$.
Clearly, in \fig{x}(b) the curves for different exchange mechanisms are very similar and differ mainly 
by a constant factor, resulting from different influence of $U'$; see \Sec{scales}. 
The magnitude of $T^*$ changes is quite large, exceeding an order of magnitude for $x=\pm 0.5$ 
and $\xi=U/20$. Moreover, $T^* \to 0$ for $x\to\pm 1$. Consequently, for strongly asymmetric
devices one cannot hope to observe the second stage of Kondo screening.

A careful observer can note that the $T^*(x)$ dependency is not symmetrical; note for example different 
$T^*$ for $x=\pm 0.5$ in \fig{x}(a). This is caused by the dependence of the first stage Kondo temperature
$T_K$ on $\GS{1}$ \cite{part1,DomanskiIW},
\beq
\widetilde{T}_K(\GS{1}) = T_K \cdot \exp\!\left( \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{\GS{1}^2}{\Gamma U}\right).
 \end{equation} 
Here, $T_K$ is, as earlier, defined in the absence of SC, while $\widetilde{T}_K$ is a function 
of $\GS{1}$, such that $G(\widetilde{T}_K) = G_{\rm max}(\GS{1})/2$ in the absence of QD2. 
As $\widetilde{T}_K$ grows for increasing $\GS{1}$ (or $x$), $T^*$ decreases according to \eq{Tstar}. 
Its $\GS{}$ dependence can be accounted for by small changes in the coefficients $a$ and $b$ in \eq{Tstar}, 
as long as $x$ is kept constant. 

To close the discussion of $T^*(x)$ dependence let us point out, that in \eq{A_J} 
there appears a correction to \eq{Jeff} for $x\neq 0$. However, it is very small due to additional
factor $\GS{}^2/U^2$ in the leading order. Its influence on curves plotted in \fig{x}(b) is hardly visible.

In turn, let us examine the $x$ dependence of the $T=0$ conductance $G_{\mathrm{min}}$. As can be seen 
in \fig{x}(a), it monotonically increases with $x$, as it crosses $x=0$ point. In fact, \eq{Gmin}
can be generalized to
\beq
G_{\mathrm{min}} = \frac{e^2}{h} \cdot c \, \frac{\GS{1}^2}{U^2} ,
\label{Gmin2}
 \end{equation} 
with $c\approx 2.25$ (indicated by a dotted line in \fig{x}(c)). Note that $G_{\mathrm{min}}$ is proportional to 
$\GS{1}^2=(x+1)^2 \GS{}^2$, instead of simply $\GS{}$, cf. \eq{Gmin}. The values of $G_{\mathrm{min}}$ obtained
from all analyzed $G(T)$ dependencies for different $x$ have been compiled in \fig{x}(c).
It is evident, that \eq{Gmin2} is approximately fulfilled for all the considered cases.

Finally, it seems noteworthy that the normal-lead coupling asymmetry, 
$\Gamma_{\rm L}\neq \Gamma_{\rm R}$, is irrelevant for the results except for a constant factor
diminishing the conductance $G$ \cite{KWIWJB-asym}.



\section{The role of CAR efficiency}
\label{sec:coef}

\begin{figure}[tb]

\caption{Linear conductance between the normal leads

\label{fig:C}
\end{figure}

Up to this point we assumed $\GS{\rm X} = \sqrt{\GS{1}\GS{2}}$, which is valid when the two 
quantum dots are much closer to each other than the coherence length in the superconductor.
This does not have to be the case in real setups, yet relaxing this assumption does not 
introduce qualitative changes. Nevertheless, the model cannot be extended to inter-dot 
distances much larger than the coherence length, where $\GS{\rm X}\to 0$.

To quantitatively analyze the consequences of less effective Andreev coupling we define the 
CAR efficiency as $\mathcal{C} \equiv \GS{\rm X} / \sqrt{\GS{1}\GS{2}}$ and analyze $\mathcal{C} < 1$
in the wide range of $\GS{1}=\GS{2}=\GS{}$ and other parameters corresponding to \fig{3}. 
The results are presented in \fig{C}.

Clearly, decreasing $\mathcal{C}$ from $\mathcal{C}=1$ causes diminishing of $\GS{\rm X}$, and consequently of CAR 
exchange. For a change as small as $\mathcal{C}=0.9$, the consequences reduce to some shift of the 
conventional Kondo regime, compare \fig{C}(a) with \fig{3}. Stronger suppression of CAR may, 
however, increase the SC coupling necessary to observe the second stage of Kondo screening caused
by CAR outside the experimentally achievable range, see \fig{C}(b). Moreover, the reduced $T^*$
leads to narrowing of the related local spectral density dip, while the
increased critical $\GS{}$ necessary for the observation of the second stage of screening leads to the
shallowing of the dip. This is visible especially in the inset in \fig{C}(b).


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The CAR exchange mechanism is present in any system comprising at least
two QDs or magnetic impurities coupled to the same superconducting contact
in a way allowing for crossed Andreev reflections.
In the considered setup, comprised of two quantum dots in a T-shaped geometry 
with respect to normal leads and proximized by superconductor,
it leads to the two-stage Kondo
screening even in the absence of other exchange mechanisms.
This CAR induced exchange screening is characterized by a residual 
low-temperature conductance at particle-hole symmetric case.
We have also shown that the competition between CAR exchange and RKKY
interaction may result in completely different Kondo screening scenarios.

The presented results bring further insight into the low-temperature
behavior of hybrid coupled quantum dot systems, which hopefully could be verified
with the present-day experimental techniques.
Moreover, non-local pairing is present also in bulk systems such as non-$s$-wave superconductors.
The question if an analogue of discussed CAR exchange may play a role there
seems intriguing in the context of tendencies of many strongly correlated materials
to possess superconducting and anti-ferromagnetic phases.

",['It tends to suppress the Kondo effect.'],5009,multifieldqa_en,en,,917f18543035ee1b9161cded1d3352531dbf3b249b5f0a18," The exchange interactions control the magnetic order and properties of a vast number of materials. They lead to many fascinating phenomena, such as various types of the Kondo effect. The effect can be understood as a consequence of spin-dependent hybridization of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states. This process is the most effective when the YSR states are close to the middle of the SC gap. The mechanism presented here is essentially the same, yet in the considered regime can be better understood without referring to Y SR states. It can be seen as RKKY-like interaction between two nearby impurities on SC surface. The presence of YSR bound to the Fermi level is not necessary for Kondo physics, as long as some inter-dot pairing in QDs is present in Qozhkov-Zitko-and-Vazifeh system. It is also possible to suppress the effect if the superconducting energy gap $2Delta$ is larger than the relevant Kondo temperature $T_Kondo_vs_SC1,Kondo-vs-SC2,and-Andreev-QD-T-Vzitko. The interaction can greatly modify the low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures. It also has significant consequences for the ermerm level level. The Kondo screening can be the sole cause of the CAR exchange. Car exchange magnitude can be directly related to the relevant energy scales, such as the Kondo temperature. The Kondo physics becomes qualitatively affected only for $U/2$. The paper is organized as follows. In the main section, we describe the considered system and present the model we use to study it. We then discuss the influence of effects neglected in themain section, including CAR exchange interplay with RKKY interaction, particle-hole asymmetry and reduced efficiency of CAR coupling. We conclude the paper with the conclusion that the CAR-induced Kondo effect is qualitatively valid in all these cases. The study is published in the open-access journal The Astrophysics of Superconducting Matter (ASM) (http://www.astrophysics.org/ASM/2013/01/27/kondo-screening-in-superconducting-matter.html#storylink=cpy;. ASM is an open-source, non-profit organization that aims to improve the understanding of superconducting matter. The ASM website is: www.asm.org.uk/news/2013-01/26/kondoscreening.html. We focus on the sub-gap regime, therefore, we integrate out SC degrees of freedom lying outside the energy gap. This gives rise to the following effective Hamiltonian, which is the Hamiltonian of the SC-proximized DQD. We note that the procedure of integrating out out-gap states neglects the RKKY interaction mediated by SC lead and other possible indirect exchange mechanisms. Nevertheless, all discussed phenomena are present in a full model for energies smaller than SC gap. The model is strictly valid in the regime where $Delta$ is the largest houselessenergy scale. We conclude that the model pinpoints the fact that the non-local pairing is sufficient for the occurrence of the CAR exchange. The presence of out- gap states shall result mainly in additional broadening of D QD energy levels, changing the relevant Kondo temperatures. The total energy of the model is described in the total energy model described in Ref. Other, the reduced reduced gap limit, and additional antromagnetic contribution would arise for finite gap. To compensate for this, we treat normal leads as reservoirs of nonacting electrons, denoting the spin operator QD$i, and substituting a Heisenberg term $J$and a coupling $J. The spin of an electron occupying QD2 experiences the Kondo screening below the associated Kondo temperature. The local spectral density of QD1 serves as a band of width for QD 2. The presence of a second side-coupled QD, $t,U'>0, significantly enriches the physics of the system. The conductance as a function of temperature, $G(T)$, grows below the Konda temperature $T_K$ and reaches maximum for $T\to 0. A single-QD strong-cpling point is unstable in the presence of the single particle-hole symmetry point, because the single QD is unstable at the particle- hole symmetry point. This is reflected in the characteristic Fermi-liquid dependence of $0$$G2$ and $G1$ in the curves indicated with the squares indicated with squares. The results are consistent with an order of unity of unity with $a and $b$ constants of unity, and with $Tstar$ of $1 and $B$  of $2  in the model. The model is based on a maximal CAR coupling, $GS{1}\GS{2} = \sqrt{\GS{ 1}\GS {2}=\GS{}$ From three contributions corresponding to RKKY interaction, direct exchange and CAR exchange, only the first may bear a negative (ferromagnetic) sign. At least one of them is inevitable for the Kondo screening though, and two symmetrically coupled leads allow for measurement of the normal conductance. Inter-dot Coulomb interactions increase the energy of intermediate states contributing to direct exchange, while increasing theenergy of intermediatestates causing CAR exchange. This results in different dependence of corresponding terms in the Hamiltonian down-folding procedure. The main results are presented in Fig. 2, showing the dependence of $G$ on the temperature $G-T(a) and $U'T(b) for different circumstances. For different reference, see Sec. 1, Sec. 2 and Sec. 3 in the appendix for more details on how to calculate the coefficients of interest for $G and $T-T (G-G, T-T, U'T, G-U, U/5, G/5) and how to measure the residual conductance $G(T) for $t=0$ (denoted ""CAR"") and $t =0 (Denoted ""Both""). For different circumstances, see the Appendix for more information. The Kondo screening induced by CAR exchange is a beautiful example of a superconductivity leading to magnetic order, namely the formation of the Kondo singlet. The enhancement of direct exchange is compensated by the decrease of the CAR one. Only for larger values of CAR is the exchange strong enough that the dependence of $G(T)$ on $U' is hardly different from the one for $t=0$ and $t>0$ for $T\geq T^*$ (results not shown) The Kondo effect is the hallmark of SC proximity and the corresponding CAR exchange processes. It is the result of the interaction between SC and the CAR exchange process, which is a result of particle-hole symmetry. It can be seen in the figure below, where the dotted line corresponds to $Gmin$ with $c=2.25$ and a solid line is plotted with solid line $T=10 -6 U$. The quantity $G(\GS{})$ obtained for $ t=0-$10-6$ is plotted in a different way, with $C\approx 2.25$, barely depending on $u'$ and getting smaller for $o'=0$. The results are shown in the table below, which shows how $G('T') saturates at residual value $G_{\mathrm{min')$ only for finite values of $t. RKKY exchange and CAR exchange have opposite signs and compete with each other. Depending on their magnitudes and temperature, one of the following scenarios may happen. The conventional Kondo effect manifests itself with a characteristic peak in QD1. This is the case for sufficiently small $G$ for $J=0$ or $J=-0.01U$ and for finite $T$. For weak $T$, there is always a range of $|J$ where QD2 becomes effectivelydecoupled. This leads to an effective ferromagnetic coupling of DQDs into triplet state. The effect is a hallmark of SC-induced two-stage Kondo effects. However, it can also be caused by the absence of superconducting lead, such as in the case of a PHS-induced PHS effect outside the PHS point of PHS, or by the use of a ‘delta-delta’ effect, where the superconductivity of the lead is reduced by a factor of 2.5 or 3.5, depending on the type of lead. For example, the ‘Delta-Delta Effect’ can be caused if the superconductor is not present in the lead at the time of the event. In the regime $|\delta_i| < 0.01U$ the residual conductance caused by SC is orders of magnitude larger, leading to the plateau in $G_min2$ dependence. The ideal symmetry in the coupling between respective QDs and SC lead is hardly possible in experimental reality. As shown below, it does not introduce any qualitatively new features. On the other hand, it decreases the second stage Kondo temperature, which is already small, therefore,quantitative estimation of this decrease may be important for potential experimental approaches. To analyze the effects of $x$ we introduce the asymmetry parameter $x and extend the definition of $\GS{1}$, which is a main mechanism leading to a decrease of $T^*$ outside the $x=0$ point. To illustrate this, the curves corresponding to exchangechanisms were calculated using $x-dependent $t==1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/12/13/14/15/16/17/18/19/20/21/22/23/24/25/26/27/28/28-28/29/30/31/32/32-33/34/33/36/37/38/36-37/37-38-38/38-39/39/40/41/42/41-42/43/44/45/46/47/48/49/50/52/53/54/55/56/57/58/59/60/61/62/63/64/65/66/67/68/69/70/72/73/74/75/ The model cannot be extended to inter-dot distances much larger than the coherence length of the superconductor. The normal-lead coupling asymmetry is irrelevant for the results except for a constant factor. The efficiency of CAR processes reduced by factor (a) $\mathcal{C}=0.9$ and (b) ($C) =0.5$. The results are presented in the results section of the Kondo Kondo regime. For a comparison with the conventional regime, compare the results with those of the Strong Conventional regime, which is much more robust to changes in the coupling between the two superconductors. The model can be used to understand the consequences of less effective and/or less effective coupling in the superconducting regime, and to identify the causes of diminishing efficiency in the CAR regime. It can also be used as a basis for the design of new supercondensations. The results section is titled ‘The role of CAR efficiency’ and includes the following sections: ‘Car efficiency,’ ‘C’, ‘Efficiency of the Superconductor,‘ and ‘CAR Processes’. The full results are available at: http://www.kondo.org/kondo/car-processes/Car-Processes.html. erized by a residual low-temperature conductance at particle-hole symmetric case. Competition between CAR exchange and RKKYinteraction may result in completely different Kondo screening scenarios. Non-local pairing is present also in bulk systems such as non-$s$-wave superconductors."

Lightning is one of the most dramatic effects of electricity.
Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge. In early days, electricity was considered as being not related to magnetism. Later on, many experimental results and the development of Maxwell's equations indicated that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon: electromagnetism. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.
The presence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field.
When a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.
electronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.
Electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.
Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the ""Thunderer of the Nile"", and described them as the ""protectors"" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients suffering from ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them. Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of lightning, and electricity from any other source, is to be attributed to the Arabs, who before the 15th century had the Arabic word for lightning ra‘ad (رعد) applied to the electric ray.
Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.
Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research on electricity in the 18th century, as documented by Joseph Priestley (1767) History and Present Status of Electricity, with whom Franklin carried on extended correspondence.
Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (""of amber"" or ""like amber"", from ἤλεκτρον, elektron, the Greek word for ""amber"") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words ""electric"" and ""electricity"", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.
Further work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.
In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère in 1819–1820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his ""On Physical Lines of Force"" in 1861 and 1862.
While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.
In 1887, Heinrich Hertz:843–44 discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for ""his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels and this is frequently used to make electricity commercially.
The first solid-state device was the ""cat's-whisker detector"" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.
The solid-state device came into its own with the invention of the transistor in 1947. Common solid-state devices include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).
The presence of charge gives rise to an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity.:457 A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated in the late eighteenth century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.
The force acts on the charged particles themselves, hence charge has a tendency to spread itself as evenly as possible over a conducting surface. The magnitude of the electromagnetic force, whether attractive or repulsive, is given by Coulomb's law, which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an inverse-square relation to the distance between them.:35 The electromagnetic force is very strong, second only in strength to the strong interaction, but unlike that force it operates over all distances. In comparison with the much weaker gravitational force, the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart is 1042 times that of the gravitational attraction pulling them together.
Study has shown that the origin of charge is from certain types of subatomic particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an electrically isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire.:2–5 The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.
The charge on electrons and protons is opposite in sign, hence an amount of charge may be expressed as being either negative or positive. By convention, the charge carried by electrons is deemed negative, and that by protons positive, a custom that originated with the work of Benjamin Franklin. The amount of charge is usually given the symbol Q and expressed in coulombs; each electron carries the same charge of approximately −1.6022×10−19 coulomb. The proton has a charge that is equal and opposite, and thus +1.6022×10−19 coulomb. Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle.
The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.
By historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.
The process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second,:17 the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.
Current causes several observable effects, which historically were the means of recognising its presence. That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by Nicholson and Carlisle in 1800, a process now known as electrolysis. Their work was greatly expanded upon by Michael Faraday in 1833. Current through a resistance causes localised heating, an effect James Prescott Joule studied mathematically in 1840.:23–24 One of the most important discoveries relating to current was made accidentally by Hans Christian Ørsted in 1820, when, while preparing a lecture, he witnessed the current in a wire disturbing the needle of a magnetic compass. He had discovered electromagnetism, a fundamental interaction between electricity and magnetics. The level of electromagnetic emissions generated by electric arcing is high enough to produce electromagnetic interference, which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment.
In engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.:11 If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave.:206–07 Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance.:223–25 These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.
The concept of the electric field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.
A hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore zero at all places inside the body.:88 This is the operating principal of the Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects.
The principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30 kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1 kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100 MV and have discharge energies as great as 250 kWh.
A pair of AA cells. The + sign indicates the polarity of the potential difference between the battery terminals.
The concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity.:494–98 This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated.:494–98 The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.
For practical purposes, it is useful to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.
Electric potential is a scalar quantity, that is, it has only magnitude and not direction. It may be viewed as analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.
Ørsted's discovery in 1821 that a magnetic field existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current indicated that there was a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. Moreover, the interaction seemed different from gravitational and electrostatic forces, the two forces of nature then known. The force on the compass needle did not direct it to or away from the current-carrying wire, but acted at right angles to it. Ørsted's slightly obscure words were that ""the electric conflict acts in a revolving manner."" The force also depended on the direction of the current, for if the flow was reversed, then the force did too.
Ørsted did not fully understand his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents in the same direction are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere.
This relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for it led to Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting in a pool of mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet for as long as the current was maintained.
Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 revealed that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.

The ability of chemical reactions to produce electricity, and conversely the ability of electricity to drive chemical reactions has a wide array of uses.
Electrochemistry has always been an important part of electricity. From the initial invention of the Voltaic pile, electrochemical cells have evolved into the many different types of batteries, electroplating and electrolysis cells. Aluminium is produced in vast quantities this way, and many portable devices are electrically powered using rechargeable cells.
A basic electric circuit. The voltage source V on the left drives a current I around the circuit, delivering electrical energy into the resistor R. From the resistor, the current returns to the source, completing the circuit.
An electric circuit is an interconnection of electric components such that electric charge is made to flow along a closed path (a circuit), usually to perform some useful task.
Electric power is the rate at which electric energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.
Electricity generation is often done with electric generators, but can also be supplied by chemical sources such as electric batteries or by other means from a wide variety of sources of energy. Electric power is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry. Electricity is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (3.6 MJ) which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. Electric utilities measure power using electricity meters, which keep a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity is a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high efficiency.
Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, sensors and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system.
Today, most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control. The study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of solid state physics, whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems come under electronics engineering.
Thus, the work of many researchers enabled the use of electronics to convert signals into high frequency oscillating currents, and via suitably shaped conductors, electricity permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances.
Early 20th-century alternator made in Budapest, Hungary, in the power generating hall of a hydroelectric station (photograph by Prokudin-Gorsky, 1905–1915).
In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus experimented with amber rods and these experiments were the first studies into the production of electrical energy. While this method, now known as the triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy. The battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged. For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines.
Electrical power is usually generated by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or from other sources such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention in the late nineteenth century of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.
Since electrical energy cannot easily be stored in quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses.
Electricity is a very convenient way to transfer energy, and it has been adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.
The resistive Joule heating effect employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, it can be seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.
Electricity is used within telecommunications, and indeed the electrical telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications. With the construction of first intercontinental, and then transatlantic, telegraph systems in the 1860s, electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe. Optical fibre and satellite communication have taken a share of the market for communications systems, but electricity can be expected to remain an essential part of the process.
The effects of electromagnetism are most visibly employed in the electric motor, which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric vehicle, is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery, or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph. Electrically powered vehicles are used in public transportation, such as electric buses and trains, and an increasing number of battery-powered electric cars in private ownership.
Electronic devices make use of the transistor, perhaps one of the most important inventions of the twentieth century, and a fundamental building block of all modern circuitry. A modern integrated circuit may contain several billion miniaturised transistors in a region only a few centimetres square.
A voltage applied to a human body causes an electric current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with the path of the current, but is about 0.1 mA to 1 mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.
Electricity is not a human invention, and may be observed in several forms in nature, a prominent manifestation of which is lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure. This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein (πιέζειν), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. The effect is reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field, a small change in physical dimensions takes place.
§Bioelectrogenesis in microbial life is a prominent phenomenon in soils and sediment ecology resulting from anaerobic respiration. The microbial fuel cell mimics this ubiquitous natural phenomenon.
Some organisms, such as sharks, are able to detect and respond to changes in electric fields, an ability known as electroreception, while others, termed electrogenic, are able to generate voltages themselves to serve as a predatory or defensive weapon. The order Gymnotiformes, of which the best known example is the electric eel, detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes. All animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials, whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles. An electric shock stimulates this system, and causes muscles to contract. Action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants.
In the 19th and early 20th century, electricity was not part of the everyday life of many people, even in the industrialised Western world. The popular culture of the time accordingly often depicted it as a mysterious, quasi-magical force that can slay the living, revive the dead or otherwise bend the laws of nature. This attitude began with the 1771 experiments of Luigi Galvani in which the legs of dead frogs were shown to twitch on application of animal electricity. ""Revitalization"" or resuscitation of apparently dead or drowned persons was reported in the medical literature shortly after Galvani's work. These results were known to Mary Shelley when she authored Frankenstein (1819), although she does not name the method of revitalization of the monster. The revitalization of monsters with electricity later became a stock theme in horror films.
As the public familiarity with electricity as the lifeblood of the Second Industrial Revolution grew, its wielders were more often cast in a positive light, such as the workers who ""finger death at their gloves' end as they piece and repiece the living wires"" in Rudyard Kipling's 1907 poem Sons of Martha. Electrically powered vehicles of every sort featured large in adventure stories such as those of Jules Verne and the Tom Swift books. The masters of electricity, whether fictional or real—including scientists such as Thomas Edison, Charles Steinmetz or Nikola Tesla—were popularly conceived of as having wizard-like powers.
With electricity ceasing to be a novelty and becoming a necessity of everyday life in the later half of the 20th century, it required particular attention by popular culture only when it stops flowing, an event that usually signals disaster. The people who keep it flowing, such as the nameless hero of Jimmy Webb’s song ""Wichita Lineman"" (1968), are still often cast as heroic, wizard-like figures.

Basic Concepts of Electricity chapter from Lessons In Electric Circuits Vol 1 DC book and series.","['Electricity is used for transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation.']",6202,multifieldqa_en,en,,b5b0eb150f44a4d7641b9adf9267ca0c2492ea46626449b3," Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others. In early days, electricity was considered as being not related to magnetism. Later on, many experimental results and the development of Maxwell's equations indicated that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon: electromagnetism. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society. People were aware of shocks from electric fish before any knowledge of electricity existed. Ancient Egyptian texts referred to these fish as the ""Thunderer of the Nile"", and described them as ""protectors"" of all other fish. Several ancient writers attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete. Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research on electricity in the 18th century, as documented by Joseph Priestley. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère in 1819–1820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz:843–44 discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. The first solid-state device was the ""cat's-whisker detector"" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a ge ge) to create electricity. The presence of charge gives rise to an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other. The magnitude of the electromagnetic force, whether attractive or repulsive, is given by Coulomb's law, which relates the force to the product of the charges. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Study has shown that the origin of charge is from certain types of subatomic particles which have the property of electric charge. The charge on electrons and protons is opposite in sign, hence an amount of charge may be expressed as being either negative or positive. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an electrically isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.manium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. Electric current can consist of any moving charged particles. Most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator. Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle. Current causes several observable effects, which historically were the means of recognising its presence. That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by Nicholson and Carlisle in 1800, a process now known as electrolysis. The level of electromagnetic emissions generated by electric arcing is high enough to produce electromagnetic interference, which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment. Current through a resistance causes localised heating, an effect James Prescott Joule studied mathematically in 1840. Current can be either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) These terms refer to how the current varies in time. The concept of the electric field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the gravitational field, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electricField can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric Field at a distance is usually zero. A hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore zero at all places inside the body.:88 This is the operating principal of the Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects. The principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric fields strength that may be withstood by any medium. Discovery in 1821 that a magnetic field existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current indicated that there was a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. The interaction seemed different from gravitational and electrostatic forces, the two forces of nature then known. The relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for it led to Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 18 21. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Electrochemical cells have evolved into the many different types of batteries, electroplating and electrolysis cells. Aluminium is produced in vast quantities this way, and many portable devices are electrically powered using rechargeable cells. The ability of chemical reactions to produce electricity, and conversely the ability of electricity to drive chemical reactions has a wide array of uses. It is the basis for the international definition of the ampere. Electricity generation is often done with electric generators, but can also be supplied by chemical sources such as electric batteries. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity is a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high efficiency. Electricity is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (3.6 MJ) which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. The study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of solid state physics, whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems come under electronics engineering. In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus experimented with amber rods. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources. Electricity is a very convenient way to transfer energy, and has been adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power.

What was Hugh H. Goodwin's rank in the United States Navy?,"Hugh Hilton Goodwin (December 21, 1900 – February 25, 1980) was a decorated officer in the United States Navy with the rank of Vice Admiral. A veteran of both World Wars, he commanded escort carrier  during the Mariana Islands campaign. Goodwin then served consecutively as Chief of Staff, Carrier Strike Group 6 and as Air Officer, Philippine Sea Frontier and participated in the Philippines campaign in the later part of the War.

Following the War, he remained in the Navy and rose to the flag rank and held several important commands including Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service, Commander, Carrier Division Two and Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command.

Early life and career

Hugh H. Goodwin was born on December 21, 1900, in Monroe, Louisiana and attended Monroe High School there (now Neville High School). Following the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, Goodwin left the school without receiving the diploma in order to see some combat and enlisted the United States Navy on May 7, 1917. He completed basic training and was assigned to the battleship . Goodwin participated in the training of armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war and in November 1917, he sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea.

Although he did not complete the last year of high school, Goodwin was able to earn an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918. While at the academy, he earned a nickname ""Huge"" and among his classmates were several future admirals and generals including: Hyman G. Rickover, Milton E. Miles, Robert E. Blick Jr., Herbert S. Duckworth, Clayton C. Jerome, James P. Riseley, James A. Stuart, Frank Peak Akers, Sherman Clark, Raymond P. Coffman, Delbert S. Cornwell, Frederick J. Eckhoff, Ralph B. DeWitt, John Higgins, Vernon Huber, Albert K. Morehouse, Harold F. Pullen, Michael J. Malanaphy, William S. Parsons, Harold R. Stevens, John P. Whitney, Lyman G. Miller and George J. O'Shea.

Goodwin graduated with Bachelor of Science degree on June 3, 1922, and was commissioned Ensign in the United States Navy. He was subsequently assigned to the battleship  and took part in the voyage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before he was ordered to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island for submarine instruction in June 1923. Goodwin completed the training several weeks later and was attached to the submarine . He then continued his further training aboard submarine  and following his promotion to Lieutenant (junior grade) on June 3, 1925, he qualified as submariner.

He then served aboard submarine  off the coast of California, before he was ordered for the recruiting duty to San Francisco in September 1927. While in this capacity, Goodwin applied for naval aviation training which was ultimately approved and he was ordered to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in August 1928. Toward the end of the training, he was promoted to lieutenant on December 11, 1928, and upon the completion of the training in January 1929, he was designated Naval aviator.

Goodwin was subsequently attached to the Observation Squadron aboard the aircraft carrier  and participated in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean. He was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. in August 1931 and served consecutively under the architect of naval aviation William A. Moffett and future Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King.

In June 1933, Goodwin was ordered to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, where he completed junior course in May of the following year. He subsequently joined the crew of aircraft carrier  and served under Captain Arthur B. Cook and took part in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States.

He was ordered back to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in June 1936 and was attached to the staff of the Base Commandant, then-Captain Charles A. Blakely. When Blakely was succeeded by William F. Halsey in June 1937, Goodwin remained in Halsey's staff and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on December 1, 1937. He also completed correspondence course in International law at the Naval War College.

Goodwin was appointed Commanding officer of the Observation Squadron 1 in June 1938 and attached to the battleship  he took part in the patrolling of the Pacific and 
West Coast of the United States until September 1938, when he assumed command of the Observation Squadron 2 attached to the battleship .

When his old superior from Lexington, now Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, was appointed Commander Aircraft, Scouting Force in June 1939, he requested Goodwin as his Aide and Flag Secretary. He became Admiral Cook's protégé and after year and half of service in the Pacific, he continued as his Aide and Flag Secretary, when Cook was appointed Commander Aircraft, Atlantic Fleet in November 1940.

World War II

Following the United States' entry into World War II, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Commander on January 1, 1942, and assumed duty as advisor to the Argentine Navy. His promotion was made permanent two months later and he returned to the United States in early 1943 for duty as assistant director of Planning in the Bureau of Aeronautics under Rear admiral John S. McCain. While still in Argentina, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Captain on June 21, 1942.

By the end of December 1943, Goodwin was ordered to Astoria, Oregon, where he assumed command of newly commissioned escort carrier USS Gambier Bay. He was responsible for the initial training of the crew and was known as a strict disciplinarian, but the crew appreciated the skills he taught them that prepared them for combat. Goodwin insisted that everyone aboard has to do every job right every time and made us fight our ship at her best.

During the first half of 1944, Gambier Bay was tasked with ferrying aircraft for repairs and qualified carrier pilots from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before departed on May 1, 1944, to join Rear admiral Harold B. Sallada's Carrier Support Group 2, staging in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas.

The air unit, VC-10 Squadron, under Goodwin's command gave close air support to the initial landings of Marines on Saipan on June 15, 1944, destroying enemy gun emplacements, troops, tanks, and trucks. On the 17th, her combat air patrol (CAP) shot down or turned back all but a handful of 47 enemy planes headed for her task group and her gunners shot down two of the three planes that did break through to attack her.

Goodwin's carrier continued in providing of close ground support operations at Tinian during the end of July 1944, then turned her attention to Guam, where she gave identical aid to invading troops until mid-August that year. For his service during the Mariana Islands campaign, Goodwin was decorated with Bronze Star Medal with Combat ""V"".

He was succeeded by Captain Walter V. R. Vieweg on August 18, 1944, and appointed Chief of Staff, Carrier Division Six under Rear admiral Arthur W. Radford. The Gambier Bay was sunk in the Battle off Samar on October 25, 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf after helping turn back a much larger attacking Japanese surface force.

Goodwin served with Carrier Division Six during the Bonin Islands raids, the naval operations at Palau and took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and operations supporting Leyte landings in late 1944. He was later appointed Air Officer of the Philippine Sea Frontier under Rear admiral James L. Kauffman and remained with that command until the end of hostilities. For his service in the later part of World War II, Goodwin was decorated with Legion of Merit with Combat ""V"". He was also entitled to wear two Navy Presidential Unit Citations and Navy Unit Commendation.

Postwar service

Following the surrender of Japan, Goodwin assumed command of Light aircraft carrier  on August 24, 1945. The ship was tasked with air missions over Japan became mercy flights over Allied prisoner-of-war camps, dropping food and medicine until the men could be rescued. She was also present at Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945.

Goodwin returned with San Jacinto to the United States in mid-September 1945 and he was detached in January 1946. He subsequently served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations until May that year, when he entered the instruction at National War College. Goodwin graduated in June 1947 and served on Secretary's committee for Research on Reorganization. Upon promotion to Rear admiral on April 1, 1949, Goodwin was appointed Chief of Staff and Aide to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet under Admiral William H. P. Blandy.

Revolt of the Admirals

In April 1949, the budget's cuts and proposed reorganization of the United States Armed Forces by the Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson launched the wave of discontent between senior commanders in the United States Navy. Johnson proposed the merging of the Marine Corps into the Army, and reduce the Navy to a convoy-escort force.

Goodwin's superior officer, Admiral Blandy was call to testify before the House Committee on Armed Services and his harsh statements for the defense of the Navy, costed him his career. Goodwin shared his views and openly criticized Secretary Johnson for having power concentrated in a single civilian executive, who is an appointee of the Government and not an elected representative of the people. He also criticized aspects of defense unification which permitted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to vote on arms policies of individual services, and thus ""rob"" the branches of autonomy.

The outbreak of the Korean War in summer 1950 proved the proposal of Secretary Johnson as incorrect and he resigned in September that year. Also Secretary of the Navy, Francis P. Matthews resigned one month earlier.

Later service

Due to the Revolts of the admirals, Blandy was forced to retire in February 1950 and Goodwin was ordered to Newport, Rhode Island for temporary duty as Chief of Staff and Aide to the President of the Naval War College under Vice admiral Donald B. Beary in April 1950. Goodwin was detached from that assignment two months and appointed member of the General Board of the Navy. He was shortly thereafter appointed acting Navy Chief of Public Information, as the substitute for Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey, who was relieved of illness, but returned to the General Board of the Navy in July that year. Goodwin served in that capacity until February 1951, when he relieved his Academy class, Rear admiral John P. Whitney as Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service (MATS).

While in this capacity, Goodwin served under Lieutenant general Laurence S. Kuter and was co-responsible for the logistical support of United Nations troops fighting in Korea. The MATS operated from the United States to Japan and Goodwin served in this capacity until August 1953, when he was appointed Commander Carrier Division Two. While in this assignment, he took part in the Operation Mariner, Joint Anglo-American exercise which encountered very heavy seas over a two-week period in fall 1953.

Goodwin was ordered to the Philippines in May 1954 and assumed duty as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines with headquarters at Naval Station Sangley Point near Cavite. He held that command in the period of tensions between Taiwan and China and publicly declared shortly after his arrival, that any attack on Taiwan by the Chinese Communists on the mainland would result in US participation in the conflict. The naval fighter planes under his command also provided escort for passing commercial planes. Goodwin worked together with retired Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, then-Ambassador to the Philippines, and accompanied him during the visits to Singapore, Bangkok and Saigon in January 1955.

On December 18, 1955, Goodwin's classmate Rear admiral Albert K. Morehouse, then serving as Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), died of heart attack and Goodwin was ordered to CONAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado to assume Morehouse's position. While in this capacity, he was subordinated to Army General Earle E. Partridge and was responsible for the Naval and Marine Forces allocated to the command designated for the defense of the Continental United States.

Retirement

Goodwin retired on June 1, 1957, after 40 years of active service and was advanced to the rank of Vice admiral on the retired list for having been specially commended in combat. A week later, he was invited back to his Monroe High School (now Neville High School) and handed a diploma showing that he had been graduated with the class of 1918. He then settled in Monterey, California where he taught American history at Stevenson school and was a member of the Naval Order of the United States.

Vice admiral Hugh H. Goodwin died at his home on February 25, 1980, aged 79. He was survived by his wife, Eleanor with whom he had two children, a daughter Sidney and a son Hugh Jr., who graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1948, but died one year later, when the Hellcat fighter he was piloting collided with another over the Gulf of Mexico during training.

A veteran of both World Wars, he commanded escort carrier  during the Mariana Islands campaign. Goodwin then served consecutively as Chief of Staff, Carrier Strike Group 6 and as Air Officer, Philippine Sea Frontier and participated in the Philippines campaign in the later part of the War. Although he did not complete the last year of high school, Goodwin was able to earn an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918. While at the academy, he earned a nickname ""Huge"" and among his classmates were several future admirals and generals including: Hyman G. Rickover, Milton E. Miles, Herbert S. Duckworth, James A. Riseley, Frank Peak Akers, Raymond P. Coffman, Ralph B. DeWitt, John Higgins, Vernon Huber, Albert K. Morehouse, Harold F. Pullen, Michael J. Malanaphy. Goodwin served with Carrier Division Six during the Bonin Islands raids, the naval operations at Palau and operations supporting Leyte landings in late 1944. For his service in the later part of World War II, Goodwin was decorated with Legion of Merit with Combat ""V"". He was later appointed Air Officer of the Philippine Sea Frontier under Rear admiral James L. Kauffman and remained with that command until the end of hostilities. He was responsible for the initial training of the crew and was known as a strict disciplinarian, but the crew appreciated the skills he taught them that prepared them for combat. Goodwin was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his service during the Mariana Islands campaign, and the Navy Commendation Medal for bravery in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. He died of a heart attack on December 31, 1945, in San Diego, California. He is survived by his wife, two children and a step-grandchild. He has a son and a daughter, both of whom were born in the U.S. during the 1930s. Goodwin served in the U.S. Navy during the Second World War. He was a member of the General Board of the Navy from 1950 to 1954. He served as Commander, U.s. Naval Forces in the Philippines from 1954 to 1955. Goodwin served as the Chief of Staff and Aide to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet from 1949 to 1950. He also served as Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service (MATS) from 1951 to 1953. Goodwin retired from the Navy in 1954 after the outbreak of the Korean War. Goodwin was the first member of his class to graduate from the Naval War College. He died on December 31, 1958. He is buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in San Diego, California. He has a son, Rear Admiral William P. Blandy, and a daughter, Rear admiral Mary P. Goodwin. The Goodwin family has lived in Newport, Rhode Island, since the 1950s. Goodwin is survived by his wife, Mary, and two sons, William and Robert. Hugh H. Goodwin was a vice admiral in the United States Navy. He retired in 1957 after 40 years of active service. He died on February 25, 1980, aged 79. He had two children, a daughter Sidney and a son Hugh Jr., who died in a plane crash one year after he graduated from the Naval Academy in 1948. He was a member of the Naval Order of the U.S. and the American Academy of Naval Sciences. He also served in the Army Air Force and the Air Force Reserve."

What are the three synthetic types of vitamin K?,"Vitamin K - Wikipedia

This article needs more medical references for verification or relies too heavily on primary sources. Please review the contents of the article and add the appropriate references if you can. Unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2015)
This article is about the family of vitamers. For vitamin K1 the form usually used as a supplement, see Phytomenadione.
Vitamin K structures. MK-4 and MK-7 are both subtypes of K2.
Vitamin K deficiency, Warfarin overdose
Vitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins the human body requires for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are prerequisites for blood coagulation and which the body also needs for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues. The vitamin K-related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Low levels of vitamin K also weaken bones and promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues[citation needed].
Chemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 and vitamin K2.[1] Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms.
Vitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It may be thought of as the plant form of vitamin K. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2.
Bacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into vitamin K2. In addition, bacteria typically lengthen the isoprenoid side chain of vitamin K2 to produce a range of vitamin K2 forms, most notably the MK-7 to MK-11 homologues of vitamin K2. All forms of K2 other than MK-4 can only be produced by bacteria, which use these forms in anaerobic respiration. The MK-7 and other bacterially derived forms of vitamin K2 exhibit vitamin K activity in animals, but MK-7's extra utility over MK-4, if any, is unclear and is a matter of investigation.
Three synthetic types of vitamin K are known: vitamins K3, K4, and K5. Although the natural K1 and all K2 homologues and synthetic K4 and K5 have proven nontoxic, the synthetic form K3 (menadione) has shown toxicity.[2]

11.3 Controversy
A review of 2014 concluded that there is positive evidence that monotherapy using MK-4, one of the forms of Vitamin K2, reduces fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, and suggested further research on the combined use of MK-4 with bisphosphonates. In contrast, an earlier review article of 2013 concluded that there is no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation helps prevent osteoporosis or fractures in postmenopausal women.[3]
A Cochrane systematic review of 2006 suggested that supplementation with Vitamin K1 and with MK4 reduces bone loss; in particular, a strong effect of MK-4 on incident fractures among Japanese patients was emphasized.[4]
A review article of 2016 suggested to consider, as one of several measures for bone health, increasing the intake of foods rich in vitamins K1 and K2.[5]
Cardiovascular health[edit]
Adequate intake of vitamin K is associated with the inhibition of arterial calcification and stiffening,[6] but there have been few interventional studies and no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation is of any benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.[7]
One 10-year population study, the Rotterdam Study, did show a clear and significant inverse relationship between the highest intake levels of menaquinone (mainly MK-4 from eggs and meat, and MK-8 and MK-9 from cheese) and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in older men and women.[8]
Vitamin K has been promoted in supplement form with claims it can slow tumor growth; there is however no good medical evidence that supports such claims.[9]
Coumarin poisoning[edit]
Vitamin K is part of the suggested treatment regime for poisoning by rodenticide (coumarin poisoning).[10]
Although allergic reaction from supplementation is possible, no known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K, so no tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set.[11]
Blood clotting (coagulation) studies in humans using 45 mg per day of vitamin K2 (as MK-4)[12] and even up to 135 mg per day (45 mg three times daily) of K2 (as MK-4),[13] showed no increase in blood clot risk. Even doses in rats as high as 250 mg/kg, body weight did not alter the tendency for blood-clot formation to occur.[14]
Unlike the safe natural forms of vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 and their various isomers, a synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), is demonstrably toxic at high levels. The U.S. FDA has banned this form from over-the-counter sale in the United States because large doses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells.[2]
Phylloquinone (K1)[15][16] or menaquinone (K2) are capable of reversing the anticoagulant activity of the anticoagulant warfarin (tradename Coumadin). Warfarin works by blocking recycling of vitamin K, so that the body and tissues have lower levels of active vitamin K, and thus a deficiency of vitamin K.
Supplemental vitamin K (for which oral dosing is often more active than injectable dosing in human adults) reverses the vitamin K deficiency caused by warfarin, and therefore reduces the intended anticoagulant action of warfarin and related drugs.[17] Sometimes small amounts of vitamin K are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable.[17] The proper anticoagulant action of the drug is a function of vitamin K intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient.[citation needed] The action of warfarin and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect, and neither warfarin or vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given.[18]
The newer anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have different mechanisms of action that do not interact with vitamin K, and may be taken with supplemental vitamin K.[19][20]
Vitamin K2 (menaquinone). In menaquinone, the side chain is composed of a varying number of isoprenoid residues. The most common number of these residues is four, since animal enzymes normally produce menaquinone-4 from plant phylloquinone.
A sample of phytomenadione for injection, also called phylloquinone
The three synthetic forms of vitamin K are vitamins K3 (menadione), K4, and K5, which are used in many areas, including the pet food industry (vitamin K3) and to inhibit fungal growth (vitamin K5).[21]
Conversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2[edit]
Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) – both forms of the vitamin contain a functional naphthoquinone ring and an aliphatic side chain. Phylloquinone has a phytyl side chain.
The MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls.[22] While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in germ-free rats[23][24] and in parenterally-administered K1 in rats.[25][26] In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4.[27][28] There is evidence that the conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also prenylation) to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrione) form.[29]
Vitamin K2[edit]
Main article: Vitamin K2
Vitamin K2 (menaquinone) includes several subtypes. The two subtypes most studied are menaquinone-4 (menatetrenone, MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7).
Vitamin K1, the precursor of most vitamin K in nature, is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants, where it functions as an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis. For this reason, vitamin K1 is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.). Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. The function of phylloquinone in plants appears to have no resemblance to its later metabolic and biochemical function (as ""vitamin K"") in animals, where it performs a completely different biochemical reaction.
Vitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are often (but not always) situated within specific protein domains called Gla domains. Gla residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins.[30]
At this time[update], 17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered, and they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes:
Blood coagulation: prothrombin (factor II), factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C, S, and Z[31]
Bone metabolism: osteocalcin, also called bone Gla protein (BGP), matrix Gla protein (MGP),[32] periostin,[33] and the recently discovered Gla-rich protein (GRP).[34][35]
Vascular biology: growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6)[36]
Unknown function: proline-rich γ-carboxyglutamyl proteins (PRGPs) 1 and 2, and transmembrane γ-carboxy glutamyl proteins (TMGs) 3 and 4.[37]
Like other lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D and E), vitamin K is stored in the fatty tissue of the human body.
Absorption and dietary need[edit]
Previous theory held that dietary deficiency is extremely rare unless the small intestine was heavily damaged, resulting in malabsorption of the molecule. Another at-risk group for deficiency were those subject to decreased production of K2 by normal intestinal microbiota, as seen in broad spectrum antibiotic use.[38] Taking broad-spectrum antibiotics can reduce vitamin K production in the gut by nearly 74% in people compared with those not taking these antibiotics.[39] Diets low in vitamin K also decrease the body's vitamin K concentration.[40] Those with chronic kidney disease are at risk for vitamin K deficiency, as well as vitamin D deficiency, and particularly those with the apoE4 genotype.[41] Additionally, in the elderly there is a reduction in vitamin K2 production.[42]
The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) updated an estimate of what constitutes an adequate intake (AI) for vitamin K in 2001. The NAM does not distinguish between K1 and K2 – both are counted as vitamin K. At that time there was not sufficient evidence to set the more rigorous estimated average requirement (EAR) or recommended dietary allowance (RDA) given for most of the essential vitamins and minerals. The current daily AIs for vitamin K for adult women and men are 90 μg and 120 μg respectively. The AI for pregnancy and lactation is 90 μg. For infants up to 12 months the AI is 2–2.5 μg, and for children aged 1 to 18 years the AI increases with age from 30 to 75 μg. As for safety, the FNB also sets tolerable upper intake levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of vitamin K no UL is set, as evidence for adverse effects is not sufficient. Collectively EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as dietary reference intakes.[43] The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and did not set an UL.[44]
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percentage of daily value (%DV). For vitamin K labeling purposes the daily value was 80 μg, but as of May 2016 it has been revised upwards to 120 μg. A table of the pre-change adult daily values is provided at reference daily intake. Food and supplement companies have until 28 July 2018 to comply with the change.

Vitamin K1 is found chiefly in leafy green vegetables such as dandelion greens (which contain 778.4 μg per 100 g, or 741% of the recommended daily amount), spinach, swiss chard, lettuce and Brassica vegetables (such as cabbage, kale, cauliflower, broccoli, and brussels sprouts) and often the absorption is greater when accompanied by fats such as butter or oils; some fruits, such as avocados, kiwifruit and grapes, are also high in vitamin K. By way of reference, two tablespoons of parsley contains 153% of the recommended daily amount of vitamin K.[47] Some vegetable oils, notably soybean oil, contain vitamin K, but at levels that would require relatively large calorie consumption to meet the USDA-recommended levels.[48] colonic bacteria synthesize a significant portion of humans' vitamin K needs; newborns often receive a vitamin K shot at birth to tide them over until their colons become colonized at five to seven days of age from the consumption of breast milk.
The tight binding of vitamin K1 to thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts makes it less bioavailable. For example, cooked spinach has a 5% bioavailability of phylloquinone, however, fat added to it increases bioavailability to 13% due to the increased solubility of vitamin K in fat.[49]
Main article: Vitamin K deficiency
Average diets are usually not lacking in vitamin K, and primary deficiency is rare in healthy adults. Newborn infants are at an increased risk of deficiency. Other populations with an increased prevalence of vitamin K deficiency include those who suffer from liver damage or disease (e.g. alcoholics), cystic fibrosis, or inflammatory bowel diseases, or have recently had abdominal surgeries. Secondary vitamin K deficiency can occur in people with bulimia, those on stringent diets, and those taking anticoagulants. Other drugs associated with vitamin K deficiency include salicylates, barbiturates, and cefamandole, although the mechanisms are still unknown. Vitamin K1 deficiency can result in coagulopathy, a bleeding disorder.[50]Symptoms of K1 deficiency include anemia, bruising, nosebleeds and bleeding of the gums in both sexes, and heavy menstrual bleeding in women.
Osteoporosis[51][52] and coronary heart disease[53][54] are strongly associated with lower levels of K2 (menaquinone). Vitamin K2 (as menaquinones MK-4 through MK-10) intake level is inversely related to severe aortic calcification and all-cause mortality.[8]
Function in animals[edit]
Mechanism of action of vitamin K1.
The function of vitamin K2 in the animal cell is to add a carboxylic acid functional group to a glutamate (Glu) amino acid residue in a protein, to form a gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residue. This is a somewhat uncommon posttranslational modification of the protein, which is then known as a ""Gla protein"". The presence of two −COOH (carboxylic acid) groups on the same carbon in the gamma-carboxyglutamate residue allows it to chelate calcium ions. The binding of calcium ions in this way very often triggers the function or binding of Gla-protein enzymes, such as the so-called vitamin K-dependent clotting factors discussed below.
Within the cell, vitamin K undergoes electron reduction to a reduced form called vitamin K hydroquinone, catalyzed by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR).[55] Another enzyme then oxidizes vitamin K hydroquinone to allow carboxylation of Glu to Gla; this enzyme is called gamma-glutamyl carboxylase[56][57] or the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. The carboxylation reaction only proceeds if the carboxylase enzyme is able to oxidize vitamin K hydroquinone to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The carboxylation and epoxidation reactions are said to be coupled. Vitamin K epoxide is then reconverted to vitamin K by VKOR. The reduction and subsequent reoxidation of vitamin K coupled with carboxylation of Glu is called the vitamin K cycle.[58] Humans are rarely deficient in vitamin K1 because, in part, vitamin K1 is continuously recycled in cells.[59]
Warfarin and other 4-hydroxycoumarins block the action of VKOR.[60] This results in decreased concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in tissues, such that the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by the glutamyl carboxylase is inefficient. This results in the production of clotting factors with inadequate Gla. Without Gla on the amino termini of these factors, they no longer bind stably to the blood vessel endothelium and cannot activate clotting to allow formation of a clot during tissue injury. As it is impossible to predict what dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, warfarin treatment must be carefully monitored to avoid overdose.
Gamma-carboxyglutamate proteins[edit]
Main article: Gla domain
The following human Gla-containing proteins (""Gla proteins"") have been characterized to the level of primary structure: blood coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, anticoagulant proteins C and S, and the factor X-targeting protein Z. The bone Gla protein osteocalcin, the calcification-inhibiting matrix Gla protein (MGP), the cell growth regulating growth arrest specific gene 6 protein (Gas6), and the four transmembrane Gla proteins (TMGPs), the function of which is at present unknown. Gas6 can function as a growth factor to activate the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase and stimulate cell proliferation or prevent apoptosis in some cells. In all cases in which their function was known, the presence of the Gla residues in these proteins turned out to be essential for functional activity.
Gla proteins are known to occur in a wide variety of vertebrates: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The venom of a number of Australian snakes acts by activating the human blood-clotting system. In some cases, activation is accomplished by snake Gla-containing enzymes that bind to the endothelium of human blood vessels and catalyze the conversion of procoagulant clotting factors into activated ones, leading to unwanted and potentially deadly clotting.
Another interesting class of invertebrate Gla-containing proteins is synthesized by the fish-hunting snail Conus geographus.[61] These snails produce a venom containing hundreds of neuroactive peptides, or conotoxins, which is sufficiently toxic to kill an adult human. Several of the conotoxins contain two to five Gla residues.[62]
Methods of assessment[edit]
Vitamin K status can be assessed by:
The prothrombin time (PT) test measures the time required for blood to clot. A blood sample is mixed with citric acid and put in a fibrometer; delayed clot formation indicates a deficiency. This test is insensitive to mild deficiency, as the values do not change until the concentration of prothrombin in the blood has declined by at least 50%.[63]
Undercarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II); in a study of 53 newborns, found ""PT (prothrombin time) is a less sensitive marker than PIVKA II"",[64] and as indicated above, PT is unable to detect subclinical deficiencies that can be detected with PIVKA-II testing.
Plasma phylloquinone was found to be positively correlated with phylloquinone intake in elderly British women, but not men,[65] but an article by Schurgers et al. reported no correlation between FFQ[further explanation needed] and plasma phylloquinone.[66]
Urinary γ-carboxyglutamic acid responds to changes in dietary vitamin K intake. Several days are required before any change can be observed. In a study by Booth et al., increases of phylloquinone intakes from 100 μg to between 377 and 417 μg for five days did not induce a significant change. Response may be age-specific.[67]
Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (UcOc) levels have been inversely correlated with stores of vitamin K[68] and bone strength in developing rat tibiae. Another study following 78 post-menopausal Korean women found a supplement regimen of vitamins K and D, and calcium, but not a regimen of vitamin D and calcium, was inversely correlated with reduced UcOc levels.[69]
Function in bacteria[edit]
Many bacteria, such as Escherichia coli found in the large intestine, can synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7 or MK-7, up to MK-11),[70] but not vitamin K1 (phylloquinone). In these bacteria, menaquinone transfers two electrons between two different small molecules, during oxygen-independent metabolic energy production processes (anaerobic respiration).[71] For example, a small molecule with an excess of electrons (also called an electron donor) such as lactate, formate, or NADH, with the help of an enzyme, passes two electrons to menaquinone. The menaquinone, with the help of another enzyme, then transfers these two electrons to a suitable oxidant, such fumarate or nitrate (also called an electron acceptor). Adding two electrons to fumarate or nitrate converts the molecule to succinate or nitrite plus water, respectively.
Some of these reactions generate a cellular energy source, ATP, in a manner similar to eukaryotic cell aerobic respiration, except the final electron acceptor is not molecular oxygen, but fumarate or nitrate. In aerobic respiration, the final oxidant is molecular oxygen (O2), which accepts four electrons from an electron donor such as NADH to be converted to water. E. coli, as facultative anaerobes, can carry out both aerobic respiration and menaquinone-mediated anaerobic respiration.
Injection in newborns[edit]
The blood clotting factors of newborn babies are roughly 30–60% that of adult values; this may be due to the reduced synthesis of precursor proteins and the sterility of their guts. Human milk contains 1–4 μg/L of vitamin K1, while formula-derived milk can contain up to 100 μg/L in supplemented formulas. Vitamin K2 concentrations in human milk appear to be much lower than those of vitamin K1. Occurrence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25–1.7%, with a prevalence of 2–10 cases per 100,000 births.[72] Premature babies have even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency.
Bleeding in infants due to vitamin K deficiency can be severe, leading to hospitalization, blood transfusions, brain damage, and death. Supplementation can prevent most cases of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the newborn. Intramuscular administration is more effective in preventing late vitamin K deficiency bleeding than oral administration.[73][74]
As a result of the occurrences of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended 0.5–1 mg of vitamin K1 be administered to all newborns shortly after birth.[74]
In the UK vitamin K supplementation is recommended for all newborns within the first 24 hours.[75] This is usually given as a single intramuscular injection of 1 mg shortly after birth but as a second-line option can be given by three oral doses over the first month.[76]
Controversy arose in the early 1990s regarding this practice, when two studies suggested a relationship between parenteral administration of vitamin K and childhood cancer,[77] however, poor methods and small sample sizes led to the discrediting of these studies, and a review of the evidence published in 2000 by Ross and Davies found no link between the two.[78] Doctors reported emerging concerns in 2013,[79] after treating children for serious bleeding problems. They cited lack-of newborn vitamin K administration, as the reason that the problems occurred, and recommended that breastfed babies could have an increased risk unless they receive a preventative dose.
In the early 1930s, Danish scientist Henrik Dam investigated the role of cholesterol by feeding chickens a cholesterol-depleted diet.[80] He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC).[81] McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, had used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow. They noticed that chicks fed only fat-depleted chow developed hemorrhages and started bleeding from tag sites.[82] Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that – together with the cholesterol – a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as Koagulationsvitamin. Edward Adelbert Doisy of Saint Louis University did much of the research that led to the discovery of the structure and chemical nature of vitamin K.[83] Dam and Doisy shared the 1943 Nobel Prize for medicine for their work on vitamin K (K1 and K2) published in 1939. Several laboratories synthesized the compound(s) in 1939.[84]
For several decades, the vitamin K-deficient chick model was the only method of quantifying vitamin K in various foods: the chicks were made vitamin K-deficient and subsequently fed with known amounts of vitamin K-containing food. The extent to which blood coagulation was restored by the diet was taken as a measure for its vitamin K content. Three groups of physicians independently found this: Biochemical Institute, University of Copenhagen (Dam and Johannes Glavind), University of Iowa Department of Pathology (Emory Warner, Kenneth Brinkhous, and Harry Pratt Smith), and the Mayo Clinic (Hugh Butt, Albert Snell, and Arnold Osterberg).[85]
The first published report of successful treatment with vitamin K of life-threatening hemorrhage in a jaundiced patient with prothrombin deficiency was made in 1938 by Smith, Warner, and Brinkhous.[86]
The precise function of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when three laboratories (Stenflo et al.,[87] Nelsestuen et al.,[88] and Magnusson et al.[89]) isolated the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor prothrombin (factor II) from cows that received a high dose of a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. It was shown that, while warfarin-treated cows had a form of prothrombin that contained 10 glutamate (Glu) amino acid residues near the amino terminus of this protein, the normal (untreated) cows contained 10 unusual residues that were chemically identified as γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla). The extra carboxyl group in Gla made clear that vitamin K plays a role in a carboxylation reaction during which Glu is converted into Gla.
The biochemistry of how vitamin K is used to convert Glu to Gla has been elucidated over the past thirty years in academic laboratories throughout the world.

Unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed. For vitamin K1 the form usually used as a supplement, see Phytomenadione. MK-4 and MK-7 are both subtypes of K2. Vitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2, which can only be produced by bacteria. The natural K1 and all K2 homologues and synthetic K4 and K5 have proven nontoxic, but the synthetic form K3 (menadione) has shown toxicity. A review of 2014 concluded that there is positive evidence that monotherapy using one of the forms of Vitamin K2 reduces fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis. In contrast, an earlier review article of 2013 concluded there is no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation helps prevent fractures in post menopausal women. No good evidence that vitamin K supplementation is of any benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), is demonstrably toxic at high levels. Vitamin K is part of the suggested treatment regime for poisoning by rodenticide (coumarin poisoning).[10] No known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (Vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of Vitamin K. The U.S. FDA has banned this form from over-the-counter sale in the United States because large doses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells. Sometimes small amounts of vitaminK are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable. The proper anticoagulant action is a function of vitamink intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient. The action of warfar in and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect. Neither warfarins or vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given. Vitamin K1 is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants. It is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach) It occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.) Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. Vitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins. 17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered, and they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes: blood coagulation, bone metabolism and vascular biology. Diets low in vitamin K also decrease the body's vitamin K concentration. Those with chronic kidney disease are at risk for vitamin K deficiency, as well as vitamin D deficiency, and particularly those with the apoE4 genotype. The National Academy of Medicine updated an estimate of what constitutes an adequate intake of vitamin K in 2001. Vitamin K1 is found chiefly in leafy green vegetables such as dandelion greens, spinach, swiss chard, lettuce and Brassica vegetables. Vitamin K1 deficiency can result in coagulopathy, a bleeding disorder. Secondary vitamin K deficiency can occur in people with bulimia, those on stringent diets, and those taking anticoagulants. Osteoporosis[51] and coronary heart disease are strongly associated with lower levels of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) Vitamin K2 intake level is inversely related to severe aortic calcification and all-cause mortality.[8]Function in animals is to add a carboxylic acid functional group to a glutamate (Glu) amino acid residue in a animal cell. This is a somewhat uncommon modification of the protein, which is then known as a post-translational modification. The presence of two protein groups on the same carb is known as the ""COOH"" (carboxyl acid) effect. For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percentage of daily value (%DV) For vitamin K labeling purposes the daily value was 80 μg, but as of May 2016 it has been revised upwards to 120 μg. Gla proteins are known to occur in a wide variety of vertebrates: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The venom of a number of Australian snakes acts by activating the human blood-clotting system. In some cases, activation is accomplished by snake Gla-containing enzymes that bind to the endothelium of human blood vessels and catalyze the conversion of procoagulant clotting factors into activated ones. Warfarin and other 4-hydroxycoumarins block the action of VKOR. This results in decreased concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in tissues. It is impossible to predict what dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, so it must be carefully monitored to avoid overdose. The prothrombin time (PT) test measures the time required for blood to clot. A blood sample is mixed with citric acid and put in a fibrometer. This test is insensitive to mild deficiency, as the values do not change until the blood has declined at least 50%.[63] In a study of 53 newborns, 53% found ""prothrom bin time"" to be less than 53 seconds. Plasma phylloquinone was found to be positively correlated with vitamin K intake in elderly British women, but not men. Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (UcOc) levels have been inversely correlated with stores of vitamin K and bone strength in developing rat tibiae. The blood clotting factors of newborn babies are roughly 30–60% that of adult values. Vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25–1.7%, with a prevalence of 2–10 cases per 100,000 births. Premature babies have even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency. Supplementation is recommended for all newborns within the first 24 hours of birth. Intramuscular administration is more effective in preventing late vitamin K deficiency bleed than oral administration. The Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended 0.5–1 mg of vitamins K1 be administered to all newbornS shortly after birth. This single intramususus is usually given as a second-line injection of 1 mg over the first month of life. In the early 1930s, Danish scientist Henrik Dam investigated the role of cholesterol by feeding chickens a cholesterol-depleted diet. Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that – together with the cholesterol – a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. Several laboratories synthesized the compound(s) in 1939. The precise function of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when three laboratories (Stenflo et al.,[87] Nelsestuen et al. and Magnusson et al.) isolated the vitamin K-dependent coagulating factor prothrombin (factor II) from cows that received a high dose of a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. The extra carboxyl group in Gla made clear that vitamin K plays a role in a carboxyglutamate reaction during which Glu is converted into Gla. The biochemistry of how vitamin K is used to convert Glu to Gla has been elucidated over the past thirty years in academic laboratories throughout the world. Vitamin K has been linked to a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. Vitamin K administration to elderly patients with osteoporosis induces no hemostatic activation, even in those with suspected vitamin K deficiency. The American Cancer Society has a guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies (2nd ed.) with information on vitamin K and other minerals. The National Institutes of Health has a program to promote vitamin K use in the U.S. and abroad. The U.N. International Agency for Research on Cancer has a programme to promote the use of vitamin K in the treatment of cancer and other cancer-causing conditions. The World Health Organization has a Program to promote Vitamin K use. The European Food Standards Agency has a Programme to Promote Vitamin K Use in the Treatment of Cancer and Other Conditions. The International Organization for Vitamin K is a not-for-profit organization that promotes vitamin K usage in the United States and other countries. It also provides information on Vitamin K-rich foods and supplements for cancer patients and their families. For more information about vitamin K, visit: www.vitamink.org.uk/.

abstract

Indenofluorenes are non-benzenoid conjugated hydrocarbons that have received great interest owing to their unusual electronic structure and potential applications in nonlinear optics and photovoltaics. Here, we report the generation of unsubstituted indeno[1,2-a]fluorene, the final and yet unreported parent indenofluorene regioisomer, on various surfaces by cleavage of two C-H bonds in 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene through voltage pulses applied by the tip of a combined scanning tunneling microscope and atomic force microscope.
On bilayer NaCl on Au(111), indeno[1,2a]fluorene is in the neutral charge state, while it exhibits charge bistability between neutral and anionic states on the lower work function surfaces of bilayer NaCl on Ag(111) and Cu(111). In the neutral state, indeno[1,2-a]fluorene exhibits either of two ground states: an open-shell π-diradical state, predicted to be a triplet by density functional and multireference many-body perturbation theory calculations, or a closedshell state with a para-quinodimethane moiety in the as-indacene core.
Switching between open-and closed-shell states of a single molecule is observed by changing its adsorption site on NaCl. The inclusion of non-benzenoid carbocyclic rings is a viable route to tune the physicochemical properties of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) . Non-benzenoid polycycles may lead to local changes in strain, conjugation, aromaticity, and, relevant to the context of the present work, induce an open-shell ground state of the corresponding PCHs .
Many nonbenzenoid PCHs are also non-alternant, where the presence of odd-membered polycycles breaks the bipartite symmetry of the molecular network . Figure shows classical examples of non-benzenoid non-alternant PCHs, namely, pentalene, azulene and heptalene. Whereas azulene is a stable PCH exhibiting Hückel aromaticity ([4n+2] π-electrons, n = 2), pentalene and heptalene are unstable Hückel antiaromatic compounds with [4n] π-electrons, n = 2 (pentalene) and n = 3 (heptalene).
Benzinterposition of pentalene generates indacenes, consisting of two isomers s-indacene and as-indacene (Fig. ). Apart from being antiaromatic, indacenes also contain proaromatic quinodimethane (QDM) moieties (Fig. ) , which endows them with potential open-shell character. While the parent s-indacene and asindacene have never been isolated, stable derivatives of s-indacene bearing bulky substituents have been synthesized .
A feasible strategy to isolate congeners of otherwise unstable non-benzenoid non-alternant PCHs is through fusion of benzenoid rings at the ends of the π-system, that is, benzannelation. For example, while the parent pentalene is unstable, the benzannelated congener indeno[2,1-a]indene is stable under ambient conditions (Fig. ) .
However, the position of benzannelation is crucial for stability: although indeno[2,1a]indene is stable, its regioisomer indeno[1,2-a]indene (Fig. ) oxidizes under ambient conditions . Similarly, benzannelation of indacenes gives rise to the family of PCHs known as indenofluorenes (Fig. ), which constitute the topic of the present work.
Depending on the benzannelation position and the indacene core, five regioisomers can be constructed, namely, indeno [ Practical interest in indenofluorenes stems from their low frontier orbital gap and excellent electrochemical characteristics that render them as useful components in organic electronic devices .
The potential open-shell character of indenofluorenes has led to several theoretical studies on their use as non-linear optical materials and as candidates for singlet fission in organic photovoltaics . Recent theoretical work has also shown that indenofluorene-based ladder polymers may exhibit fractionalized excitations.
Fundamentally, indenofluorenes represent model systems to study the interplay between aromaticity and magnetism at the molecular scale . Motivated by many of these prospects, the last decade has witnessed intensive synthetic efforts toward the realization of indenofluorenes. Derivatives of 1-4 have been realized in solution , while 1-3 have also been synthesized on surfaces and characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), which provide information on molecular orbital densities , molecular structure and oxidation state .
With regards to the open-shell character of indenofluorenes, 2-4 are theoretically and experimentally interpreted to be closed-shell, while calculations indicate that 1 and 5 should exhibit open-shell ground states . Bulk characterization of mesitylsubstituted 1, including X-ray crystallography, temperature-dependent NMR, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy, provided indications of its open-shell ground state .
Electronic characterization of 1 on Au(111) surface using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) revealed a low electronic gap of 0.4 eV (ref. ). However, no experimental proof of an openshell ground state of 1 on Au(111), such as detection of singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) or spin excitations and correlations due to unpaired electrons , was shown.
In this work, we report the generation and characterization of unsubstituted 5. Our research is motivated by theoretical calculations that indicate 5 to exhibit the largest diradical character among all indenofluorene isomers . The same calculations also predict that 5 should possess a triplet ground state.
Therefore, 5 would qualify as a Kekulé triplet, of which only a handful of examples exist . However, definitive synthesis of 5 has never been reported so far. Previously, Dressler et al. reported transient isolation of mesityl-substituted 5, where it decomposed both in the solution and in solid state , and only the structural proof of the corresponding dianion was obtained.
On-surface generation of a derivative of 5, starting from truxene as a precursor, was recently reported . STM data on this compound, containing the indeno[1,2-a]fluorene moiety as part of a larger PCH, was interpreted to indicate its open-shell ground state. However, the results did not imply the ground state of unsubstituted 5. Here, we show that on insulating surfaces 5 can exhibit either of two ground states: an open-shell or a closed-shell.
We infer the existence of these two ground states based on high-resolution AFM imaging with bond-order discrimination and STM imaging of molecular orbital densities . AFM imaging reveals molecules with two different geometries. Characteristic bond-order differences in the two geometries concur with the geometry of either an open-or a closed-shell state.
Concurrently, STM images at ionic resonances show molecular orbital densities corresponding to SOMOs for the open-shell geometry, but orbital densities of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for the closed-shell geometry. Our experimental results are in good agreement with density functional theory (DFT) and multireference perturbation theory calculations.
Finally, we observe switching between open-and closed-shell states of a single molecule by changing its adsorption site on the surface. Synthetic strategy toward indeno[1,2-a]fluorene. The generation of 5 relies on the solution-phase synthesis of the precursor 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (6). Details on synthesis and characterization of 6 are reported in Supplementary Figs.
. Single molecules of 6 are deposited on coinage metal (Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111)) or insulator surfaces. In our work, insulating surfaces correspond to two monolayer-thick (denoted as bilayer) NaCl on coinage metal surfaces. Voltage pulses ranging between 4-6 V are applied by the tip of a combined STM/AFM system, which result in cleavage of one C-H bond at each of the pentagonal apices of 6, thereby leading to the generation of 5 (Fig. ).
In the main text, we focus on the generation and characterization of 5 on insulating surfaces. Generation and characterization of 5 on coinage metal surfaces is shown in Supplementary Fig. . ).

The bright and dark features in the trilayer NaCl island in g correspond to Cl -and Na + ions, respectively.
Scale bars: 10 Å (f) and 5 Å (g). To experimentally explore the electronic structure of 5, we used bilayer NaCl films on coinage metal surfaces to electronically decouple the molecule from the metal surfaces. Before presenting the experimental findings, we summarize the results of our theoretical calculations performed on 5 in the neutral charge state (denoted as 5 0 ).
We start by performing DFT calculations on 5 0 in the gas phase. Geometry optimization performed at the spin-unrestricted UB3LYP/6-31G level of theory leads to one local minimum, 5OS, the geometry of which corresponds to the open-shell resonance structure of 5 (Fig. , the label OS denotes open-shell).
The triplet electronic configuration of 5OS is the lowest-energy state, with the openshell singlet configuration 90 meV higher in energy. Geometry optimization performed at the restricted closed-shell RB3LYP/6-31G level reveals two local minima, 5para and 5ortho, the geometries of which (Fig. ) exhibit bond length alternations in line with the presence of a para-or an ortho-QDM moiety, respectively, in the as-indacene core of the closed-shell resonance structures of 5 (Fig. ) .
Relative to 5OS in the triplet configuration, 5para and 5ortho are 0.40 and 0.43 eV higher in energy, respectively. Additional DFT results are shown in Supplementary Fig. . To gain more accurate insights into the theoretical electronic structure of 5, we performed multireference perturbation theory calculations (Supplementary Fig. ) based on quasi-degenerate second-order n-electron valence state perturbation theory (QD-NEVPT2).
In so far as the order of the ground and excited states are concerned, the results of QD-NEVPT2 calculations qualitatively match with DFT calculations. For 5OS, the triplet configuration remains the lowest-energy state, with the open-shell singlet configuration 60 meV higher in energy. The energy differences between the open-and closed-shell states are substantially reduced in QD-NEVPT2 calculations, with 5para and 5ortho only 0.11 and 0.21 eV higher in energy, respectively, compared to 5OS in the triplet configuration.
We also performed nucleus-independent chemical shift calculations to probe local aromaticity of 5 in the openand closed-shell states. While 5OS in the triplet configuration exhibits local aromaticity at the terminal benzenoid rings, 5OS in the open-shell singlet configuration, 5para and 5ortho all display antiaromaticity (Supplementary Fig. ).
The choice of the insulating surface determines the charge state of 5: while 5 adopts neutral charge state on the high work function bilayer NaCl/Au(111) surface (irrespective of its openor closed-shell state, Supplementary Fig. ), 5 exhibits charge bistability between 5 0 and the anionic state 5 -1 on the lower work function bilayer NaCl/Ag(111) and Cu(111) surfaces (Supplementary Figs. ).
In the main text, we focus on the characterization of 5 on bilayer NaCl/Au(111). Characterization of charge bistable 5 is reported in Supplementary Figs. . We first describe experiments on 5 on bilayer NaCl/Au(111), where 5 exhibits a geometry corresponding to the calculated 5OS geometry, and an open-shell electronic configuration.
We compare the experimental data on this species to calculations on 5OS with a triplet configuration, as theory predicts a triplet ground state for 5OS. For 5OS, the calculated frontier orbitals correspond to the SOMOs ψ1 and ψ2 (Fig. ), whose spin up levels are occupied and the spin down levels are empty.
Figure shows the DFT-calculated bond lengths of 5OS, where the two salient features, namely, the small difference in the bond lengths within each ring and the notably longer bond lengths in the pentagonal rings, agree with the open-shell resonance structure of 5 (Fig. ). Figure shows an AFM image of 5 adsorbed on bilayer NaCl/Au(111) that we assign as 5OS, where the bond-order differences qualitatively correspond to the calculated 5OS geometry (discussed and compared to the closed-shell state below).
Differential conductance spectra (dI/dV(V), where I and V denote the tunneling current and bias voltage, respectively) acquired on assigned 5OS exhibit two peaks centered at -1.5 V and 1.6 V (Fig. ), which we assign to the positive and negative ion resonances (PIR and NIR), respectively. Figure shows the corresponding STM images acquired at the onset (V = -1.2
V/1.3 V) and the peak (V = -1.5 V/1.6 V) of the ionic resonances. To draw a correspondence between the STM images and the molecular orbital densities, we consider tunneling events as many-body electronic transitions between different charge states of 5OS (Fig. ). Within this framework, the PIR corresponds to transitions between 5 0 and the cationic state 5 .
At the onset of the PIR at -1.2 V, an electron can only be detached from the SOMO ψ1 and the corresponding STM image at -1.2 V shows the orbital density of ψ1. Increasing the bias to the peak of the PIR at -1.5 V, it becomes possible to also empty the SOMO ψ2, such that the corresponding STM image shows the superposition of ψ1 and ψ2, that is, |ψ1| 2 + |ψ2| 2 (ref.
). Similarly, the NIR corresponds to transitions between 5 0 and 5 -1 . At the NIR onset of 1.3 V, only electron attachment to ψ2 is energetically possible. At 1.6 V, electron attachment to ψ1 also becomes possible, and the corresponding STM image shows the superposition of ψ1 and ψ2. The observation of the orbital densities of SOMOs, and not the hybridized HOMO and LUMO, proves the open-shell ground state of assigned 5OS.
Measurements of the monoradical species with a doublet ground state are shown in Supplementary Fig. . Unexpectedly, another species of 5 was also experimentally observed that exhibited a closedshell ground state. In contrast to 5OS, where the frontier orbitals correspond to the SOMOs ψ1 and ψ2, DFT calculations predict orbitals of different shapes and symmetries for 5para and 5ortho, denoted as α and β and shown in Fig. .
For 5ortho, α and β correspond to HOMO and LUMO, respectively. The orbitals are inverted in energy and occupation for 5para, where β is the HOMO and α is the LUMO. Fig. shows an AFM image of 5 that we assign as 5para. We experimentally infer its closed-shell state first by using qualitative bond order discrimination by AFM.
In high-resolution AFM imaging, chemical bonds with higher bond order are imaged brighter (that is, with higher frequency shift Δf) due to stronger repulsive forces, and they appear shorter . In Fig. , we label seven bonds whose bond orders show significant qualitative differences in the calculated 5ortho, 5para (Fig. ) and 5OS (Fig. ) geometries.
In 5para, the bonds b and d exhibit a higher bond order than a and c, respectively. This pattern is reversed for 5ortho, while the bond orders of the bonds a-d are all similar and small for 5OS. Furthermore, in 5para bond f exhibits a higher bond order than e, while in 5ortho and 5OS bonds e and f exhibit similar bond order (because they belong to Clar sextets).
Finally, the bond labeled g shows a higher bond order in 5para than in 5ortho and 5OS. The AFM image of assigned 5para shown in Fig. indicates higher bond orders of the bonds b, d and f compared to a, c and e, respectively. In addition, the bond g appears almost point-like and with enhanced Δf contrast compared to its neighboring bonds, indicative of a high bond order (see Supplementary Fig. for height-dependent measurements).
These observations concur with the calculated 5para geometry (Fig. ). Importantly, all these distinguishing bond-order differences are distinctly different in the AFM image of 5OS shown in Fig. , which is consistent with the calculated 5OS geometry (Fig. ). In the AFM images of 5OS (Fig. and Supplementary Fig. ), the bonds a-d at the pentagon apices appear with similar contrast and apparent bond length.
The bonds e and f at one of the terminal benzenoid rings also exhibit similar contrast and apparent bond length, while the central bond g appears longer compared to assigned 5para. Further compelling evidence for the closed-shell state of assigned 5para is obtained by STM and STS. dI/dV(V) spectra acquired on an assigned 5para species exhibit two peaks centered at -1.4 V (PIR) and 1.6 V (NIR) (Fig. ).
STM images acquired at these biases (Fig. ) show the orbital densities of β (-1.4 V) and α (1.6 V). First, the observation of α and β as the frontier orbitals of this species, and not the SOMOs, strongly indicates its closed-shell state. Second, consistent with AFM measurements that indicate good correspondence to the calculated 5para geometry, we observe β as the HOMO and α as the LUMO.
For 5ortho, α should be observed as the HOMO and β as the LUMO. We did not observe molecules with the signatures of 5ortho in our experiments. We observed molecules in open-(5OS, Fig. ) and closed-shell (5para, Fig. ) states in similar occurrence after their generation from 6 on the surface. We could also switch individual molecules between open-and closed-shell states as shown in Fig. and Supplementary Fig. .
To this end, a change in the adsorption site of a molecule was induced by STM imaging at ionic resonances, which often resulted in movement of the molecule. The example presented in Fig. shows a molecule that was switched from 5para to 5OS and back to 5para. The switching is not directed, that is, we cannot choose which of the two species will be formed when changing the adsorption site, and we observed 5OS and 5para in approximately equal yields upon changing the adsorption site.
The molecule in Fig. is adsorbed on top of a defect that stabilizes its adsorption geometry on bilayer NaCl. At defect-free adsorption sites on bilayer NaCl, that is, without a third layer NaCl island or atomic defects in the vicinity of the molecule, 5 could be stably imaged neither by AFM nor by STM at ionic resonances (Supplementary Fig. ).
Without changing the adsorption site, the state of 5 (open-or closedshell) never changed, including the experiments on bilayer NaCl/Ag(111) and Cu(111), on which the charge state of 5 could be switched (Supplementary Figs. ). Also on these lower work function surfaces, both open-and closed-shell species were observed for 5 0 and both showed charge bistability between 5 0 (5OS or 5para) and 5 -1 (Supplementary Figs. ).
The geometrical structure of 5 -1 probed by AFM, and its electronic structure probed by STM imaging at the NIR (corresponding to transitions between 5 -1 and the dianionic state 5 -2 ), are identical within the measurement accuracy for the charged species of both 5OS and 5para. When cycling the charge state of 5 between 5 0 and 5 -1 several times, we always observed the same state (5OS or 5para) when returning to 5 0 , provided the molecule did not move during the charging/discharging process.
Based on our experimental observations we conclude that indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (5), the last unknown indenofluorene isomer, can be stabilized in and switched between an open-shell (5OS) and a closed-shell (5para) state on NaCl. For the former, both DFT and QD-NEVPT2 calculations predict a triplet electronic configuration.
Therefore, 5 can be considered to exhibit the spin-crossover effect, involving magnetic switching between high-spin (5OS) and low-spin (5para) states, coupled with a reversible structural transformation. So far, the spin-crossover effect has mainly only been observed in transition-metal-based coordination compounds with a near-octahedral geometry .
The observation that the switching between open-and closedshell states is related to changes in the adsorption site but is not achieved by charge-state cycling alone, indicates that the NaCl surface and local defects facilitate different electronic configurations of 5 depending on the adsorption site.
Gas-phase QD-NEVPT2 calculations predict that 5OS is the ground state, and the closed-shell 5para and 5ortho states are 0.11 and 0.21 eV higher in energy. The experiments, showing bidirectional switching between 5OS and 5para, indicate that a change in the adsorption site can induce sufficient change in the geometry of 5 (leading to a corresponding change in the ground state electronic configuration) and thus induce switching.
Switching between open-and closed-shell states in 5 does not require the breaking or formation of covalent bonds , but a change of adsorption site on NaCl where the molecule is physisorbed. Our results should have implications for single-molecule devices, capitalizing on the altered electronic and chemical properties of a system in π-diradical open-shell and closed-shell states such as frontier orbital and singlet-triplet gaps, and chemical reactivity.
For possible future applications as a single-molecule switch, it might be possible to also switch between open-and closed-shell states by changing the local electric field, such as by using chargeable adsorbates . Scanning probe microscopy measurements and sample preparation. STM and AFM measurements were performed in a home-built system operating at base pressures below 1×10 -10 mbar and a base temperature of 5 K. Bias voltages are provided with respect to the sample.
All STM, AFM and spectroscopy measurements were performed with carbon monoxide (CO) functionalized tips. AFM measurements were performed in non-contact mode with a qPlus sensor . The sensor was operated in frequency modulation mode with a constant oscillation amplitude of 0.5 Å. STM measurements were performed in constantcurrent mode, AFM measurements were performed in constant-height mode with V = 0 V, and I(V) and Δf(V) spectra were acquired in constant-height mode.
Positive (negative) values of the tip-height offset Δz represent tip approach (retraction) from the STM setpoint. All dI/dV(V) spectra are obtained by numerical differentiation of the corresponding I(V) spectra. STM and AFM images, and spectroscopy curves, were post-processed using Gaussian low-pass filters.
Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111) surfaces were cleaned by iterative cycles of sputtering with Ne + ions and annealing up to 800 K. NaCl was thermally evaporated on Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111) surfaces held at 323 K, 303 K and 283 K, respectively. This protocol results in the growth of predominantly bilayer (100)-terminated islands, with a minority of trilayer islands.
Sub-monolayer coverage of 6 on surfaces was obtained by flashing an oxidized silicon wafer containing the precursor molecules in front of the cold sample in the microscope. CO molecules for tip functionalization were dosed from the gas phase on the cold sample. Density functional theory calculations. DFT was employed using the PSI4 program package .
All molecules with different charge (neutral and anionic) and electronic (open-and closed-shell) states were independently investigated in the gas phase. The B3LYP exchangecorrelation functional with 6-31G basis set was employed for structural relaxation and singlepoint energy calculations. The convergence criteria were set to 10 −4 eV Å −1 for the total forces and 10 −6 eV for the total energies.
Multireference calculations. Multireference calculations were performed on the DFToptimized geometries using the QD-NEVPT2 level of theory , with three singlet roots and one triplet root included in the state-averaged calculation. A (10,10) active space (that is, 10 electrons in 10 orbitals) was used along with the def2-TZVP basis set .
Increasing either the active space size or expanding the basis set resulted in changes of about 50 meV for relative energies of the singlet and triplet states. These calculations were performed using the ORCA program package . Nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. Isotropic nucleus-independent chemical shift values were evaluated at the centre of each ring using the B3LYP exchangecorrelation functional with def2-TZVP basis set using the Gaussian 16 software package .
Starting materials (reagent grade) were purchased from TCI and Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Reactions were carried out in flame-dried glassware and under an inert atmosphere of purified Ar using Schlenk techniques. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Silica Gel 60 F-254 plates (Merck).
Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (40-60 µm). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Varian Mercury 300 or Bruker Varian Inova 500 spectrometers. Mass spectrometry (MS) data were recorded in a Bruker Micro-TOF spectrometer. The synthesis of compound 6 was developed following the two-step synthetic route shown in Supplementary Fig. , which is based on the preparation of methylene-bridge polyarenes by means of Pd-catalyzed activation of benzylic C-H bonds .
Supplementary Figure | Synthetic route to obtain compound 6. The complex Pd2(dba)3 (20 mg, 0.02 mmol) was added over a deoxygenated mixture of 1,3-dibromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene (9, 100 mg, 0.38 mmol), boronic acid 10 (178 mg, 1.14 mmol), K2CO3 (314 mg, 2.28 mmol) and XPhos (35 mg, 0.08 mmol) in toluene (1:1, 10 mL), and the resulting mixture was heated at 90 °C for 2 h.
After cooling to room temperature, the solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure. The reaction crude was purified by column chromatography (SiO2; hexane:CH2Cl2 9:1) affording 11 (94 mg, 76%) as a colorless oil. The complex Pd(OAc)2 (7 mg, 0.03 mmol) was added over a deoxygenated mixture of terphenyl 11 (90 mg, 0.27 mmol), K2CO3 (114 mg, 0.83 mmol) and ligand L (26 mg, 0.06 mmol) in NMP (2 mL).
The resulting mixture was heated at 160 °C for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, H2O (30 mL) was added, and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3x15 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The reaction crude was purified by column chromatography (SiO2; hexane:CH2Cl2 9:1) affording compound 6 (8 mg, 11%) as a white solid. in AFM imaging due to their reduced adsorption height compared to the rest of the carbon atoms.
We attribute this observation to the significantly different lattice parameter of Cu(111) (2.57 Å) compared to Au(111) and Ag(111) (2.95 Å and 2.94 Å, respectively) , such that the apical carbon atoms of the pentagonal rings of 5 adsorb on the on-top atomic sites on Au(111) and Ag(111), but not on Cu(111).
Our speculation is based on a previous study of polymers of 1 on Au(111) by Di Giovannantonio et al. , where both tilted and planar individual units of 1 were observed depending on whether the apical carbon atoms of the pentagonal rings in 1 adsorbed on the on-top or hollow sites of the surface, respectively.
Given the strong molecule-metal interaction, we found no electronic state signatures of 5 on all three metal surfaces. STM set point for AFM images: V = 0. e, Frontier orbital spectrum of 5 -1 .

Indenofluorenes represent model systems to study the interplay between aromaticity and magnetism at the molecular scale. Derivatives of 1-4 have been realized in solution, while 1-3 have also been synthesized on surfaces and characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy. calculations indicate that 1 and 5 should exhibit open- shell ground states. Our research is motivated by theoretical studies on their use as non-linear optical materials and as candidates for singlet fission in organic photovoltaics. We report the generation and characterization of unsubstituted 5 to exhibit thinnest, least dense, and most stable open-Shell ground states of the 5th generation of P CHs. We conclude with a discussion of the potential uses of indenofLUorenes in organic electronic devices and nanomaterials, such as solar cells, batteries, LEDs, and photodiodes, as well as in the development of new materials. On insulating surfaces 5 can exhibit either of two ground states: an open-shell or a closed-shell. AFM imaging reveals molecules with two different geometries. Our experimental results are in good agreement with density functional theory (DFT) and multireference perturbation theory calculations. The generation of 5 relies on the solution-phase synthesis of the precursor 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (6). Details on synthesis and characterization of 6 are reported in Supplementary Figs. 1-3. We observe switching between open-and closed- shell states of a single molecule by changing its adsorption site on the surface. The tip-height offset for each molecule is provided with respect to the STM setpoint, and positive (negative) values of the tip approach are shown for each species of 5 assigned as 5OS. In our work, insulating. surfaces correspond to two monolayer-thick (denoted as bilayer) NaCl on coinage metal surfaces. Blue and orange colors represent spin up and spin down densities, respectively. The bright and dark features in the trilayer NaCl island show the same island in the same trilayers. 5 adopts neutral charge state on the high work function bilayer NaCl/Au(111) surface. 5 exhibits charge bistability between 5 0 and the anionic state 5 -1 on the lower work function BilayerNaCl/Ag(111), Cu(111). 5 exhibits bond length alternations in line with the presence of a para-or an ortho-QDM moiety in the as-indacene core of the closed-shell resonance structures of 5 (Fig. ) The triplet electronic configuration of 5OS is the lowest-energy state, with the openshell singlet configuration 90 meV higher in energy. 5OS in the triplet configuration exhibits local aromaticity at the terminal benzenoid rings, while 5para and 5ortho all display antiaromaticity (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). The choice of the insulating surface determines the charge state of 5. We first describe experiments on 5 on bilayer naCl/au( 111), where 5 exhibits a geometry corresponding to the calculated 5OS geometry, and an open-shell electronic configuration. We compare the experimental data on this species to calculations on 5OS with a triplet configurations, as theory predicts a tripleT ground state for 5OS.  conductance spectra (dI/dV(V), where I and V denote the tunneling current and bias voltage, respectively) acquired on assigned 5OS exhibit two peaks centered at -1.5 V and 1.6 V. To draw a correspondence between the STM images and the molecular orbital densities, we consider tunneling events as many-body electronic transitions between different charge states of 5OS. Unexpectedly, another species of 5 was also experimentally observed that exhibited a closedshell ground state. We experimentally infer its closed-shell state first by using qualitative bond order discrimination by AFM. In 5para, the bonds b and d exhibit a higher bond order than a and c, respectively. This pattern is reversed for 5ortho, while the bond orders of the bonds a-d are all similar and small for 5 OS. Furthermore, the bond labeled g appears almost point-like and with enhanced Δf contrast compared to its neighboring bonds, indicative of a high bond order for height-dependent measurements. These observations concur with the calculated 5 para geometry (Fig. 1) which is consistent with the 5OS geometry ( Fig. 2) The bonds e and f exhibit similar apparent length and contrast at one terminal benzenoid rings, while t-d at the pentagon apices appear with similar contrast. The geometrical structure of 5 -1 probed by AFM and its electronic structure probed. by STM imaging at the NIR are identical within the measurement accuracy for the charged species of 5OS and 5para. When cycling the charge state of 5 between 5 0 and 5 - 1 several times, we always observed the same state when returning to 5 0. The switching is not directed, that is, we cannot choose which of the two species will be formed when changing the adsorption site. 5 can be considered to exhibit the spin-crossover effect, involving magnetic switching between high-spin (5OS) and low-spin. (5para) states, coupled with a reversible structural transformation. We conclude that indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (5), the last unknown indenofluorene isomer, can be stabilized in and switched between an open-shell (5 OS) and a closed- shell (5 para) state on NaCl. The observation that the switching between open-and closedshell states is not achieved by charge-state cycling alone, indicates that the NaCl surface and local defects of 5 facilitate different configurations of 5. Gas-phase QD-NEVPT2 calculations predict that 5OS is the ground state. Switching between open-and closed-shell states in 5 does not require the breaking or formation of covalent bonds. A change of adsorption site on NaCl where the molecule is physisorbed. Our results should have implications for single-molecule devices, capitalizing on the altered electronic and chemical properties of a system in π-diradical open-shell and closed- shell states. For possible future applications, it might be possible to switch between open and closed states by changing the local electric field, such as by using chargeable adsorbates.

What field does Danny work in in Tennessee?,"My Aspergers Child: COMMENTS & QUESTIONS [for Feb., 2017]
I emailed you a while back and you mentioned that I could email when I needed to. Thank you. I last wrote you in December that my son became involved in a dispute involving the local police. We have had 3 court dates. It keeps delaying due to not being able to come to an agreement. But the attorney, even though he was just vaguely familiar with Aspergers, has been very good with Craig. He has the compassion and excellence that is needed here. What started out very bad is turning into a good thing. It will probably take another 90 days or more.
But Craig is working hard. Too hard sometimes. He goes to therapy 3 times a week. Doing excellent. He's more focused and can calm down easier. He's got a lot on his plate but has support from his family. From his attorney. From therapy. And from his work.
He has been renting a room from a lady who has a son with ADHD. It is good for him. I'm a little worried though because since she smokes he wants to find his own place. With all the costs he has to balance it out financially. That is good. I can't help him more than I am which is good. He is stepping up and taking responsibility. He is listening much better.
He is going to have an evaluation today to get an accurate diagnosis. I understand that is a little difficult since he is an adult. Also the PTSD may cover it over. The attorney stated it would help to have the diagnosis.
Aware this is a long update, but thanks for reading. I am fighting much guilt still but I have a lot of peace now. My daughter and her 4 year old son also have Aspergers symptoms. So my life chapters may not close for a while. :-)
My name is Mac. I'm sure you're quite busy, so I'll get right to it I just wanted to pass on compliments on My Aspergers Child and your post, How to Implement the GFCF Diet: Tips for Parents of Autistic Children.
Me and my wife absolutely loved it!
I got a facebook message from him today begging to be able to come home saying he misses home and he will change. He says he will follow rules now. I stated to him the simple rules he has to follow which were - No weed in my house, or smoked in my house, coming home at curfew, going to school, no skipping, no drugs at school, and to drop the attitude of I am 17 I can do whatever I want.
I have made it very clear that if I see any drugs in my home I will be calling the police, as well as if I see signs of it being sold by him I will report him. (He has never had selling amounts in my house, ... I believe it's being kept at his ""friends"" which of course I have no proof of....I just know it is not here.
I know my battle is not over by a long shot, I am sure we will have more consequences and possibly another being kicked out, but I am going to think positive and hope that he learned some form of a valuable lesson here.
Thank you so much for the guidance, never in a million years did I ever think I'd be on this side, (the one needing the help, as I am the one who helps.)
I am going to go back to the start of the program like I said earlier and keep notes close by for reference.
Thanks for all you do, helping us all with ODD children/teens
I have a small company providing educational support services to a few families who have children with various disabilities in Ohio. One of the families has multiple adopted children of whom several have significant attachment disorders including RAD. As an experienced teacher and foster parent I have some experience in working with children who have extensive trauma backgrounds. However, I could use additional training. Also working with these children are two staff members with minimal background in attachment disorders who would also benefit from training primarily in behavior management. The primary caregiver to the children does a wonderful job managing their needs. In order to further develop team cohesion, I'm hoping to include her in any training as well.
Is it possible to schedule such a training session with you? If so, please let us know what will work for you including time, place, and cost. Thank you for your assistance.
I just listed to your tapes on dealing with an out of control, defiant teen. I'd like to ask your advice on a particular situation we have. Our 15 year old daughter is smoking pot almost every day at school. Because we had no way to control the situation, we told her, fine, go ahead and smoke weed. However, you will no longer receive the same support from us. You will not have your phone, lunch money to go off campus (she has an account at the school for the cafeteria she can use), and you will be grounded until you can pass a drug test. We will not be testing you except for when you tell us you are ready to be tested. She is now saying she's suicidal because she feels so isolated, yet she continues to smoke weed. In fact, she tried to sneak out last night but was foiled by our alarm system. For the particular drug test we have, I read it takes about 10 days of not smoking to pass the test. What would you do? Please advise.
I am having a problem with my 18 year old son, Danny, with high functioning autism. We finally had him diagnosed when he was 16 years old. I always knew something was going on with him but the doctors misdiagnosed him as bipolar. It's been 2 years now and he will not accept his diagnosis. He won't talk about it and when I try to bring it up he gets very angry. I've tried telling him that it's not a bad thing, that there's been many, many very successful people with Aspergers. He won't tell anyone and refuses to learn about managing life with it. He once shared with me that the other kids at school use it as an insult, like saying someone is so autistic when they do something they don't approve of. So he doesn't want anyone to know. He's turned down services that could help him. He has a girlfriend, going on 8 months. He won't tell her and they're having problems arguing a lot and I wonder if it would help for her to know.
I'm sad that he thinks it's a life sentence to something horrible instead of accepting, embracing it and learning about it more so he maybe can understand why he's struggling. I told him that he doesn't need to shout it out to the whole world but he won't even accept it himself.
I don't know how to help him with it and because he's almost 19 I have limited control now. It's made my life easier knowing what we're dealing with and I think his life would be easier is he accepted it.
Please help me help him.
I am a clinical psychologist in NYC who now has several (!!) children I see who have RAD. In 20 years of practice, I’d seen only one case. Now, I have at least three children with this. I have no training, per se, in working with this children though I know about setting structure, consistency, etc. I do a lot of work with parents about parenting. I work primarily within the school setting in a charter school whose mission is to educate children on the autism spectrum in a mainstream setting. We use Michelle Garcia Winner’s social thinking program with our ASD kids. I also work with gen ed kids in the school who are at-risk; the school is in the inner city from where the majority of our non-ASD kids live.
It would have been so much easier to mention to my adult son that I think (I know he does, but want to ease into the subject)
he has Asperger's when we were living together two years ago. He has since moved to Tennessee working in his field of interest
which is 3-D printing and software development. I am so happy for him that he has found his way into a job that he truly enjoys
even though he's socially isolated.
He's not diagnosed and does not know he has it. How I know is his classic symptoms being sensory issues (fabric feeling like sandpaper)
communication difficulties, meltdowns and much more. Throughout his childhood I just felt he was a bit different. Nothing major stood out and time
just passes, misdiagnosis of ADHD, low frustration, etc. We've talked about his ADHD numerous times (which I now know he doesn't have).
It's so much easier to communicate with him now that I know he has Asperger's. I keep it ""slow and low"" in talking, with long moments
of silence and then we connect. It's really too bad that Asperger's got a diagnostic code back in the 90's, yet all the so called doctors,
physiologist's, etc, didn't know how to diagnose it. Too bad.
There seems to be no one answer to ""should I tell my adult son he has Asperger's"" from a few specialists I asked. He is typical Asperger,
complicated, highly intelligent (high IQ), anxiety at times, socially isolated, hard to make friends. Not knowing how he will react is the hard part.
How will he be better off knowing he has it? Do I wait to tell him in person, or ease into it with him over Skype? He likes direct, honest, concrete communication.
Why is this so hard for me? Maybe because no one know's if he is going to be better off knowing or not. Do you know if people are better off
knowing? I try to get up the courage to just let him know, then I back down.
I have been searching the web looking for advice and came upon your site. I am trying to read blogs, websites, books, and articles to help guide me. I was so happy when you said that I could ask you a question. My husband and I are struggling with my 27 year old son who lives with us.
Kyle is the youngest of 4 sons. He is a college graduate but never could find the ""right"" job. He has always been quiet and never had a lot of friends. Two years ago, his girlfriend broke up with him. Kyle had an online gambling addiction and was using pot all the time. After the breakup, Kyle was very depressed and started using heroin and finally told my husband he was using. He is now seeing a psychiatrist who has him on suboxone and antidepressants. He is also seeing a psychologist weekly for counseling but it does not seem to be helping.
Last October,, Kyle lost his job, got drunk, and was agitated and came home , fighting with us, damaging our home and being verbally abusive. My other son , age 32, who also lives with us called the police and Kyle got arrested. He is currently in the family court system. He went through an anger management course and now is in substance abuse classes. Kyle continues to verbally abusive to me and blame me for everything. He says he ""hates me ""and calls me terrible names. At times, he pushes my husband and intimidates me. My husband and I are so upset. We just hired an attorney for him because since he has been going to these classes, he is getting more depressed and not getting better. Kyle continues to drink while taking his meds prescribed by the psychiatrist and then he has his ""moods."" My husband and I have met once with the psychiatrist just to give him background information when Kyle started with him.
At this point, we do not know what to do. We never thought at this stage of our life, we would be supporting and spending our retirement money on adult children. I do not know why Kyle hates me, I could not have been a better mom. My husband and I have no life and just do not know what it the right path we should take. Kyle does not want anything to do with us. He spends all his time in his room playing football online.We have tried tough love versus caring and love and understanding. Do you have any advice for me?
This whole ODD and ADHD is killing me as a parent. I work in the field of adult psych and addictions so I am well educated. I have been dealing with my teen being like this for almost 3 years and I totally lost my cool today with my 17-year-old son to the point I told him he is out of the house. He can never simple rules, comes and goes as he pleases sometimes doesn't come home, just recently back in school from several suspension for drug related... I am just so exhausted. He has made me hate life, hate being a parent and sometimes I just feel like not even being here. I bought your program in hopes to it would help, I am at week three and I feel things are getting worse... what am I doing wrong??
My partner hasn't been diagnosed yet but I know he has aspergers ..day to day is a struggle . I feel I'm going crazy with how he makes me feel.Feel let down constantly. He lies alot but I've been told they can't but I know he does.I just feel trapped and unloved.We have a 4yr old daughter together and my main worry with how he is that it will effect our daughter ; (his skills as a parent are so weak.He can't disapline at all.Feel so alone .he hides it well too.I just wondered if things will get worse? He's angry so quick in arguments.Scares me etc.I can't leave as he's the main bread winner and our daughter loves him to bits.Don't know why I'm writing this..Sorry if I'm going on and not making sense :(
I wanted to let you know about a research opportunity for children, teens, and young adults with autism. I am studying the effects of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and psychotherapy on helping people with autism develop subjective awareness of others.
I am writing you to see if this might help someone in your practice, or to see if you might know of someone with autism who may benefit from participating in this study. The requirements of the study will be:
1. A participant should be between 7-21 years of age and have a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder.
2. The participant should enroll in an approved Jiu Jitsu Academy and attend at least two sessions a week for a period of six months.
3. The participant should enroll in social skills groups, provided by my office or be in a steady psychotherapeutic relationship in your office, at least once a week, or minimally two to three times a month.
4. The participant will be given a SRS (Social Responsiveness Scale) test at the beginning of the study, at three months, and again at six months.
If you know of anyone who might benefit from this novel approach to helping to develop social awareness in autism, please do not hesitate to contact me for further information.
I have a 10 year old daughter who has outbursts with prolonged crying almost like tantrums that 2 year olds have when they cannot express themselves.
I had her in therapy from age 6-8 years old for the same thing but I feel that the sessions didn't really help much.
She has severe sensitivities to light, sound, vibration, frequencies which trigger irritability and crying.
We changed her diet and tried getting her involved with activities but she is anti-social and prefers reading than being social. She is terrified of change even in daily routine (even that will trigger prolonged crying).
It frustrates me because I don't know what else to do with her behavior.
I've tried acupuncture (she refused at the first session); she refuses massage too.
She is an honor-roll student at school and has very minimal issues at school but if she has had a bad day it does result in a tantrum or crying and defiance.
How can I get her tested for Asperger's Syndrome?
Last night our 24 year old son with Aspergers told his dad and I that he is pulling out of the 4 college classes that he recetnly enrolled in because he has not been attending class or turning in his assignments. He paid $2800 (his own money) for tuition and I reminded him of this when he told us but it did not seem to bother him.
This is the 3rd time he has started college courses and has not completed them. (He also took some concurrent college classes while he was in high school that he failed). This is a son who basically had a 4.0 grade point average through 10th grade and got a 34 on the ACT the first time he took it.
With the news that he was once again not sticking with college courses I did not sleep well. When I got up this mornning I began looking online for help in how to deal with his situation. I found your ""Launching Adult Children With Aspergers"" and purchased it. Most of what is included are things we have done or did with our son throughout his life. I was hoping for more help so I am emailing you now in hopes of more specific ideas.
We noticed some things with our son, Taylor, as a yound child but as we had not heard of Aspergers at that time we just did what we thought would help him. As a toddler and a child at pre-school he generally went off on his own to play. When I talked to his pre-school teacher about my concerns (that I was worried he would end up a hermit) she said she did not see him being a loner and that he seemed to interact fine with others in many situations. We worked with him on making eye contact when talking with others. We explained different emotions in people's faces and mannerisms to help him know how to interact with others. We discussed the fact that people would say things that did not mean what they souneded like - such as ""I'm so hungry I could eat a horse"". As we did these things he worked hard to better understand communication with others.
During his 4th grade year I had a teacher from the gifted program ask me if I had ever heard of Aspergers. I told her that I had not heard of it. She proceeded to read me some of the charateristics and so many of them described my son. So we had him tested by the school district during the summer between 4th and 5th grade and they did find that he had Aspergers but that he was high functioning. We then set him up with and EIP which stayed with him until his sophomore year. We pulled him from it at that time because we had moved and the new district was requiring him to take one class a day that was a study class. This reduced the number of required classes he could take and he was doing fine with his studies at the time.
It was during the 2nd half of his Junior year that we noticed some of his grades going down. Then during his Senior year is when he started skipping classes and not doing assignments. We had not realized it before then but we soon became aware that he was addicted to gaming. He would go to the library or somewhere else on campus and play games on the computer rather than go to class. It was also at this time that he began lying about his actions (so as not to get in trouble).
Based on his grades and his ACT score he received offers from colleges for full tuition scholarships. He chose the college where he had taken concurrent classes during his high school years. But he proceeded to skip class and not turn in assignments so he lost his scholarship and quit attending college. During this time he was only able to find employment through an employment agency where he was mostly sent to manuel labor type jobs (which is not something he enjoys but he did it anyway). It was during this time that at one place had gone to on numerous occasions he was told if he came late one more time they would tell the emplyment agency they did not want him to come there anymore. (This seemed to make an impression on him because he has continued to be reliable and responsbile at his places of employment).
At 19 1/2 he left to serve a 2 year full-time mission for our church. He completed his mission successfully. (I don't think it was without some struggle, stress and depression, but he was able to pick himself up and move on from those times).
When he came home he started working for the employment agency again but began looking for employment elsewhere. He got a job at a local Chick Fil-A where he has worked for 3 years. He started college again shortly after he came home but as before it was short lived. He did finish out the semester but failed most of the classes due to his skipping class and not turning in assignments. When he skipped class he would usually sleep in his car.
Taylor's life consists of working (where to the best of our knowledge) he does well, he is reliable and his employer likes him. When he comes home from work he either sleeps or plays video games or other games - such as kakuro. He spendes most of his time in the basement where his bedroom is and this is where he games. Taylor owns his own car, bought his own laptop and very rarely spends money. He pays us $200 /month to still live at home, unloads the dishwasher on a regular basis and does the weekly garbage. However, his room is a mess and he only cleans his bathroom when I tell him he needs to clean it.
Taylor used to read quite a bit and loved to learn. It has just been in his adult years that he has not read as much - I think because of his gaming addiction. Taylor goes to church on a regular basis but sleeps through the main meeting. In Sunday class room settings he stays awake - I think because he is able to particpate in discussions.
Taylor has only had 2 real friends since entering Junior High school. And as of now he only keeps in contact with one of them who still lives in Georgia. We have lived in Utah since the summer of 2007 and he has never had a friend to do things with since we have lived here. He has two younger siblings, a brother 22 and a sister 20. They love Taylor and spend time with him when they are home. They are both at college and doing well.
Throughout Taylor's school years he has seen a counsleor on a fairly regular basis. One summer during junior high he attended a weekly class where he interacted with other kids with Aspergers. We did see a lot of change in him from this group. After he returned from his mission he went to see a counselor for a short period - this counselor tried to help him with some social skills. His dad and I went with him the first 3 or 4 times but we found out that after we quit going with him he only went a few more times and then scheduled appointments but did not show a couple of the times. We only found this out when a bill came for a ""no show"" appointment.
I don't know if this is too much information but were are in dire need of help for him. In the information that we purchased from you you mentioned that you do coaching for Aspergers adults. I don't know if you can help us but I thought I would check with you just in case.
Alas I think I have found your information too late to save my marriage but I am hoping to save myself.
I am currently going through a very very painful separation after a 27 year relationship with my husband whom I am convinced has aspergers syndrome. It is a long and painful story and I am desperately trying to process it all alongside dealing with a very conflictual separation. My partner is angry non communicative and totally dismissive of me and our long shared history.
He walked out last year after I discovered he had been visiting massage parlours and developed a relationship with an illegal Chinese escourt whom he subsequently moved in with. He had been seeing this woman behind my back for over 18 months. The pain of all this indescribable and his dismissal of my pain and very existence beyond belief.
Leading up to this I had been battling anxiety and depression which my husband found very hard to cope with.
Over the years of our relationship I knew something was off but I just could not put my finger on it. I often felt a complete lack of validation and empathy. Communication was also difficult as my husband was defensive and unwilling to look at issues in our marriage.
Please Mark could you help me validate some of this pain and try and make dense of 27 years of my life without drowning in fear guilt and despair about my future.
Thank you for listening and your site.
I have had problems with drunkenness, being late for school, not handing in school work, buying pot from a dealer etc. I chose to focus on the drinking and did the grounding then (grounding happened 3 times). I also stopped sleep overs at friends 100%. I have stopped handing out money for no reason or even buying treats like chocolate.
I did lose it one evening (and didn't do the poker face) when I was trying to unplug the internet at midnight on a school night (she’s always late for school so I am trying to get her to sleep at a reasonable hour). I was physically stopped and pushed around so I slapped my daughter (it was not hard). This ended up with her saying she didn’t want to come home (the next day after school). By this stage, I also had enough and didn’t go get her. I thought I am not begging. You will run out of money soon. It was quite a relief to have some peace. Daughter’s Dad was in town (from another country) and called a family meeting with the counsellor. To cut a long story short, daughter and her counsellor put it on the table that daughter wants to go live somewhere else (with her friends family) because of the stress at home with me (we live on our own) (i.e. stricter rules and her bucking up against it).
I didn’t really want this but made a compromise that daughter would go there Tues morning – Friday afternoon as the friend is an A student whereas my daughter is failing. They do the same subjects. I made the decision at the end of the day based on what is good for me – some time away from the daughter. I also thought of your book when the child went to live with the grandparents – daughter will dig her own hole over at the friend’s house. They have a week day no going out policy which made me think it is OK. I went and discussed with them the problems experienced (drinking, pot, late nights, not handing in work)
I am also trying to follow the let go of school thing per your book. I find it really difficult to remain calm when I can see daughter on her phone and watching series (when I have her on the weekends) when I know there are projects due. I hired her a private tutor once a week for help with a subject. The tutor has just fired my daughter for not handing in work and being not committed. It’s not the first time private tutoring has not been appreciated. The school give me a report back on a Friday as to whether everything is handed in. The deal is – if the work is not handed in – no pocket money and no Friday night out). Her school is a ""progressive"" school and there are no repercussions for her being late or not handing in work. I would change schools if I could but there are only 8 months left of school (she turns 18 in August).
We have just completed the first week and beginning week two of your material. We are agreeing with your take and see our son and ourselves in most of what you are saying. Prior to finding your material and starting your program we had been having extreme out of control behaviors and had to call the police because he was breaking things in our house and pushed my husband. This happened three weeks ago. After that incident we took away privileges ie. PS4, phone (which had already been taken for a few days), and friends. So, last week while doing your program he already didn’t have privileges and has continued with poor behavior – name calling, throwing things, slamming doors. We are not sure when to give privileges back. He has been given the privilege of playing with friends on occasion. His 13th birthday is tomorrow. This past weekend, for his birthday my husband and he went boar hunting. Of course we debated about it but decided to go ahead since it was his bday. We are cooking some of the meet on the grill tomorrow night for his bday and inviting a couple of his friends over for a cookout. No more gifts other than cards and balloons. We are wondering if we should go ahead and give him his privileges back and not sure how to do it. Last Friday morning we attempted to talk giving him a date to return privileges and that conversation ended with him getting angry but he gathered from our conversation that he is getting his stuff back on his bday. We are starting week 2 assignments today but not sure how to handle what was already in place. Of course, we aren’t seeing the respect and responsibility we are looking for but realize it has been a long time. We were wanting him to pay for his phone and thought it might be a good time to introduce that idea. Allowing him to earn his phone. We expect that he will be angry with this idea and not sure how to implement.
My son and myself are interested in a inpatient Aspergers program. We line in Calif which is preferable. My son is very high functioning and was diagnosed dry late. He was eight years old. He has never been in or attended a full day of class. Partially due to depression,anxiety, and trouble with his ADHD also his aversion and being bullied and of course his Aspergers. He will not attend his freshmen year due to surgery on both Achilles' tendons from walking on his toes. With physical therapy he should be ready by his sophomore year! We all feel he needs in patient therapy to give him the tools on how to work with his issues in a structured setting and a place that will give him tools for the rest of his life.
In my utter desperation to find a way to get some help for my daughter's increasingly challenging behaviour I trawled the internet to see if I could find some strategies that would provide specific methods on dealing with teenagers with Asperger's syndrome. When I came across your website, I couldn't believe that every statement you made was exactly what I have been going through with my daughter. She has just turned 14 last week, and was diagnosed with Asperger's/ Autism Spectrum Disorder 15 months ago. I have already been seeing a child psychologist for the past five months, however the methods she has been advising have not been very effective.
Our main difficulty with our daughter is her overwhelming obsession to use her cell phone (and to a lesser extent her laptop) constantly. Without any restriction, she will be on it every minute of the day, and will be awake until the early hours every day. We have tried to incorporate her input around rules as to when she has to give in her phone, but she is unwilling to compromise on a time that she should give it to us, believing that she should have unlimited use. I believe she is unable to do any adequate study or homework, as she is constantly having to look at the phone. We have tried to put rules in place that she has to give in her phone and laptop on school nights at 22:15. If she is able to do this then she is given rewards, and if she doesn't then she knows that there will be consequences. The consequence has been restricted use the following day. However, this is usually where we fail, because taking her phone away from her results in tantrums, screaming, and even threatening to harm herself. This behaviour is relentless to the point where the whole family becomes deeply distressed, and inevitably results in her getting the phone back.
This obsession is affecting her schoolwork, and more severely her eyesight. She has become very shortsighted, and her eyesight continues to deteriorate as a result of holding the phone or laptop very close, and mostly in the dark without any lights on. My husband and I have a constant battle on our hands daily, in all areas of discipline with our daughter, but our main concern is that we have been unable to find a way to minimise this obsessive behaviour centred around her phone and laptop. Please can you provide some strategies that can help us specifically with this problem.
First of all, I thank you for developing this program and I am only at the first stage of assignment 1. I have loads of books I have bought, attended psychiatrists for my son and myself, family therapy, occupational therapy, begged and prayed for change but have been dealing with behavioural issues for so long I am definitely exhausted and resentful.
I am a mum to a 15 yr old boy with ASD, dyslexia, OCD and ODD. Sorry to focus on the labels but just to give you an idea of what I am dealing with. I also have a 13 yr old son whom finds his brother’s behaviours difficult, embarassing and challenging. My husband whom is not in great health ( he had a cerebral aneurysm clamped two years ago and has two further aneurysms that are inoperable so endures fatigue, headaches and stress). We have however a pet cat that is very social and a calming influence in the home! I was fortunate enough to have loving parents but I lost both my mum and dad in 2008 and 2015. My inlaws are elderly and quite directly say they are too old to help us so it feels we are alone in dealing with the issues we have.
I am desperate for change as the household is one of stress and anger and I feel all the control lies in my son Patrick’s hands. I am hopeful your programme can make life better for all of us but I wonder if it is too early to ask you two questions?
The first lies with what to do when Patrick goes into my other son Brendan’s room and will either turn on a light when he is sleeping, yell when he is on his phone or create some disturbance. He will not leave the room when asked to do so and the situation always escalates into yelling and Brendan attempting to physically remove him. This happens regularly and always ends badly with doors slamming, my husband being woken and myself in tears feeling the lack of control and also I admit I seem to think “Why me?” which rationally I know is of no help.
The second problem is leaving the house for school. Patrick refuses personal hygiene (either morning or night) and any request to even brush his teeth is fraught with swearing and abuse. If I can get him to shower, he will watch the water roll down the drain and turn up the water really high temp (mu husband has had to turn down the thermostat on the hot water service) without so much as getting wet. My husband leaves for work at 6am but I leave at 745 to work as a nurse in a busy outpatients department in the Alfred Hospital (Melbourne). My work is my sanity as it is a paid break from home but most days I am late which is causing considerable stress and anxiety not to mention my responsibility to do my job. Patrick simply refuses to leave the house and as much as I am tempted to just walk out and leave I know the house would be left unlocked and wonder if Patrick would even attend school. The time I need to leave is not negotiable but Patrick uses this to his advantage and seems to delight in stressing me out and subsequently speeding to work in a frazzled mess.
The interesting and frustrating element in all of this is that although he is socially isolated at school (he has no friends) and academically challenged his behaviour at school is not a problem. He is quiet and his teachers report he does his best and is compliant and well mannered. It is like a Jekyll and Hyde situation where another side of him at home is so angry and abusive yet at school this behaviour does not happen.
I’m Jackie, I now work primarily as a freelance tech writer, after starting my career in software development and moving on to teach IT to young adults at a variety of colleges and schools.
My freelance work is pretty varied and looks at many aspects of the computer industry as a whole, and I’ve just recently completed a piece which gives help and advice to anyone wanting to become a game designer, which you can read here: http://www.gamedesigning.org/become-a-game-designer/. It highlights the hard work and effort it takes to get into such a role, and also how you can further your career and continue to learn and improve as you go. I hope you’ll agree it shows that starting work in the industry takes dedication and skill and that becoming a game designer isn’t just a fly-by-night job!
If you’d be interested in sharing a quick mention of my work on your blog that would be really wonderful and I’d appreciate the chance to get my work out there to a wider audience. Alternatively, I’d be happy to write a short blurb or paragraph or two (or a longer piece - just let me know) highlighting the key points because I think some of your readers might get a lot of value from it.
My son just turned 15 and is a freshman in high school. Although this is his first year in a general ed environment, he is struggling with behaviors in school. He has meltdowns and does not express why he would have them until much later. Once we all know what caused it, the school will accommodate him and try to ""change up"" things so as not to cause his meltdown. Once that is resolved, another issue comes up and causes him to melt down. He is a high functioning and academically does well, when he wants to do the work. We battle at home over homework. He does not care how it is done, as long as he hands it in. He thinks failing a test is ok, at least he took the test. Homework is never on his mind when he gets home from school. If I never prompt him, he would never open is backpack. He can be aggressive but is never intentionally trying to hurt anyone. He may push over a chair in school, but it is not directed at anyone. We know how that in itself could hurt someone who gets hit by it though. He is defiant in that he only wants to do what interests him. He does not go out by himself (still immature), or abuse alcohol or drugs and never curses. He is a very funny kid and very talented. His main problems are task avoidance and seeking attention. He can be disrespectful to adults in that he is ""cheeky"" with them, trying to be funny or cute. And he has no ""filters"".
I’ve just finished reading your Living with an Aspergers Partner ebook. I found it so informative, thank you.
You offered some personal advise, and i wanted to run a situation past you and seek your input as to a strategy for what to do next.
I’ve been seeing a guy for about 7 months now who I believe has Aspergers. I came to this conclusion months ago and I don’t think he realizes, (or acknowledges) although he is aware he has some traits.
He’s highly intelligent and successful, a pattern seeker, has a tendency to focus on the project to hand to the total exclusion of all else for as long sit takes (work or home) socially awkward (has learned coping strategies), sensitive to loud noise, high anxiety with control strategies, black and white thinking etc. He’s currently not working and I’ve seen a slow withdrawal over the last 6 weeks, including the need to ‘escape’ and leave a situation at least once.
He also has a bipolar ex overseas who has primary custody one daughter where there has been ongoing patterns of drama which has recently increased.
Over the past couple of months (since stopping work and drama increase) I’ve gone from being ‘wonderful’ in his eyes to him now being sorry and not having the ‘urge’ to spend close/intimate time with me and offering friendship. Since he shared that with me in a message he’s stonewalled and has retreated to the safety of minimal messages and talks about not knowing what best to say and not being able to find the right words somehow.
He’s a good kind man who I feel is struggling. I’m concerned about his anxiety and possibly the risk of depression. I’m fairly resilient and whilst i’m disappointed he doesn’t want to pursue a relationship with me, i’m concerned for him and his well being. One of his very few close friends is also just leaving the country to live overseas.
The strategy I’ve used so far is simply to back off and give him space. I’ve asked to take him up on an original offer he made to talk but haven’t pushed it. I also haven’t been aggressive or accusatory in the few messages i’ve sent.
Any advise you could give would be greatly appreciated,
Carli who is 10 years old and has had behavioral issues her whole life. The other night she came home very upset after having a conflict with a friend. She was at her friend's house and her and her friend wanted to get on the computer and the older sister was using it. Carli made up a story that someone was at the door to get the older sister off the computer. Her friend didn't understand that she was making up a story to get the sister off the computer. She got excited that someone was at the door and ran downstairs to answer the door. In the process of getting the door, she fell and yelled at Carli. Carli became extremely upset. She was able to control her feelings at her friend's house, but when she came home, she proceeded to cry extremely loudly for over an hour. Her dad spent most of that time with her, talking to her and trying to calm her down. After an hour, I asked him if he could please tell her to be more quiet because the other members of the household were trying to go to sleep.
My question is....how do I as the girlfriend, handle this? He did not like that I asked her to be quiet. We have a rule that if she is having bad behavior, and can't calm down in 5 minutes, he takes her out of the house because her yelling doesn't stop for a long time and is very upsetting to everyone in the household. I would like to ask him to do this with this kind of situation as well. Is this a reasonable request? His thought was that she shouldn't be made to calm down, because everyone handles being upset in a different way. But, she was literally sobbing and wailing very loudly.
My other question is should she have been told that if she wouldn't have lied, this wouldn't have happened? She has a history of lying and of not accepting responsibility for her actions. My boyfriend became very upset with me when I brought this up. He was being very sympathetic and understanding to her. I feel like he was giving her negative attention, and being an over indulgent parent by not putting his foot gown and saying, ""you can't carry on like this, even though you are upset"". Please let me know how we can handle these situations better.
I am contacting you for help with adult AS. I am taking initiative to pre screen potential therapists to help my current boyfriend get therapy and help with Adult AS.
He has seen many therapists, but it seems like they aren’t really helping him with his problems. They don’t seem to understand how his (undiagnosed) AS would affect therapy approaches. For example, he may not share enough in therapy session and I’m assuming an AS therapist would recognize that is part of the AS and employ strategies to get information from him that helps with treatment. Sometime he tunes out when he is processing something heavy or that he doesn’t want to hear necessarily, or he gets distracted and I’m hoping an As therapist would recognize that and get that he may need repeated something for example, if this is happening.
He is currently suffering from depression that appears clinical in nature as well as reoccurring negative thoughts about something specific that has been worrying him about our relationship. Today he told me these reoccurring thoughts happen during all waking hours unless he watches TV, he never gets a break from them and they make him feel like he is going crazy. As his girlfriend, I am extremely concerned that he cannot get relief from these thoughts and that the therapists he is seeing are unable to help him with his problems. Therefore, I am taking initiative to try and help him find better therapy options, because I want to see him someone who can better help him get to the bottom of things and help him with the challenges he is facing. He really needs an advocate that will help him go deep to figure things out and not just assume therapies are working well, without seeing changes or getting supporting feedback from him in that regard.
Here are some questions I am trying to ask in advance to find the right people to help us with this. As you may know, insurance for these therapies are not often available. We don’t have a lot of money to go from therapist to therapist to find the right person and are hoping prescreening will help.
I recently downloaded your e-book and listened to your talks and your information is by far the most helpful I have been able to find to date. It's very accurately describes my situation as an NT wife married to a very probable AS husband. I think you for taking the time to write this and sharing your insights as well as the experiences of many of your clients. It has really helped me understand the last 32 years of our marriage and get a grasp on how to move forward.
One area that is of primary concern to me, that I did not see addressed, is stimming. I believe that is the behavior my husband is showing through constant vocal singing, repetition of words, shouting out, as well as slapping himself in the chest and general nervous activity. It is very loud and disruptive to our household and it is often a relief when he is not at home. I think there may be a level of Tourette's syndrome as well.
I did some searches on the Internet and could not find anything that really describes his behavior. Most of what I found was flapping or children's behavior. I understand that it is a release of nervous tension but I am really trying to find some strategies to help him stop this behavior as it is extremely frustrating and builds my resentment in dealing with it daily. A lot of it is embarrassing as well and sounds childish to me.
He usually does this when close family members are around and will reign himself in if he is around other people besides us. When we are home it is constant. He also has a lot of anger, mostly at himself, and blows up at unimportant things, it is as if he has a ton of negative energy inside him that need to get out and stimming is one outlet.
I will try to build my acceptance of it, but I also would just like him to stop especially the loudest and most annoying portions. Would you have any resources you could point me to?",['3-D printing and software development.'],8501,multifieldqa_en,en,,0f101ee4ea9d1d88998598e0405367ad95912c92a7d7a31d," My Aspergers Child: COMMENTS & QUESTIONS [for Feb., 2017]                 ""I emailed you a while back and you mentioned that I could email when I needed to.

I am fighting much guilt still but I have a lot of peace now"" My daughter is smoking pot almost every day at school. She is now saying she's suicidal because she feels so isolated, yet she continues to smoke weed. She tried to sneak out last night but was foiled by our alarm system. For the particular drug test we have, I read it takes about 10 days of not smoking to pass the test. What would you do? Please advise. I am having a problem with my 18 year old son, Danny, with high functioning autism. It's been 2 years now and he will not accept his diagnosis. He won't talk about it and when I try to bring it up he gets very angry. I told him that he doesn't need to shout it out to the whole world but he won't even accept it himself. I don't know how to help him with it and because he's almost 19 I have limited control now. I think his life would be easier is he accepted it.Please help me help him. I have no training, per se, in working with this children though I know about setting structure, consistency, etc. I work primarily within the school setting in a charter school whose mission is to educate children on the autism spectrum. Asperger's got a diagnostic code back in the 90's, yet all the so called doctors,physiologist's, etc, didn't know how to diagnose it. Do you know if people are better off knowing they have it? Do I wait to tell him in person, or ease into it with him over Skype? He likes direct, honest, concrete communication with his parents. I have been dealing with my teen being like this for almost 3 years. I totally lost my cool today with my 17-year-old son to the point I told him he is out of the house. He can never simple rules, comes and goes as he pleases. He has made me feel exhausted, and sometimes I just like not even being here. I bought your program at three and a half dollars a week in hopes to help, I am so happy to have you as a friend. You can contact me at: jennifer.glanfield@mailonline.co.uk or on Twitter @jenniferGLanfield. I would also like to hear from you if you have any questions or concerns about this story. I am studying the effects of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and psychotherapy on helping people with autism develop subjective awareness of others. I wanted to let you know about a research opportunity for children, teens, and young adults with autism. I have a 10 year old daughter who has outbursts with prolonged crying almost like tantrums that 2 year olds have when they cannot express themselves. I had her in therapy from age 6-8 years old for the same thing but I feel that the sessions didn't really help much. How can I get her tested for Asperger's Syndrome? Last night our 24 year old son with Aspergers told his dad and I that he is pulling out of the 4 college classes that he recetnly enrolled in because he has not been attending class or turning in his assignments. He paid $2800 (his own money) for tuition and I reminded him of this when he told us but it did not seem to bother him. This is a son who basically had a 4.0 grade point average through 10th grade and got a 34 on the ACT the first time he took it. He also took some concurrent college classes while he was in high school that he failed. We noticed some things with our son, Taylor, as a yound child but as we had not heard of Aspergers at that time we just did what we thought would help him. We then set him up with and EIP which stayed with him until his sophomore year. Then during his Senior year is when he started skipping classes and not doing assignments. At 19 1/2 he left to serve a 2 year full-time mission for our church. He completed his mission successfully. When he comes home from work he either sleeps or plays video games or other games - such as kakuro. He spendes most of his time in the basement where his bedroom is and this is where he games. Taylor owns his own car, bought his own laptop and very rarely spends his own money. He pays uceific ideas.ecific ideas to help you understand your son's condition. The Asperger's Foundation is a non-profit organization that provides support and resources to families of children with autism. For more information on the Asperberger's Foundation, visit www.aspergers.org. Taylor has only had 2 real friends since entering Junior High school. He has never had a friend to do things with since we have lived in Utah. Taylor goes to church on a regular basis but sleeps through the main meeting. He only cleans his bathroom when I tell him he needs to clean it. His room is a mess and he only keeps in contact with one of them who still lives in Georgia. He spends $200 /month to still live at home, unloads the dishwasher on a regularly basis and does the weekly garbage. The pain of all this is indescribable and his dismissal of my pain and very existence beyond belief. I am desperately trying to process it all alongside dealing with a very conflictual separation. My partner is angry non communicative and totally dismissive of me and our long shared history. He walked out last year after I discovered he had been visiting massage parlours and developed a relationship with an illegal Chinese escourt. He had been seeing this woman behind my back for over 18 months. I don't know if this is too much information but were in dire need of help for him. Daughter's Dad was in town (from another country) and called a family meeting with the counsellor. Daughter wants to go live somewhere else (with her friends family) because of the stress at home with me. I made the decision at the end of the day based on what is good for me – some time away from the daughter. Her school is a ""progressive"" school and there are no repercussions for her being late or not handing in work.

What is the recommended daily intake of vitamin K for adult women and men?,"Vitamin K - Wikipedia

Vitamin K structures. MK-4 and MK-7 are both subtypes of K2.
Vitamin K deficiency, Warfarin overdose
Vitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins the human body requires for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are prerequisites for blood coagulation and which the body also needs for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues. The vitamin K-related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Low levels of vitamin K also weaken bones and promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues[citation needed].
Chemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 and vitamin K2.[1] Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms.
Vitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It may be thought of as the plant form of vitamin K. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2.
Bacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into vitamin K2. In addition, bacteria typically lengthen the isoprenoid side chain of vitamin K2 to produce a range of vitamin K2 forms, most notably the MK-7 to MK-11 homologues of vitamin K2. All forms of K2 other than MK-4 can only be produced by bacteria, which use these forms in anaerobic respiration. The MK-7 and other bacterially derived forms of vitamin K2 exhibit vitamin K activity in animals, but MK-7's extra utility over MK-4, if any, is unclear and is a matter of investigation.
Three synthetic types of vitamin K are known: vitamins K3, K4, and K5. Although the natural K1 and all K2 homologues and synthetic K4 and K5 have proven nontoxic, the synthetic form K3 (menadione) has shown toxicity.[2]

11.3 Controversy
A review of 2014 concluded that there is positive evidence that monotherapy using MK-4, one of the forms of Vitamin K2, reduces fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, and suggested further research on the combined use of MK-4 with bisphosphonates. In contrast, an earlier review article of 2013 concluded that there is no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation helps prevent osteoporosis or fractures in postmenopausal women.[3]
A Cochrane systematic review of 2006 suggested that supplementation with Vitamin K1 and with MK4 reduces bone loss; in particular, a strong effect of MK-4 on incident fractures among Japanese patients was emphasized.[4]
A review article of 2016 suggested to consider, as one of several measures for bone health, increasing the intake of foods rich in vitamins K1 and K2.[5]
Cardiovascular health[edit]
Adequate intake of vitamin K is associated with the inhibition of arterial calcification and stiffening,[6] but there have been few interventional studies and no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation is of any benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.[7]
One 10-year population study, the Rotterdam Study, did show a clear and significant inverse relationship between the highest intake levels of menaquinone (mainly MK-4 from eggs and meat, and MK-8 and MK-9 from cheese) and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in older men and women.[8]
Vitamin K has been promoted in supplement form with claims it can slow tumor growth; there is however no good medical evidence that supports such claims.[9]
Coumarin poisoning[edit]
Vitamin K is part of the suggested treatment regime for poisoning by rodenticide (coumarin poisoning).[10]
Although allergic reaction from supplementation is possible, no known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K, so no tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set.[11]
Blood clotting (coagulation) studies in humans using 45 mg per day of vitamin K2 (as MK-4)[12] and even up to 135 mg per day (45 mg three times daily) of K2 (as MK-4),[13] showed no increase in blood clot risk. Even doses in rats as high as 250 mg/kg, body weight did not alter the tendency for blood-clot formation to occur.[14]
Unlike the safe natural forms of vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 and their various isomers, a synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), is demonstrably toxic at high levels. The U.S. FDA has banned this form from over-the-counter sale in the United States because large doses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells.[2]
Phylloquinone (K1)[15][16] or menaquinone (K2) are capable of reversing the anticoagulant activity of the anticoagulant warfarin (tradename Coumadin). Warfarin works by blocking recycling of vitamin K, so that the body and tissues have lower levels of active vitamin K, and thus a deficiency of vitamin K.
Supplemental vitamin K (for which oral dosing is often more active than injectable dosing in human adults) reverses the vitamin K deficiency caused by warfarin, and therefore reduces the intended anticoagulant action of warfarin and related drugs.[17] Sometimes small amounts of vitamin K are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable.[17] The proper anticoagulant action of the drug is a function of vitamin K intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient.[citation needed] The action of warfarin and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect, and neither warfarin or vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given.[18]
The newer anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have different mechanisms of action that do not interact with vitamin K, and may be taken with supplemental vitamin K.[19][20]
Vitamin K2 (menaquinone). In menaquinone, the side chain is composed of a varying number of isoprenoid residues. The most common number of these residues is four, since animal enzymes normally produce menaquinone-4 from plant phylloquinone.
A sample of phytomenadione for injection, also called phylloquinone
The three synthetic forms of vitamin K are vitamins K3 (menadione), K4, and K5, which are used in many areas, including the pet food industry (vitamin K3) and to inhibit fungal growth (vitamin K5).[21]
Conversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2[edit]
Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) – both forms of the vitamin contain a functional naphthoquinone ring and an aliphatic side chain. Phylloquinone has a phytyl side chain.
The MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls.[22] While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in germ-free rats[23][24] and in parenterally-administered K1 in rats.[25][26] In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4.[27][28] There is evidence that the conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also prenylation) to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrione) form.[29]
Vitamin K2[edit]
Main article: Vitamin K2
Vitamin K2 (menaquinone) includes several subtypes. The two subtypes most studied are menaquinone-4 (menatetrenone, MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7).
Vitamin K1, the precursor of most vitamin K in nature, is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants, where it functions as an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis. For this reason, vitamin K1 is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.). Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. The function of phylloquinone in plants appears to have no resemblance to its later metabolic and biochemical function (as ""vitamin K"") in animals, where it performs a completely different biochemical reaction.
Vitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are often (but not always) situated within specific protein domains called Gla domains. Gla residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins.[30]
At this time[update], 17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered, and they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes:
Blood coagulation: prothrombin (factor II), factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C, S, and Z[31]
Bone metabolism: osteocalcin, also called bone Gla protein (BGP), matrix Gla protein (MGP),[32] periostin,[33] and the recently discovered Gla-rich protein (GRP).[34][35]
Vascular biology: growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6)[36]
Unknown function: proline-rich γ-carboxyglutamyl proteins (PRGPs) 1 and 2, and transmembrane γ-carboxy glutamyl proteins (TMGs) 3 and 4.[37]
Like other lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D and E), vitamin K is stored in the fatty tissue of the human body.
Absorption and dietary need[edit]
Previous theory held that dietary deficiency is extremely rare unless the small intestine was heavily damaged, resulting in malabsorption of the molecule. Another at-risk group for deficiency were those subject to decreased production of K2 by normal intestinal microbiota, as seen in broad spectrum antibiotic use.[38] Taking broad-spectrum antibiotics can reduce vitamin K production in the gut by nearly 74% in people compared with those not taking these antibiotics.[39] Diets low in vitamin K also decrease the body's vitamin K concentration.[40] Those with chronic kidney disease are at risk for vitamin K deficiency, as well as vitamin D deficiency, and particularly those with the apoE4 genotype.[41] Additionally, in the elderly there is a reduction in vitamin K2 production.[42]
The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) updated an estimate of what constitutes an adequate intake (AI) for vitamin K in 2001. The NAM does not distinguish between K1 and K2 – both are counted as vitamin K. At that time there was not sufficient evidence to set the more rigorous estimated average requirement (EAR) or recommended dietary allowance (RDA) given for most of the essential vitamins and minerals. The current daily AIs for vitamin K for adult women and men are 90 μg and 120 μg respectively. The AI for pregnancy and lactation is 90 μg. For infants up to 12 months the AI is 2–2.5 μg, and for children aged 1 to 18 years the AI increases with age from 30 to 75 μg. As for safety, the FNB also sets tolerable upper intake levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of vitamin K no UL is set, as evidence for adverse effects is not sufficient. Collectively EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as dietary reference intakes.[43] The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and did not set an UL.[44]
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percentage of daily value (%DV). For vitamin K labeling purposes the daily value was 80 μg, but as of May 2016 it has been revised upwards to 120 μg. A table of the pre-change adult daily values is provided at reference daily intake. Food and supplement companies have until 28 July 2018 to comply with the change.

Vitamin K1 is found chiefly in leafy green vegetables such as dandelion greens (which contain 778.4 μg per 100 g, or 741% of the recommended daily amount), spinach, swiss chard, lettuce and Brassica vegetables (such as cabbage, kale, cauliflower, broccoli, and brussels sprouts) and often the absorption is greater when accompanied by fats such as butter or oils; some fruits, such as avocados, kiwifruit and grapes, are also high in vitamin K. By way of reference, two tablespoons of parsley contains 153% of the recommended daily amount of vitamin K.[47] Some vegetable oils, notably soybean oil, contain vitamin K, but at levels that would require relatively large calorie consumption to meet the USDA-recommended levels.[48] colonic bacteria synthesize a significant portion of humans' vitamin K needs; newborns often receive a vitamin K shot at birth to tide them over until their colons become colonized at five to seven days of age from the consumption of breast milk.
The tight binding of vitamin K1 to thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts makes it less bioavailable. For example, cooked spinach has a 5% bioavailability of phylloquinone, however, fat added to it increases bioavailability to 13% due to the increased solubility of vitamin K in fat.[49]
Main article: Vitamin K deficiency
Average diets are usually not lacking in vitamin K, and primary deficiency is rare in healthy adults. Newborn infants are at an increased risk of deficiency. Other populations with an increased prevalence of vitamin K deficiency include those who suffer from liver damage or disease (e.g. alcoholics), cystic fibrosis, or inflammatory bowel diseases, or have recently had abdominal surgeries. Secondary vitamin K deficiency can occur in people with bulimia, those on stringent diets, and those taking anticoagulants. Other drugs associated with vitamin K deficiency include salicylates, barbiturates, and cefamandole, although the mechanisms are still unknown. Vitamin K1 deficiency can result in coagulopathy, a bleeding disorder.[50]Symptoms of K1 deficiency include anemia, bruising, nosebleeds and bleeding of the gums in both sexes, and heavy menstrual bleeding in women.
Osteoporosis[51][52] and coronary heart disease[53][54] are strongly associated with lower levels of K2 (menaquinone). Vitamin K2 (as menaquinones MK-4 through MK-10) intake level is inversely related to severe aortic calcification and all-cause mortality.[8]
Function in animals[edit]
Mechanism of action of vitamin K1.
The function of vitamin K2 in the animal cell is to add a carboxylic acid functional group to a glutamate (Glu) amino acid residue in a protein, to form a gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residue. This is a somewhat uncommon posttranslational modification of the protein, which is then known as a ""Gla protein"". The presence of two −COOH (carboxylic acid) groups on the same carbon in the gamma-carboxyglutamate residue allows it to chelate calcium ions. The binding of calcium ions in this way very often triggers the function or binding of Gla-protein enzymes, such as the so-called vitamin K-dependent clotting factors discussed below.
Within the cell, vitamin K undergoes electron reduction to a reduced form called vitamin K hydroquinone, catalyzed by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR).[55] Another enzyme then oxidizes vitamin K hydroquinone to allow carboxylation of Glu to Gla; this enzyme is called gamma-glutamyl carboxylase[56][57] or the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. The carboxylation reaction only proceeds if the carboxylase enzyme is able to oxidize vitamin K hydroquinone to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The carboxylation and epoxidation reactions are said to be coupled. Vitamin K epoxide is then reconverted to vitamin K by VKOR. The reduction and subsequent reoxidation of vitamin K coupled with carboxylation of Glu is called the vitamin K cycle.[58] Humans are rarely deficient in vitamin K1 because, in part, vitamin K1 is continuously recycled in cells.[59]
Warfarin and other 4-hydroxycoumarins block the action of VKOR.[60] This results in decreased concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in tissues, such that the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by the glutamyl carboxylase is inefficient. This results in the production of clotting factors with inadequate Gla. Without Gla on the amino termini of these factors, they no longer bind stably to the blood vessel endothelium and cannot activate clotting to allow formation of a clot during tissue injury. As it is impossible to predict what dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, warfarin treatment must be carefully monitored to avoid overdose.
Gamma-carboxyglutamate proteins[edit]
Main article: Gla domain
The following human Gla-containing proteins (""Gla proteins"") have been characterized to the level of primary structure: blood coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, anticoagulant proteins C and S, and the factor X-targeting protein Z. The bone Gla protein osteocalcin, the calcification-inhibiting matrix Gla protein (MGP), the cell growth regulating growth arrest specific gene 6 protein (Gas6), and the four transmembrane Gla proteins (TMGPs), the function of which is at present unknown. Gas6 can function as a growth factor to activate the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase and stimulate cell proliferation or prevent apoptosis in some cells. In all cases in which their function was known, the presence of the Gla residues in these proteins turned out to be essential for functional activity.
Gla proteins are known to occur in a wide variety of vertebrates: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The venom of a number of Australian snakes acts by activating the human blood-clotting system. In some cases, activation is accomplished by snake Gla-containing enzymes that bind to the endothelium of human blood vessels and catalyze the conversion of procoagulant clotting factors into activated ones, leading to unwanted and potentially deadly clotting.
Another interesting class of invertebrate Gla-containing proteins is synthesized by the fish-hunting snail Conus geographus.[61] These snails produce a venom containing hundreds of neuroactive peptides, or conotoxins, which is sufficiently toxic to kill an adult human. Several of the conotoxins contain two to five Gla residues.[62]
Methods of assessment[edit]
Vitamin K status can be assessed by:
The prothrombin time (PT) test measures the time required for blood to clot. A blood sample is mixed with citric acid and put in a fibrometer; delayed clot formation indicates a deficiency. This test is insensitive to mild deficiency, as the values do not change until the concentration of prothrombin in the blood has declined by at least 50%.[63]
Undercarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II); in a study of 53 newborns, found ""PT (prothrombin time) is a less sensitive marker than PIVKA II"",[64] and as indicated above, PT is unable to detect subclinical deficiencies that can be detected with PIVKA-II testing.
Plasma phylloquinone was found to be positively correlated with phylloquinone intake in elderly British women, but not men,[65] but an article by Schurgers et al. reported no correlation between FFQ[further explanation needed] and plasma phylloquinone.[66]
Urinary γ-carboxyglutamic acid responds to changes in dietary vitamin K intake. Several days are required before any change can be observed. In a study by Booth et al., increases of phylloquinone intakes from 100 μg to between 377 and 417 μg for five days did not induce a significant change. Response may be age-specific.[67]
Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (UcOc) levels have been inversely correlated with stores of vitamin K[68] and bone strength in developing rat tibiae. Another study following 78 post-menopausal Korean women found a supplement regimen of vitamins K and D, and calcium, but not a regimen of vitamin D and calcium, was inversely correlated with reduced UcOc levels.[69]
Function in bacteria[edit]
Many bacteria, such as Escherichia coli found in the large intestine, can synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7 or MK-7, up to MK-11),[70] but not vitamin K1 (phylloquinone). In these bacteria, menaquinone transfers two electrons between two different small molecules, during oxygen-independent metabolic energy production processes (anaerobic respiration).[71] For example, a small molecule with an excess of electrons (also called an electron donor) such as lactate, formate, or NADH, with the help of an enzyme, passes two electrons to menaquinone. The menaquinone, with the help of another enzyme, then transfers these two electrons to a suitable oxidant, such fumarate or nitrate (also called an electron acceptor). Adding two electrons to fumarate or nitrate converts the molecule to succinate or nitrite plus water, respectively.
Some of these reactions generate a cellular energy source, ATP, in a manner similar to eukaryotic cell aerobic respiration, except the final electron acceptor is not molecular oxygen, but fumarate or nitrate. In aerobic respiration, the final oxidant is molecular oxygen (O2), which accepts four electrons from an electron donor such as NADH to be converted to water. E. coli, as facultative anaerobes, can carry out both aerobic respiration and menaquinone-mediated anaerobic respiration.
Injection in newborns[edit]
The blood clotting factors of newborn babies are roughly 30–60% that of adult values; this may be due to the reduced synthesis of precursor proteins and the sterility of their guts. Human milk contains 1–4 μg/L of vitamin K1, while formula-derived milk can contain up to 100 μg/L in supplemented formulas. Vitamin K2 concentrations in human milk appear to be much lower than those of vitamin K1. Occurrence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25–1.7%, with a prevalence of 2–10 cases per 100,000 births.[72] Premature babies have even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency.
Bleeding in infants due to vitamin K deficiency can be severe, leading to hospitalization, blood transfusions, brain damage, and death. Supplementation can prevent most cases of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the newborn. Intramuscular administration is more effective in preventing late vitamin K deficiency bleeding than oral administration.[73][74]
As a result of the occurrences of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended 0.5–1 mg of vitamin K1 be administered to all newborns shortly after birth.[74]
In the UK vitamin K supplementation is recommended for all newborns within the first 24 hours.[75] This is usually given as a single intramuscular injection of 1 mg shortly after birth but as a second-line option can be given by three oral doses over the first month.[76]
Controversy arose in the early 1990s regarding this practice, when two studies suggested a relationship between parenteral administration of vitamin K and childhood cancer,[77] however, poor methods and small sample sizes led to the discrediting of these studies, and a review of the evidence published in 2000 by Ross and Davies found no link between the two.[78] Doctors reported emerging concerns in 2013,[79] after treating children for serious bleeding problems. They cited lack-of newborn vitamin K administration, as the reason that the problems occurred, and recommended that breastfed babies could have an increased risk unless they receive a preventative dose.
In the early 1930s, Danish scientist Henrik Dam investigated the role of cholesterol by feeding chickens a cholesterol-depleted diet.[80] He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC).[81] McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, had used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow. They noticed that chicks fed only fat-depleted chow developed hemorrhages and started bleeding from tag sites.[82] Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that – together with the cholesterol – a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as Koagulationsvitamin. Edward Adelbert Doisy of Saint Louis University did much of the research that led to the discovery of the structure and chemical nature of vitamin K.[83] Dam and Doisy shared the 1943 Nobel Prize for medicine for their work on vitamin K (K1 and K2) published in 1939. Several laboratories synthesized the compound(s) in 1939.[84]
For several decades, the vitamin K-deficient chick model was the only method of quantifying vitamin K in various foods: the chicks were made vitamin K-deficient and subsequently fed with known amounts of vitamin K-containing food. The extent to which blood coagulation was restored by the diet was taken as a measure for its vitamin K content. Three groups of physicians independently found this: Biochemical Institute, University of Copenhagen (Dam and Johannes Glavind), University of Iowa Department of Pathology (Emory Warner, Kenneth Brinkhous, and Harry Pratt Smith), and the Mayo Clinic (Hugh Butt, Albert Snell, and Arnold Osterberg).[85]
The first published report of successful treatment with vitamin K of life-threatening hemorrhage in a jaundiced patient with prothrombin deficiency was made in 1938 by Smith, Warner, and Brinkhous.[86]
The precise function of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when three laboratories (Stenflo et al.,[87] Nelsestuen et al.,[88] and Magnusson et al.[89]) isolated the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor prothrombin (factor II) from cows that received a high dose of a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. It was shown that, while warfarin-treated cows had a form of prothrombin that contained 10 glutamate (Glu) amino acid residues near the amino terminus of this protein, the normal (untreated) cows contained 10 unusual residues that were chemically identified as γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla). The extra carboxyl group in Gla made clear that vitamin K plays a role in a carboxylation reaction during which Glu is converted into Gla.
The biochemistry of how vitamin K is used to convert Glu to Gla has been elucidated over the past thirty years in academic laboratories throughout the world.

Unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed. For vitamin K1 the form usually used as a supplement, see Phytomenadione. MK-4 and MK-7 are both subtypes of K2. Vitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2, which can only be produced by bacteria. The natural K1 and all K2 homologues and synthetic K4 and K5 have proven nontoxic, but the synthetic form K3 (menadione) has shown toxicity. A review of 2014 concluded that there is positive evidence that monotherapy using one of the forms of Vitamin K2 reduces fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis. In contrast, an earlier review article of 2013 concluded there is no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation helps prevent fractures in post menopausal women. No good evidence that vitamin K supplementation is of any benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), is demonstrably toxic at high levels. Vitamin K is part of the suggested treatment regime for poisoning by rodenticide (coumarin poisoning).[10] No known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (Vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of Vitamin K. The U.S. FDA has banned this form from over-the-counter sale in the United States because large doses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells. Sometimes small amounts of vitaminK are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable. The proper anticoagulant action is a function of vitamink intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient. The action of warfar in and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect. Neither warfarins or vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given. Vitamin K1 is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants. It is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach) It occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.) Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. Vitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins. 17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered, and they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes: blood coagulation, bone metabolism and vascular biology. Diets low in vitamin K also decrease the body's vitamin K concentration. Those with chronic kidney disease are at risk for vitamin K deficiency, as well as vitamin D deficiency, and particularly those with the apoE4 genotype. The National Academy of Medicine updated an estimate of what constitutes an adequate intake of vitamin K in 2001. Vitamin K1 is found chiefly in leafy green vegetables such as dandelion greens, spinach, swiss chard, lettuce and Brassica vegetables. Vitamin K1 deficiency can result in coagulopathy, a bleeding disorder. Secondary vitamin K deficiency can occur in people with bulimia, those on stringent diets, and those taking anticoagulants. Osteoporosis[51] and coronary heart disease are strongly associated with lower levels of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) Vitamin K2 intake level is inversely related to severe aortic calcification and all-cause mortality.[8]Function in animals is to add a carboxylic acid functional group to a glutamate (Glu) amino acid residue in a animal cell. This is a somewhat uncommon modification of the protein, which is then known as a post-translational modification. The presence of two protein groups on the same carb is known as the ""COOH"" (carboxyl acid) effect. For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percentage of daily value (%DV) For vitamin K labeling purposes the daily value was 80 μg, but as of May 2016 it has been revised upwards to 120 μg. Gla proteins are known to occur in a wide variety of vertebrates: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The venom of a number of Australian snakes acts by activating the human blood-clotting system. In some cases, activation is accomplished by snake Gla-containing enzymes that bind to the endothelium of human blood vessels and catalyze the conversion of procoagulant clotting factors into activated ones. Warfarin and other 4-hydroxycoumarins block the action of VKOR. This results in decreased concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in tissues. It is impossible to predict what dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, so it must be carefully monitored to avoid overdose. The prothrombin time (PT) test measures the time required for blood to clot. A blood sample is mixed with citric acid and put in a fibrometer. This test is insensitive to mild deficiency, as the values do not change until the blood has declined at least 50%.[63] In a study of 53 newborns, 53% found ""prothrom bin time"" to be less than 53 seconds. Plasma phylloquinone was found to be positively correlated with vitamin K intake in elderly British women, but not men. Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (UcOc) levels have been inversely correlated with stores of vitamin K and bone strength in developing rat tibiae. The blood clotting factors of newborn babies are roughly 30–60% that of adult values. Vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25–1.7%, with a prevalence of 2–10 cases per 100,000 births. Premature babies have even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency. Supplementation is recommended for all newborns within the first 24 hours of birth. Intramuscular administration is more effective in preventing late vitamin K deficiency bleed than oral administration. The Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended 0.5–1 mg of vitamins K1 be administered to all newbornS shortly after birth. This single intramususus is usually given as a second-line injection of 1 mg over the first month of life. In the early 1930s, Danish scientist Henrik Dam investigated the role of cholesterol by feeding chickens a cholesterol-depleted diet. Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that – together with the cholesterol – a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. Several laboratories synthesized the compound(s) in 1939. The precise function of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when three laboratories (Stenflo et al.,[87] Nelsestuen et al. and Magnusson et al.) isolated the vitamin K-dependent coagulating factor prothrombin (factor II) from cows that received a high dose of a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. The extra carboxyl group in Gla made clear that vitamin K plays a role in a carboxyglutamate reaction during which Glu is converted into Gla. The biochemistry of how vitamin K is used to convert Glu to Gla has been elucidated over the past thirty years in academic laboratories throughout the world. Vitamin K has been linked to a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. Vitamin K administration to elderly patients with osteoporosis induces no hemostatic activation, even in those with suspected vitamin K deficiency. The American Cancer Society has a guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies (2nd ed.) with information on vitamin K and other minerals. The National Institutes of Health has a program to promote vitamin K use in the U.S. and abroad. The U.N. International Agency for Research on Cancer has a programme to promote the use of vitamin K in the treatment of cancer and other cancer-causing conditions. The World Health Organization has a Program to promote Vitamin K use. The European Food Standards Agency has a Programme to Promote Vitamin K Use in the Treatment of Cancer and Other Conditions. The International Organization for Vitamin K is a not-for-profit organization that promotes vitamin K usage in the United States and other countries. It also provides information on Vitamin K-rich foods and supplements for cancer patients and their families. For more information about vitamin K, visit: www.vitamink.org.uk/.

Lightning is one of the most dramatic effects of electricity.
Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge. In early days, electricity was considered as being not related to magnetism. Later on, many experimental results and the development of Maxwell's equations indicated that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon: electromagnetism. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.
The presence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field.
When a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.
electronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.
Electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.
Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the ""Thunderer of the Nile"", and described them as the ""protectors"" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients suffering from ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them. Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of lightning, and electricity from any other source, is to be attributed to the Arabs, who before the 15th century had the Arabic word for lightning ra‘ad (رعد) applied to the electric ray.
Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.
Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research on electricity in the 18th century, as documented by Joseph Priestley (1767) History and Present Status of Electricity, with whom Franklin carried on extended correspondence.
Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (""of amber"" or ""like amber"", from ἤλεκτρον, elektron, the Greek word for ""amber"") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words ""electric"" and ""electricity"", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.
Further work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.
In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère in 1819–1820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his ""On Physical Lines of Force"" in 1861 and 1862.
While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.
In 1887, Heinrich Hertz:843–44 discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for ""his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels and this is frequently used to make electricity commercially.
The first solid-state device was the ""cat's-whisker detector"" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.
The solid-state device came into its own with the invention of the transistor in 1947. Common solid-state devices include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).
The presence of charge gives rise to an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity.:457 A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated in the late eighteenth century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.
The force acts on the charged particles themselves, hence charge has a tendency to spread itself as evenly as possible over a conducting surface. The magnitude of the electromagnetic force, whether attractive or repulsive, is given by Coulomb's law, which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an inverse-square relation to the distance between them.:35 The electromagnetic force is very strong, second only in strength to the strong interaction, but unlike that force it operates over all distances. In comparison with the much weaker gravitational force, the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart is 1042 times that of the gravitational attraction pulling them together.
Study has shown that the origin of charge is from certain types of subatomic particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an electrically isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire.:2–5 The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.
The charge on electrons and protons is opposite in sign, hence an amount of charge may be expressed as being either negative or positive. By convention, the charge carried by electrons is deemed negative, and that by protons positive, a custom that originated with the work of Benjamin Franklin. The amount of charge is usually given the symbol Q and expressed in coulombs; each electron carries the same charge of approximately −1.6022×10−19 coulomb. The proton has a charge that is equal and opposite, and thus +1.6022×10−19 coulomb. Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle.
The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.
By historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.
The process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second,:17 the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.
Current causes several observable effects, which historically were the means of recognising its presence. That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by Nicholson and Carlisle in 1800, a process now known as electrolysis. Their work was greatly expanded upon by Michael Faraday in 1833. Current through a resistance causes localised heating, an effect James Prescott Joule studied mathematically in 1840.:23–24 One of the most important discoveries relating to current was made accidentally by Hans Christian Ørsted in 1820, when, while preparing a lecture, he witnessed the current in a wire disturbing the needle of a magnetic compass. He had discovered electromagnetism, a fundamental interaction between electricity and magnetics. The level of electromagnetic emissions generated by electric arcing is high enough to produce electromagnetic interference, which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment.
In engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.:11 If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave.:206–07 Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance.:223–25 These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.
The concept of the electric field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.
A hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore zero at all places inside the body.:88 This is the operating principal of the Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects.
The principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30 kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1 kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100 MV and have discharge energies as great as 250 kWh.
A pair of AA cells. The + sign indicates the polarity of the potential difference between the battery terminals.
The concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity.:494–98 This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated.:494–98 The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.
For practical purposes, it is useful to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.
Electric potential is a scalar quantity, that is, it has only magnitude and not direction. It may be viewed as analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.
Ørsted's discovery in 1821 that a magnetic field existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current indicated that there was a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. Moreover, the interaction seemed different from gravitational and electrostatic forces, the two forces of nature then known. The force on the compass needle did not direct it to or away from the current-carrying wire, but acted at right angles to it. Ørsted's slightly obscure words were that ""the electric conflict acts in a revolving manner."" The force also depended on the direction of the current, for if the flow was reversed, then the force did too.
Ørsted did not fully understand his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents in the same direction are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere.
This relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for it led to Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting in a pool of mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet for as long as the current was maintained.
Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 revealed that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.

The ability of chemical reactions to produce electricity, and conversely the ability of electricity to drive chemical reactions has a wide array of uses.
Electrochemistry has always been an important part of electricity. From the initial invention of the Voltaic pile, electrochemical cells have evolved into the many different types of batteries, electroplating and electrolysis cells. Aluminium is produced in vast quantities this way, and many portable devices are electrically powered using rechargeable cells.
A basic electric circuit. The voltage source V on the left drives a current I around the circuit, delivering electrical energy into the resistor R. From the resistor, the current returns to the source, completing the circuit.
An electric circuit is an interconnection of electric components such that electric charge is made to flow along a closed path (a circuit), usually to perform some useful task.
Electric power is the rate at which electric energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.
Electricity generation is often done with electric generators, but can also be supplied by chemical sources such as electric batteries or by other means from a wide variety of sources of energy. Electric power is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry. Electricity is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (3.6 MJ) which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. Electric utilities measure power using electricity meters, which keep a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity is a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high efficiency.
Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, sensors and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system.
Today, most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control. The study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of solid state physics, whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems come under electronics engineering.
Thus, the work of many researchers enabled the use of electronics to convert signals into high frequency oscillating currents, and via suitably shaped conductors, electricity permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances.
Early 20th-century alternator made in Budapest, Hungary, in the power generating hall of a hydroelectric station (photograph by Prokudin-Gorsky, 1905–1915).
In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus experimented with amber rods and these experiments were the first studies into the production of electrical energy. While this method, now known as the triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy. The battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged. For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines.
Electrical power is usually generated by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or from other sources such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention in the late nineteenth century of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.
Since electrical energy cannot easily be stored in quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses.
Electricity is a very convenient way to transfer energy, and it has been adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.
The resistive Joule heating effect employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, it can be seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.
Electricity is used within telecommunications, and indeed the electrical telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications. With the construction of first intercontinental, and then transatlantic, telegraph systems in the 1860s, electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe. Optical fibre and satellite communication have taken a share of the market for communications systems, but electricity can be expected to remain an essential part of the process.
The effects of electromagnetism are most visibly employed in the electric motor, which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric vehicle, is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery, or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph. Electrically powered vehicles are used in public transportation, such as electric buses and trains, and an increasing number of battery-powered electric cars in private ownership.
Electronic devices make use of the transistor, perhaps one of the most important inventions of the twentieth century, and a fundamental building block of all modern circuitry. A modern integrated circuit may contain several billion miniaturised transistors in a region only a few centimetres square.
A voltage applied to a human body causes an electric current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with the path of the current, but is about 0.1 mA to 1 mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.
Electricity is not a human invention, and may be observed in several forms in nature, a prominent manifestation of which is lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure. This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein (πιέζειν), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. The effect is reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field, a small change in physical dimensions takes place.
§Bioelectrogenesis in microbial life is a prominent phenomenon in soils and sediment ecology resulting from anaerobic respiration. The microbial fuel cell mimics this ubiquitous natural phenomenon.
Some organisms, such as sharks, are able to detect and respond to changes in electric fields, an ability known as electroreception, while others, termed electrogenic, are able to generate voltages themselves to serve as a predatory or defensive weapon. The order Gymnotiformes, of which the best known example is the electric eel, detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes. All animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials, whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles. An electric shock stimulates this system, and causes muscles to contract. Action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants.
In the 19th and early 20th century, electricity was not part of the everyday life of many people, even in the industrialised Western world. The popular culture of the time accordingly often depicted it as a mysterious, quasi-magical force that can slay the living, revive the dead or otherwise bend the laws of nature. This attitude began with the 1771 experiments of Luigi Galvani in which the legs of dead frogs were shown to twitch on application of animal electricity. ""Revitalization"" or resuscitation of apparently dead or drowned persons was reported in the medical literature shortly after Galvani's work. These results were known to Mary Shelley when she authored Frankenstein (1819), although she does not name the method of revitalization of the monster. The revitalization of monsters with electricity later became a stock theme in horror films.
As the public familiarity with electricity as the lifeblood of the Second Industrial Revolution grew, its wielders were more often cast in a positive light, such as the workers who ""finger death at their gloves' end as they piece and repiece the living wires"" in Rudyard Kipling's 1907 poem Sons of Martha. Electrically powered vehicles of every sort featured large in adventure stories such as those of Jules Verne and the Tom Swift books. The masters of electricity, whether fictional or real—including scientists such as Thomas Edison, Charles Steinmetz or Nikola Tesla—were popularly conceived of as having wizard-like powers.
With electricity ceasing to be a novelty and becoming a necessity of everyday life in the later half of the 20th century, it required particular attention by popular culture only when it stops flowing, an event that usually signals disaster. The people who keep it flowing, such as the nameless hero of Jimmy Webb’s song ""Wichita Lineman"" (1968), are still often cast as heroic, wizard-like figures.

Basic Concepts of Electricity chapter from Lessons In Electric Circuits Vol 1 DC book and series.","['Watt, one joule per second.']",6197,multifieldqa_en,en,,4c7891d780eb3f45e8c4e5bf14fd9ed6c0bf898fb159b329," Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others. In early days, electricity was considered as being not related to magnetism. Later on, many experimental results and the development of Maxwell's equations indicated that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon: electromagnetism. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society. People were aware of shocks from electric fish before any knowledge of electricity existed. Ancient Egyptian texts referred to these fish as the ""Thunderer of the Nile"", and described them as ""protectors"" of all other fish. Several ancient writers attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete. Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research on electricity in the 18th century, as documented by Joseph Priestley. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère in 1819–1820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz:843–44 discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. The first solid-state device was the ""cat's-whisker detector"" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a ge ge) to create electricity. The presence of charge gives rise to an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other. The magnitude of the electromagnetic force, whether attractive or repulsive, is given by Coulomb's law, which relates the force to the product of the charges. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Study has shown that the origin of charge is from certain types of subatomic particles which have the property of electric charge. The charge on electrons and protons is opposite in sign, hence an amount of charge may be expressed as being either negative or positive. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an electrically isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.manium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. Electric current can consist of any moving charged particles. Most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator. Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle. Current causes several observable effects, which historically were the means of recognising its presence. That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by Nicholson and Carlisle in 1800, a process now known as electrolysis. The level of electromagnetic emissions generated by electric arcing is high enough to produce electromagnetic interference, which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment. Current through a resistance causes localised heating, an effect James Prescott Joule studied mathematically in 1840. Current can be either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) These terms refer to how the current varies in time. The concept of the electric field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the gravitational field, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electricField can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric Field at a distance is usually zero. A hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore zero at all places inside the body.:88 This is the operating principal of the Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects. The principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric fields strength that may be withstood by any medium. Discovery in 1821 that a magnetic field existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current indicated that there was a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. The interaction seemed different from gravitational and electrostatic forces, the two forces of nature then known. The relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for it led to Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 18 21. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Electrochemical cells have evolved into the many different types of batteries, electroplating and electrolysis cells. Aluminium is produced in vast quantities this way, and many portable devices are electrically powered using rechargeable cells. The ability of chemical reactions to produce electricity, and conversely the ability of electricity to drive chemical reactions has a wide array of uses. It is the basis for the international definition of the ampere. Electricity generation is often done with electric generators, but can also be supplied by chemical sources such as electric batteries. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity is a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high efficiency. Electricity is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (3.6 MJ) which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. The study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of solid state physics, whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems come under electronics engineering. In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus experimented with amber rods. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources. Electricity is a very convenient way to transfer energy, and has been adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Electrically powered vehicles are used in public transportation, such as electric buses and trains, and an increasing number of battery-powered electric cars in private ownership. Electricity is still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand. The effects of electromagnetism are most visibly employed in the electric motor, which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A voltage applied to a human body causes an electric current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the great the currere. The resistive Joule heating effect employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. Electricity is not a human invention, and may be observed in several forms in nature. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure.

It has also been used as the name of a type of conductor, the Planar Conductor."
What is the main advantage of a horizontal business model for mobile devices?,"The future of mobile CPUs, part 1: Today’s fork in the road | Ars Technica
2013 may be a big year for the evolution of smartphones and tablets.
Mobile computing's rise from niche market to the mainstream is among the most significant technological trends in our lifetimes. And to a large extent, it's been driven by the bounty of Moore’s Law—the rule that transistor density doubles every 24 months. Initially, most mobile devices relied on highly specialized hardware to meet stringent power and size budgets. But with so many transistors available, devices inevitably grew general-purpose capabilities. Most likely, that wasn't even the real motivation. The initial desire was probably to reduce costs by creating a more flexible software ecosystem with better re-use and faster time to market. As such, the first smartphones were very much a novelty, and it took many years before the world realized the potential of such devices. Apple played a major role by creating innovative smartphones that consumers craved and quickly adopted.
To some extent, this is where we still stand today. Smartphones are still (relatively) expensive and primarily interesting to the developed world. But over the next 10 years, this too will change. As Moore’s Law rolls on, the cost of a low-end smartphone will decline. At some point, the incremental cost will be quite minimal and many feature phones of today will be supplanted by smartphones. A $650 unsubsidized phone is well beyond the reach of most of the world compared to a $20 feature phone, but a $30 to $40 smartphone would naturally be very popular.
In this grand progression, 2013 will certainly be a significant milestone for mobile devices, smartphones and beyond. It's likely to be the first year in which tablets out-ship notebooks in the US. And in the coming years, this will lead to a confluence of high-end tablets and ultra-mobile notebooks as the world figures out how these devices co-exist, blend, hybridize, and/or merge.
Against this backdrop, in this two-part series, we'll explore the major trends and evolution for mobile SoCs. More importantly, we'll look to where the major vendors are likely going in the next several years.
Tablet and phone divergence
While phones and tablets are mobile devices that often share a great deal of software, it's becoming increasingly clear the two are very different products. These two markets have started to diverge and will continue doing so over time.
From a technical perspective, smartphones are far more compact and power constrained. Smartphone SoCs are limited to around 1W, both by batteries and by thermal dissipation. The raison d’etre of a smartphone is connectivity, so a cellular modem is an absolute necessity. For the cost sensitive-models that make up the vast majority of the market, the modem is integrated into the SoC itself. High-end designs favor discrete modems with a greater power budget instead. The main smartphone OSes today are iOS and Android, though Windows is beginning to make an appearance (perhaps with Linux or BlackBerry on the horizon). Just as importantly, phone vendors like HTC must pass government certification and win the approval of carriers. There is very much a walled-garden aspect, where carriers control which devices can be attached to their networks, and in some cases devices can only be sold through a certain carrier. The business model places consumers quite far removed from the actual hardware.
In contrast, tablets are far more akin to the PC both technically and economically. The power budget for tablet SoCs is much greater, up to 4W for a passively cooled device and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans. This alone means there is a much wider range of tablet designs than smartphones. Moreover, the default connectivity for tablets is Wi-Fi rather than a cellular modem. The vast majority of tablets do not have cellular modems, and even fewer customers actually purchase a wireless data plan. As a result, cellular modems are almost always optional discrete components of the platform. The software ecosystem is relatively similar, with Microsoft, Apple, and Google OSes available. Because tablets eschew cellular modems, the time to market is faster, and they are much more commonly sold directly to consumers rather than through carriers. In terms of usage models, tablets are much more PC-like, with reasonable-sized screens that make games and media more attractive.
Looking forward, these distinctions will likely become more pronounced. Many tablets today use high-end smartphone SoCs, but the difference in power targets and expected performance is quite large. As the markets grow in volume, SoCs will inevitably bifurcate to focus on one market or the other. Even today, Apple is doing so, with the A6 for phones and the larger A6X for tablets. Other vendors may need to wait a few years to have the requisite volume, but eventually the two markets will be clearly separate.
Horizontal business model evolution
Another aspect of the mobile device market that is currently in flux and likely to change in the coming years is the business model for the chip and system vendors. Currently, Apple is the only company truly pursuing a vertically integrated model, where all phones and tablets are based on Apple’s own SoC designs and iOS. The tight integration between hardware and software has been a huge boon for Apple, and it has yielded superb products.
Samsung is one of the few others companies that takes a vertically integrated approach to phones and tablets, although in truth its strategy seems to be ambivalent on that point. Unlike Apple, Samsung’s SoCs are readily available to third parties, and some Samsung devices, such as the S7562 Galaxy S Duos, use SoCs from competitors. More recently though, there has been a trend of Samsung devices using Samsung SoCs, at least for the premier products. For the moment, Samsung’s approach is best characterized as a hybrid, particularly as the company lacks a bespoke OS.
The rest of the major SoC vendors (e.g., Intel, Qualcomm, Nvidia, TI, Mediatek, etc.) have stayed pretty far away from actual mobile devices. These companies tend to focus on horizontal business models that avoid competing with customers or suppliers.
In the long term, mobile devices are likely to evolve similarly to the PC and favor a horizontal business model. The real advantage is one of flexibility; as costs drop and the market expands, it will be increasingly necessary for vendors like HTC to offer a wide range of phones based on radically different SoCs. While a vertically integrated company like Apple can focus and maintain leadership in a specific (and highly lucrative) niche, it would be very difficult to expand in many growing areas of the market. The differences between an iPhone 6 and a $20 feature phone are tremendous and would be very difficult for a single company to bridge.
However, SoC vendors will attempt to reap the benefits of vertical integration by providing complete reference platforms to OEMs. Conceptually, this is a form of ""optional"" system integration, where the phone vendor or carrier can get the entire platform from the SoC supplier. This has the principal advantages of reducing time to market while also providing a baseline quality and experience for consumers. Currently, this approach has mostly been tested in emerging markets, but it's likely to become more common over time. There is a crucial distinction between reference platforms and vertical integration. Namely, OEMs can always choose to customize a platform to differentiate, and the SoC vendor avoids dealing with consumers directly. Typically, most of the customization is in terms of software on top of a base operating system.
Quote:Moreover, that will make the transition to a 10nm node even more difficult, as the foundries will have to move from 20nm interconnects to 10nm interconnects and skip a generation.The advances in technology lately allowing components on such a small scale to even be envisioned, much less planned for, are truly amazing.

I present the first generation 'non-technical' rock:
I don't think your horizontal market development theory is supported by facts. Samsung and Apple are more vertically oriented than their competition, for starters. I know this article is narrowly focused on the hardware, but MS and Intel getting into hardware, Amazon getting into hardware, Google buying Moto, this is all vertical integration. How can you support the idea that this trend will be reversed with no real justification? I'm sure mobile chips will continue to specialize, but I don't think this means what you think it means. Automobile companies started making their own engines and with rare exceptions, never went back to being more horizontal. Same with retail and their store brands. Same with cloud companies and their servers. Same with mobile companies and their OSs. The horizontal market of PCs created by long-lasting standards and loose hegemony is the exception, not the norm.
Why wouldn't the foundries be able close the process gap with Intel? Is it a matter of money? Scale?
I'm not so sure about several things:1- Moore's law's relevance. Moore's Law is about ICs. ICs are not as big a part of mobile computers as they are of desktops, even of laptops: screens, batteries, radios are a huge part of tablets' and phones' costs, as opposed to the bare SoC + RAM.2- The tablet vs phone dichotomy. For some reason (probably price insensitivity due to subsidies), Phones have a tendency to be more powerful than Tablets, ie phone SoCs are more than good enough for tablets. Since the OS and peripherals are the same, it makes more sense to design and build just one type of SoC, and just disable the phone-modem part of it (even the other radios are still required: BT, Wifi, GPS...), same as Intel disable cache and cores for their entry-level CPUs. Once you're fabbing a SoC, it makes more sense to make more of the same than to setup a separate run of a cut-down SoC on an older process, unless volumes are huge. We might still be getting previous-generation, well amortized SoCs in cheaper tablets, though.3- On the contrary, I see a tablet and phone convergence (the ugly phablet). I'm patiently waiting for the new 6""+ phones to replace my Nook Color and Galaxy Note 1 with a single device.4- The advantage of diversity ? Software is becoming ever more important than hardware. Multiplying SoCs means multiplying product development costs, making support and updates more difficult... Again, unless volumes are huge, OEMs are probaly better off going the way of the car industry and using modular ""platforms"" housed in different chassis with various screen sizes, keyboards, radios, digitizers...I'm wondering why the ""single device"" trend does not figure in your analysis. Is it stillborn ? Does it have no impact nor dependency on/with SoCs ?
Samsung has its own bespoke OS: Bada and it is used on an extensive line of devices. I think there are numbers somewhere that it outsold Windows Phone 7 for a time.

SoC? System on a Chip I guess?
You're way off on the Moore's Law/cost of smartphones point. The processors used in today's high-end smartphones are already cheap, around $25. And there are less expensive options if you want a lower end product. In fact, the hardware in the whole smartphone is relatively cheap. Analyst's estimate the Z10's materials cost around $160, the iPhone 5 around $140. They're using expensive glass and metals, then there's the battery, memory, etc. which means the processor is a small factor of the cost.And then there's the jump from $140 in materials to the unsubsidized costs. The reason these phones cost $650 is because of the high margins these companies are able to get and the high cost of hardware design and/or software development. But the point is that making the processors 4 times better/cheaper isn't going to change the economics of the smartphone. What will change the economics is commoditized designs and software and cheaper materials all around. Then you'll have a $50 smartphone that's decent.

The margins for desktop and server processors is huge because a) the whole product is expensive so $200 to $1000 for the chip is acceptable, and b) Intel has huge advantages in that space and little competition.So Intel can afford to do the R&D to stay ahead of the curve and keep their position. When your smartphone chip sells for $25 you can't do the R&D to leapfrog a company that sells Xeons for $1000 and Core i5's for $200.
I am happy to see Kanter here at Ars, I like his writing and he maintains Real World Tech, where Linus Torvalds often shows up to comment on CPU arch and other interesting topics.

In that situation, can Intel still justify bringing their A-game to a market where products are essentially commoditised and you have processors selling for a only a few dollars each?The lesson from their previous involvement in the DRAM market is that they probably won't want to be involved because there isn't enough money to be made to justify manufacturing phone SoCs on a cutting edge, or near cutting edge process. In that scenario, Intel may not totally abandon the market but they might just stick to manufacturing SoCs on nodes that are a step or two behind the state of the art.

I know this article is narrowly focused on the hardware, but MS and Intel getting into hardware, Amazon getting into hardware, Google buying Moto, this is all vertical integration. How can you support the idea that this trend will be reversed with no real justification? I'm sure mobile chips will continue to specialize, but I don't think this means what you think it means. Automobile companies started making their own engines and with rare exceptions, never went back to being more horizontal. Same with retail and their store brands. Same with cloud companies and their servers. Same with mobile companies and their OSs. The horizontal market of PCs created by long-lasting standards and loose hegemony is the exception, not the norm.Yea, each year Amazon, MS, Apple and Google look more and more the same.
Intel cannot abandon the phone/tablet market. Desktop/laptop sales are stagnating/decreasing and phones/tablets are on the rise. This trend is only going to increase going forward.But you're right, they're going to have use their fabs that are a step or two behind the cutting the edge. But they're going to have to up their game in the tablet space to even be able to do that.

If Intel can stay ahead in process design - which this article seems to indicate - they should have a major advantage. All else being equal a 14nm chip should be significantly faster and more efficient than the same chip at 22nm. Add in the fact that yields increase geometrically - you can fit a lot more 14nm chips on a given wafer size vs 22nm (or 32nm for the other manufacturers.) and you have a very appealing proposition. And then add in the fact that Intel actually has a pretty good graphics stack and IP. It's not a sure thing by any means, but I suspect ARM may have just prodded a sleeping giant.edit: Also worth noting, Intel, TSMC, and Samsung are the only manufacturers who are building out 450nm wafers. This will increase yields dramatically. Of course Samsung and TSMC will build ARM out, but it definitely puts quite a bit of pressure on all other manufacturers. As the article mentions Intel and Samsung are the only ones who control production top to bottom, and Samsung must share some of the benefits with ARM.

The reason desktop/laptop sales are stagnating/decreasing is due to the fact that most people already have one and therefore don't need to buy another one. The exact same thing will happen with tablets as well. Sales are increasing now because people without tablets are buying them. When most people already own a tablet, they won't be buying a new one every year and therefore sales will stagnate/decrease.The PC market is saturated and in a couple of years, the tablet market will be saturated too. Basically, in order to increase sales in a saturated market, you need to increase the population growth or decrease the longevity of the product.
gypsumfantastic wrote:Why wouldn't the foundries be able close the process gap with Intel? Is it a matter of money? Scale?Probably a mix of a lot of things. One big thing was during this recession, Intel was the ONLY fab company that didn't scale back their R&D. That alone gave Intel a large advantage.Intel has almost always been ahead. One of the reasons could be that Intel works with much higher margins than many of the commodity companies like Samsung and TSMC.Outside of the P4 flop and some of the monopolistic abuses, Intel has typically been selling to high end customers that are willing to pay a premium for ""the best"".Intel has a large benefit of having a relatively ""good name"" when it comes to CPUs, so they can effectively charge a brand-name premium.I'm sure there are other reasons, and probably better reasons, but these are the main ones that I think of.

I think the assumption is that, as you say, the tablet market will saturate, with people just replacing existing ones, but the desktop/laptop market could decrease much farther than that, if most people stop replacing them at all. I'm not sure of the likelihood of that, but I think that's where this idea comes from.

Apple once again is dictating the performance in the mobile industry. Nice to see others being able to keep the pace, as well.

Doesn't change the fact that cars would probably have been an asterisk in the history books under ""toys for rich people"" if it weren't for him.The same applies to to mobile computing for Apple, Samsung, et al.

If the SoC market becomes increasingly commoditised, there isn't going to be the money to justify making them in a state of the art fab.Remember that one of the big selling points of Itanium was that it would make use of process advantages that were effectively paid for by the mainstream x86 market. That didn't quite work out in practice and Itanium processors were often well behind Xeons in process technology.

If we see a race to the bottom where price is the dominant motivator behind purchases, then a high performance SoC will struggle to make its mark.

The industry simply would not exist TODAY without the overwhelming horizontal integration that already dominates.
Quote:In the long term, mobile devices are likely to evolve similarly to the PC and favor a horizontal business model. The real advantage is one of flexibility; as costs drop and the market expands, it will be increasingly necessary for vendors like HTC to offer a wide range of phones based on radically different SoCs. You don't mention in the article that each SoC necessarily requires a bit of parallel dev work unlike the PC. In the PC world there is a standard BIOS and HW architecture that allows for pluggable designs. On a highly integrated SoC this is untrue. HTC suffers because it has to support radically different SoCs, their drivers and boot loaders, etc. Quote:While a vertically integrated company like Apple can focus and maintain leadership in a specific (and highly lucrative) niche, it would be very difficult to expand in many growing areas of the market. The differences between an iPhone 6 and a $20 feature phone are tremendous and would be very difficult for a single company to bridge.It's only difficult because Apple chooses to ignore that market, not because they can't. If they can release a $99 Apple TV, they can surely cobble together a $20 feature phone if they chose to eschew 8GB of NAND, BT, WiFi, a specialized dock connector, LTE, and their specialized processors. In other words, build the equivalent of an iPod shuffle with a horrible screen and no OS to speak of.

The industry simply would not exist TODAY without the overwhelming horizontal integration that already dominates.Yes the efforts of these companies getting cellular communications standardized were immense. And the technology matured. And then they didn't do much with it. It took some youngin's to look at the problem fresh and add the UI that make today's smartphones work. As we have all seen, the moment your technology has matured is the moment you are screwed because someone else now has the opportunity to look at it as a black box and make something new. Each of those manufacturers knew that smartphones would eventually be awesome, but none of them had the UI and software design to make a truly breakout product. Imagine if Motorola would have been smart enough to buy the Android guys instead of Google. Instead, Google bought a bunch of patents on that cellular black box to try to defend it's platform.And when you think about it, which consumes more man years of engineering effort per year at this point.... iterating that cellular black box or developing the OS, services and apps that power today's smartphones?
Intel had better decide that they are competing in this space ""for real"", or they are screwed. They've already let the Atom languish for five years, during which ARM has completely caught up in performance.Just like Tim Cook said, if you don't cannibalize your own markets someone else will do it for you.Whether Intel will embrace that concept in time remains to be seen. Personally, I hope they don't; if Intel transforms into a chipless Fab company (like TSMC) everyone benefits.
I still think Samsung has the advantage long term because they have both the SOC and the memory products. As mentioned in the article, TSV's (Through Silicon Via's) are going to be quite a disruption. Today, people normally stack an LPDDR2 package on top of their SOC package (POP or Package On Package). Within the LPDDR2 package, you could have a stack of DRAM die typically with wire bonding connecting the die within the package.Once you more to TSV's, you can have a LOT more connections between the SOC and its DRAM's. While this is being standardized through JEDEC (http://www.jedec.org/category/technolog ... a/3d-ics-0), Samsung has all the pieces in house to do whatever they want. You could see a 512 bit or higher bus from the SOC to the memory. The trick is that the memory and the SOC need to line up with each other when you stack them. This gives Samsung an inherent advantage.This isn't just going to impact mobile either. Take a look at that JEDEC link. It also lists High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). This is a 1024 bit bus that provides 128GBytes/s to 256GBytes/s of bandwidth to a stack of up to 8 DRAM's. Here is your processor that includes 8-16 cores and 4GBytes of really, really, fast DRAM... No DIMMs required. How many of them do you want in your server rack?If I was Intel or Apple, I would be thinking seriously about making some investments in Micron to guarantee they make some compelling DRAM's to integrate with their SOC's and processors... otherwise Samsung is going to blow them out of the water on bandwidth.

The Z2760 is even 32nm vs 28nm of the latest Krait and A15 chips.But that's all changing with Atom moving to the tick tock schedule this year. It wouldn't even surprise me to see Apple move to Intel chips for IOS.And I don't see how Intel moving to a chipless Fab company would help everyone. It certainly wouldn't help Intel.

I'm not sure the tablet market will saturate in a ""couple of years."" It may be more like 5 years. But that's a quibble.Here's the real issue. Right now Apple wants you to own an iPhone AND iPad AND Macbook AND iWatch AND Apple TV. Microsoft, OTOH, is making the Surface so that you could ditch your laptop and just use a Surface. Not everyone, but some people.If 5 years from now, we're in a world where a significant number of people use a Surface-type device instead of a laptop, then the PC market is going to contract significantly. Maybe some of the tablet-like devices will use moderately expensive Intel chips, but some of them are going to use cheaper chips.

As Moore’s Law rolls on, the cost of a low-end smartphone will decline. It's likely to be the first year in which tablets out-ship notebooks in the US. And in the coming years, this will lead to a confluence of high-end tablets and ultra-mobile notebooks as the world figures out how these devices co-exist, blend, hybridize, and/or merge. The power budget for tablet SoCs is much greater, up to 4W for a passively cooled device and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans. This alone means there is a much wider range of tablet designs than smartphones. The default connectivity for tablets is Wi-Fi rather than a cellular modem. The vast majority of tablets do not have cellular modems, and even fewer customers actually purchase a wireless data plan. The main smartphone OSes today are iOS and Android, though Windows is beginning to make an appearance (perhaps with Linux or BlackBerry on the horizon) Apple is the only company truly pursuing a vertically integrated model. Samsung’s approach is best characterized as a hybrid, particularly as the company lacks a bespoke OS. In the long term, mobile devices are likely to evolve similarly to the PC and favor a horizontal business model. As costs drop and the market expands, it will be increasingly necessary for vendors like HTC to offer a wide range of phones based on radically different SoCs. The advances in technology lately allowing components on such a sma sma.ost always optional discrete components of the platform. The software ecosystem is relatively similar, with Microsoft, Apple, and Google OSes available. Because tablets eschew cellular modems, the time to market is faster, and they are much more commonly sold directly to consumers rather than through carriers. The difference in power targets and expected performance is quite large. The differences between an iPhone 6 and a $20 feature phone are tremendous and would be very difficult for a single company to bridge. The real advantage is one of flexibility. Mobile chips will continue to specialize, but I don't think this means what you think it means. Moore's Law is about ICs. ICs are not as big a part of mobile computers as they are of desktops, even of laptops. Software is becoming ever more important than hardware. Multiplying SoCs means multiplying product development costs, making support and updates more difficult. I see a tablet and phone convergence (the ugly phablet) I'm patiently waiting for the new 6""+ phones to replace my Nook Color and Galaxy Note 1 with a single device. I'm wondering why the ""single device"" trend does not figure in your analysis. Is it stillborn? Does it have no impact nor dependency on/with SoCs?Samsung has its own bespoke OS: Bada and it is used on an extensive line of devices. I think there are numbers somewhere that it outsold Windows Phone 7 for a time. Amazon getting into hardware, Google buying Moto, this is all vertical integration. The horizontal market of PCs created by long-lasting standards and loose hegemony is the exception, not the norm. Intel are able to piggyback other development efforts off the highly lucrative mainstream x86 market which generates the huge sums of money to fund their amazing fab technology. When your smartphone chip sells for $25 you can't do the R&D to leapfrog a company that sells Xeons for $1000 and Core i5's for $200. The question for the future is how the economics will stack up when overall device costs fall significantly and there is a big downward pressure on SoC prices. In that scenario, Intel may not totally abandon the market but they might just stick to manufacturing SoCs on nodes that are a step or two behind the state of the art. The only products using 3D integration are FPGAs from Xilinx,Doesn't Sony use it in the PS Vita? I thought I read somewhere that they had the CPU, main memory (2 dies) and video memory, so 4 dies in total, sitting on top of each other all on the same chip. I don't think your horizontal market development theory is supported by facts. Samsung and Apple are more vertically oriented than Intel. Intel cannot abandon the phone/tablet market. Desktop/laptop sales are stagnating/decreasing and phones/tablets are on the rise. The true innovation in the mobile market was done a decade or more ago mainly by Moto/Nokia/Ericsson/TI/Qualcomm, and Samsung and Apple had little to do with it. Google buying Moto, this is all vertical integration. How can you support the idea that this trend will be reversed with no real justification? I'm sure mobile chips will continue to specialize, but I don't think this means what you think it means. Under the hood most stuff has been on a simple linear evolutionary path by the SoC.

If Intel can stay ahead in process design - which this article seems to indicate - they should have a major advantage. The question for the future is how the economics will stack up when overall device costs fall significantly and there is a big downward pressure on SoC prices. In that situation, can Intel still justify bringing their A-game to a market where products are essentially commoditised and you have processors selling for a only a few dollars each? The lesson from their previous involvement in the DRAM market is that they probably won't want to be involved because there isn't enough money to be made to justify manufacturing phone SoCs on a cutting edge, or near cutting edge process.Yeah, and most of the innovation in the automobile industry came about before Henry Ford came into the business. Doesn't change the fact that cars would probably have been an asterisk in the history books under ""toys for rich people"" if it weren't for him. The true innovation in the mobile market was done a decade or more ago mainly by Moto/Nokia/Ericsson/TI/Qualcomm, and Samsung and Apple had little to do with it. Under the hood most stuff has been on a simple linear evolutionary path by the SoC providers since then. If we see a race to the bottom where price is the dominant motivator behind purchases, then a high performance SoC will struggle to make its mark. The word you're looking for is Haswell, as far as I know. If tablets move into the $100-200 range, is there going to be room for Haswell? So long as there is a higher-end tablet market, then Haswell will be able to shine, but it will be a much more powerful and costly part than the sort of ARM based hardware that often runs tablets. The true innovation is in the phone/tablet market. Desktop/laptop sales are stagnating/decreasing and phones/tablets are on the rise. This trend is only going to increase going forward. Acorn and Apple invented the mobile ARM CPU in the first place. The industry simply would not exist TODAY without the overwhelming horizontal integration that already dominates. The true innovation in the mobile market was done a decade or more ago mainly by Moto/Nokia/Ericsson/TI/Qualcomm, and Samsung and Apple had little to do with it. If they can release a $99 Apple TV, they can surely cobble together a $20 feature phone if they chose to eschew 8GB of NAND, BT, WiFi, a specialized dock connector, LTE, and their specialized processors. In other words, build the equivalent of an iPod shuffle with a horrible screen and no OS to speak of. You don't mention in the article that each SoC necessarily requires a bit of parallel dev work unlike the PC. In the PC world there is a standard BIOS and HW architecture that allows for pluggable designs. On a highly integrated SoC this is untrue. HTC suffers because it has to support radically different SoCs, their drivers and boot loaders, etc. Acorn and Apple invented the mobile ARM CPU in the first place. All those companies you've mentioned have just been working off Acorn's pioneering work. It took some youngin's to look at the problem fresh and add the UI that make today's smartphones work. As we have all seen, the moment your technology has matured is the moment you are screwed. If you don't cannibalize your own markets someone else will do it for you.Whether Intel will embrace that concept in time remains to be seen. If Intel transforms into a chipless Fab company (like TSMC) everyone benefits. I still think Samsung has the advantage long term because they have both the SOC and the memory products. As mentioned in the article, TSV's (Through Silicon Via's) are going to be quite a disruption. While this is being standardized through JEDEC (http://www.jedec.org/category/technolog... a/3d-ics-0), Samsung has all the pieces in house to do whatever they want. You could see a 512 bit or higher bus from the SOC to the memory. Intel's Atom has stood still for too long, but honestly it's pretty amazing how Atom is still competitive with current ARM chips. The Z2760 is even 32nm vs 28nm of the latest Krait and A15 chips. It wouldn't even surprise me to see Apple move to Intel chips for IOS. I don't see how Intel moving to a chipless Fab company would help everyone. It certainly wouldn't help Intel. I still think Samsung has the advantage long term because they have both the SOC and the memory products. As mentioned in the article, TSV's (Through Silicon Via's) are going to be quite a disruption. If I was Intel or Apple, I would be thinking seriously about making some investments in Micron to guarantee they make some compelling DRAM's to integrate with their SOC's and processors... otherwise Samsung is going to blow them out of the water on bandwidth. I'm not sure the tablet market will saturate in a ""couple of years"" It may be more like 5 years. When most people already own a tablet, they won't be buying a new one every year and therefore sales will stagnate/decrease. Samsung has all the pieces in house to do whatever they want. You could see a 512 bit or higher bus from the SOC to the memory. The trick is that the memory and the SOC need to line up with each other when you stack them. This gives Samsung an inherent advantage. Why not AMD? Last I checked they still made memory...and processors/GPUs."
Who was Brooksley Elizabeth's first husband?,"Brooksley Elizabeth Born (born August 27, 1940) is an American attorney and former public official who, from August 26, 1996, to June 1, 1999, was chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the federal agency which oversees the U.S. futures and commodity options markets. During her tenure on the CFTC, Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of off-exchange markets for derivatives, in addition to its role with respect to exchange-traded derivatives, but her warnings were ignored or dismissed, and her calls for reform resisted by other regulators.<ref name=""nytimes"">Goodman, Peter S. The Reckoning - Taking Hard New Look at a Greenspan Legacy, The New York Times, October 9, 2008.</ref> Born resigned as chairperson on June 1, 1999, shortly after Congress passed legislation prohibiting her agency from regulating derivatives.

In 2009, Born received the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award, along with Sheila Bair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in recognition of the ""political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed"" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Early life and education
Born graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco, California) at the age of 16. She then attended Stanford University, where she majored in English and was graduated with the class of 1961.  She initially wanted to become a doctor, but a guidance counsellor at Stanford advised her against medicine, so she majored in English literature instead.

She then attended Stanford Law School, one of only seven women in her class.  She was the first female student ever to be named president of the Stanford Law Review. She received the ""Outstanding Senior"" award and graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1964.

Legal career
Immediately after law school Born was selected as a law clerk to judge Henry Edgerton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It was during this time that she met her first husband, Jacob C. Landau, who was a journalist covering the Federal courts at the time. Following her clerkship, she became an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based international law firm of Arnold & Porter. Born was attracted to Arnold & Porter because it was one of the few major law firms to have a woman partner at that time, Carolyn Agger, who was the head of the tax practice. Born took a two-year leave of absence from Arnold & Porter to accompany her first husband to Boston, where he had received a fellowship. During that time she worked as a research assistant to law professor Alan Dershowitz.

Born's early career at Arnold & Porter focused on international trade law, in which she represented a number of Swiss industries and the government of Switzerland. She developed a practice representing clients in numerous complex litigation and arbitration cases involving financial market transactions. Among her high-profile cases was the matter of the Hunt Brothers attempt to corner the market in silver in the 1970s. She made partner at Arnold & Porter, after moving to a three-day schedule to help raise her second child, and eventually rose to be the head of the firm's derivatives practice.

Born was among the first female attorneys to systematically address inequities regarding how the laws treated women. Born and another female lawyer, Marna Tucker, taught what is considered to have been the first ""Women and the Law"" course at Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law. The class exclusively concerned prejudicial treatment of women under the laws of the United States, past and present.  Born and Tucker were surprised to discover that there was no textbook on the issue at the time.  Born is also one of the co-founders of the National Women's Law Center. Born also helped rewrite the American Bar Association rules to make it possible for more women and minorities to sit on federal bench.

During her long legal career, and into her retirement, Born did much pro bono and other types of volunteer work. She was active in the American Bar Association, the largest professional organization of lawyers in the United States.  Initially Born was named a member of the governing council of the ABA's Individual Rights Section, eventually becoming chairperson.  Born and Tucker founded the ABA Women's Caucus, the first organization of female lawyers in the ABA.  She held several other senior positions in the ABA, including being named the first woman member of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Born provided testimony and opinion on persons nominated for federal judgeships. In 1980 she was named chair of the committee.  As chair of the committee, Born was invited to address the U.S. Congress regarding the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In 1993, Born's name was floated as a possible candidate for Attorney General of the United States, but Janet Reno was nominated.

In July 2009, Nancy Pelosi appointed Brooksley Born as a commissioner to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC).

Born and the OTC derivatives market
Born was appointed to the CFTC on April 15, 1994, by President Bill Clinton. Due to litigation against Bankers Trust Company by Procter and Gamble and other corporate clients, Born and her team at the CFTC sought comments on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, a first step in the process of writing CFTC regulations to supplement the existing regulations of the Federal Reserve System,  the Options Clearing Corporation, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Born was particularly concerned about swaps, financial instruments that are traded over the counter between banks, insurance companies or other funds or companies, and thus have no transparency except to the two counterparties and the counterparties' regulators, if any.  CFTC regulation was strenuously opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. On May 7, 1998, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt joined Rubin and Greenspan in objecting to the issuance of the CFTC's concept release. Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a ""legal uncertainty"" regarding such financial instruments,  hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would ""stifle financial innovation"" and encourage financial capital to transfer its  transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies,  insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies.

In 1998, a trillion-dollar hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was near collapse.  Using mathematical models to calculate debt risk, LTCM used derivatives to leverage $5 billion into more than $1 trillion, doing business with fifteen of Wall Street's largest financial institutions.  The derivative transactions were not regulated, nor were investors able to evaluate LTCM's exposures.  Born stated, ""I thought that LTCM was exactly what I had been worried about"".  In the last weekend of September 1998, the President's working group was told that the entire American economy hung in the balance.  After intervention by the Federal Reserve, the crisis was averted.  In congressional hearings into the crisis, Greenspan acknowledged that language had been introduced into an agriculture bill that would prevent CFTC from regulating the derivatives which were at the center of the crisis that threatened the US economy.  U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) asked ""How many more failures do you think we'd have to have before some regulation in this area might be appropriate?""  In response, Greenspan brushed aside the substance of Born's warnings with the simple assertion that ""the degree of supervision of regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system"". Born's warning was that there wasn't any regulation of them.  Born's chief of staff, Michael Greenberger summed up Greenspan's position this way: ""Greenspan didn't believe that fraud was something that needed to be enforced, and he assumed she probably did. And of course, she did.""  Under heavy pressure from the financial lobby, legislation prohibiting regulation of derivatives by Born's agency was passed by the Congress.  Born resigned on June 1, 1999.

The derivatives market continued to grow yearly throughout both terms of George W. Bush's administration. On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers forced a broad recognition of a financial crisis in both the US and world capital markets.  As Lehman Brothers' failure temporarily reduced financial capital's confidence, a number of newspaper articles and television programs suggested that the failure's possible causes included the conflict between the CFTC and the other regulators.Faiola, Anthony, Nakashima, Ellen and Drew, Jill. The Crash: Risk and Regulation - What Went Wrong, The Washington Post, October 15, 2008.

Born declined to publicly comment on the unfolding 2008 crisis until March 2009, when she said: ""The market grew so enormously, with so little oversight and regulation, that it made the financial crisis much deeper and more pervasive than it otherwise would have been."" She also lamented the influence of Wall Street lobbyists on the process and the refusal of regulators to discuss even modest reforms.

An October 2009 Frontline documentary titled ""The Warning""  described Born's thwarted efforts to regulate and bring transparency to the derivatives market, and the continuing opposition thereto. The program concluded with an excerpted interview with Born sounding another warning: ""I think we will have continuing danger from these markets and that we will have repeats of the financial crisis -- may differ in details but there will be significant financial downturns and disasters attributed to this regulatory gap, over and over, until we learn from experience.""

In 2009 Born, along with Sheila Bair of the FDIC, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in recognition of the ""political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed"" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.  According to Caroline Kennedy, ""Brooksley Born recognized that the financial security of all Americans was being put at risk by the greed, negligence and opposition of  powerful and well connected interests.... The catastrophic financial events of recent months have  proved them [Born and Sheila Bair] right.""  One member of the President's working group had a change of heart about Brooksley Born.  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt stated ""I've come to know her as one of the most capable, dedicated, intelligent and committed public servants that I have ever come to know"", adding that ""I could have done much better. I could have made a difference"" in response to her warnings.

In 2010, a documentary film Inside Job further alleged that derivatives regulation was ineffective from the Clinton administration on. Along with fellow whistleblower, former IMF Chief Economist Raghuram Rajan, who was also scorned by the economic establishment, Brooksley Born was cited as one of the authorities arguing that financial derivatives increase economic risk.

 Personal life 
Born is married to Alexander E. Bennett (also retired from Arnold & Porter).  She has five adult children - two from a previous marriage to Jacob Landau and three stepchildren. Notably, Born was named a partner at Arnold & Porter while working part-time so she could raise her two young children.  When both of her children were school-age, Born returned to practice full-time.

abstract

Explicit communication among humans is key to coordinating and learning. Social learning, which uses cues from experts, can greatly benefit from the usage of explicit communication to align heterogeneous policies, reduce sample complexity, and solve partially observable tasks. Emergent communication, a type of explicit communication, studies the creation of an artificial language to encode a high task-utility message directly from data.
However, in most cases, emergent communication sends insufficiently compressed messages with little or null information, which also may not be understandable to a third-party listener. This paper proposes an unsupervised method based on the information bottleneck to capture both referential complexity and task-specific utility to adequately explore sparse social communication scenarios in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).
We show that our model is able to i) develop a natural-language-inspired lexicon of messages that is independently composed of a set of emergent concepts, which span the observations and intents with minimal bits, ii) develop communication to align the action policies of heterogeneous agents with dissimilar feature models, and iii) learn a communication policy from watching an expert's action policy, which we term 'social shadowing'.

INTRODUCTION

Social learning agents analyze cues from direct observation of other agents (novice or expert) in the same environment to learn an action policy from others. However, observing expert actions may not be sufficient to coordinate with other agents. Rather, by learning to communicate, agents can better model the intent of other agents, leading to better coordination.
In humans, explicit communication for coordination assumes a common communication substrate to convey abstract concepts and beliefs directly , which may not be available for new partners. To align complex beliefs, heterogeneous agents must learn a message policy that translates from one theory of mind to another to synchronize coordination.
Especially when there is complex information to process and share, new agent partners need to learn to communicate to work with other agents. Emergent communication studies the creation of artificial language. Often phrased as a Lewis game, speakers and listeners learn a set of tokens to communicate complex observations .
However, in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents suffer from partial observability and non-stationarity (due to unaligned value functions) , which aims to be solved with decentralized learning through communication. In the MARL setup, agents, as speakers and listeners, learn a set of tokens to communicate observations, intentions, coordination, or other experiences which help facilitate solving tasks .
Agents learn to communicate effectively through a backpropagation signal from their task performance . This has been found useful for applications in human-agent teaming , multirobot navigation , and coordination in complex games such as StarCraft II . Communication quality has been shown to have a strong relationship with task performance , leading to a multitude of work attempting to increase the representational capacity by decreasing the convergence rates .
Yet these methods still create degenerate communication protocols , which are uninterpretable due to joined concepts or null (lack of) information, which causes performance degradation. In this work, we investigate the challenges of learning a arXiv:2302.14276v1 LG] 28 Feb 2023 messaging lexicon to prepare emergent communication for social learning (EC4SL) scenarios.
We study the following hypotheses: H1) EC4SL will learn faster through structured concepts in messages leading to higher-quality solutions, H2) EC4SL aligns the policies of expert heterogeneous agents, and H3) EC4SL enables social shadowing, where an agent learns a communication policy while only observing an expert agent's action policy.
By learning a communication policy, the agent is encouraged to develop a more structured understanding of intent, leading to better coordination. The setting is very realistic among humans and many computer vision and RL frameworks may develop rich feature spaces for a specific solo task, but have not yet interacted with other agents, which may lead to failure without alignment.
We enable a compositional emergent communication paradigm, which exhibits clustering and informativeness properties. We show theoretically and through empirical results that compositional language enables independence properties among tokens with respect to referential information. Additionally, when combined with contrastive learning, our method outperforms competing methods that only ground communication on referential information.
We show that contrastive learning is an optimal critic for communication, reducing sample complexity for the unsupervised emergent communication objective. In addition to the more human-like format, compositional communication is able to create variable-length messages, meaning that we are not limited to sending insufficiently compressed messages with little information, increasing the quality of each communication.
In order to test our hypotheses, we show the utility of our method in multi-agent settings with a focus on teams of agents, high-dimensional pixel data, and expansions to heterogeneous teams of agents of varying skill levels. Social learning requires agents to explore to observe and learn from expert cues.
We interpolate between this form of social learning and imitation learning, which learns action policies directly from examples. We introduce a 'social shadowing' learning approach where we use first-person observations, rather than third-person observations, to encourage the novice to learn latently or conceptually how to communicate and develop an understanding of intent for better coordination.
The social shadowing episodes are alternated with traditional MARL during training. Contrastive learning, which works best with positive examples, is apt for social shadowing. Originally derived to enable lower complexity emergent lexicons, we find that the contrastive learning objective is apt for agents to develop internal models and relationships of the task through social shadowing.
The idea is to enable a shared emergent communication substrate (with minimal bandwidth) to enable future coordi-nation with novel partners. Our contributions are deriving an optimal critic for a communication policy and showing that the information bottleneck helps extend communication to social learning scenarios.
In real-world tasks such as autonomous driving or robotics, humans do not necessarily learn from scratch. Rather they explore with conceptually guided information from expert mentors. In particular, having structured emergent messages reduces sample complexity, and contrastive learning can help novice agents learn from experts.
Emergent communication can also align heterogeneous agents, a social task that has not been previously studied.

Multi-Agent Signaling

Implicit communication conveys information to other agents that is not intentionally communicated . Implicit signaling conveys information to other agents based on one's observable physical position . Implicit signaling may be a form of implicit communication such as through social cues or explicit communication such as encoded into the MDP through ""cheap talk"" .
Unlike implicit signaling, explicit signaling is a form of positive signaling that seeks to directly influence the behavior of other agents in the hopes that the new information will lead to active listening. Multi-agent emergent communication is a type of explicit signaling which deliberately shares information.
Symbolic communication, a subset of explicit communication, seeks to send a subset of pre-defined messages. However, these symbols must be defined by an expert and do not scale to particularly complex observations and a large number of agents. Emergent communication aims to directly influence other agents with a learned subset of information, which allows for scalability and interpretability by new agents.

Emergent Communication

Several methodologies currently exist to increase the informativeness of emergent communication. With discrete and clustered continuous communication, the number of observed distinct communication tokens is far below the number permissible . As an attempt to increase the emergent ""vocabulary"" and decrease the data required to converge to an informative communication ""language"", work has added a bias loss to emit distinct tokens in different situations .
More recent work has found that the sample efficiency can be further improved by grounding communication in observation space with a supervised reconstruction loss . Information-maximizing autoencoders aim to maximize the state reconstruction accuracy for each agent. How-ever, grounding communication in observations has been found to easily satisfy these input-based objectives while still requiring a myriad more samples to explore to find a task-specific communication space .
Thus, it is necessary to use task-specific information to communicate informatively. This will enable learned compression for task completion rather than pure compression for input recovery. Other work aims to use the information bottleneck to decrease the entropy of messages . In our work, we use contrastive learning to increase representation similarity with future goals, which we show optimally optimizes the Q-function for messages.

Natural Language Inspiration

The properties of the tokens in emergent communication directly affect their informative ability. As a baseline, continuous communication tokens can represent maximum information but lack human-interpretable properties. Discrete 1-hot (binary vector) tokens allow for a finite vocabulary, but each token contains the same magnitude of information, with equal orthogonal distance to each other token.
Similar to word embeddings in natural language, discrete prototypes are an effort to cluster similar information together from continuous vectors . Building on the continuous word embedding properties, VQ-VIB , an information-theoretic observation grounding based on VQ-VAE properties , uses variational properties to provide word embedding properties for continuous emergent tokens.
Like discrete prototypes, they exhibit a clustering property based on similar information but are more informative. However, each of these message types determines a single token for communication. Tokens are stringed together to create emergent ""sentences"".

Preliminaries

We formulate our setup as a decentralized, partially observable Markov Decision Process with communication (Dec-POMDP-Comm). Formally, our problem is defined by the tuple, S, A, M, T , R, O, Ω, γ . We define S as the set of states, A i , i ∈ [1, N ] as the set of actions, which includes task-specific actions, and M i as the set of communications for N agents.
T is the transition between states due to the multi-agent joint action space T : S × A 1 , ..., A N → S. Ω defines the set of observations in our partially observable setting. Partial observability requires communication to complete the tasks successfully. O i : M 1 , ..., M N × Ŝ → Ω maps the communications and local state, Ŝ, to a distribution of observations for each agent.
R defines the reward function and γ defines the discount factor.

Architecture

The policy network is defined by three stages: Observation Encoding, Communication, and Action Decoding. The best observation encoding and action decoding architecture is task-dependent, i.e., using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), CNNs , GRUs , or transformer layers are best suited to different inputs.
The encoder transforms observation and any sequence or memory information into an encoding H. The on-policy reinforcement learning training uses RE-INFORCE or a decentralized version of MAPPO as specified by our experiments. Our work focuses on the communication stage, which can be divided into three substages: message encoding, message passing (often considered sparse communication), and message decoding.
We use the message passing from . For message decoding, we build on a multiheaded attention framework, which allows an agent to learn which messages are most important . Our compositional communication framework defines the message encoding, as described in section 4.

Objective

Mutual information, denoted as I(X; Y ), looks to measure the relationship between random variables, which is often measured through Kullback-Leibler divergence , I(X; Y ) = D KL (p(x, y)||p(x) ⊗ p(y)). The message encoding substage can be defined as an information bottleneck problem, which defines a tradeoff between the complexity of information (compression, I(X, X)) and the preserved relevant information (utility, I( X, Y )).
The deep variational information bottleneck defines a trade-off between preserving useful information and compression . We assume that our observation and memory/sequence encoder provides an optimal representation H i suitable for sharing relevant observation and intent/coordination information. We hope to recover a representation Y i , which contains the sufficient desired outputs.
In our scenario, the information bottleneck is a trade-off between the complexity of information I(H i ; M i ) (representing the encoded information exactly) and representing the relevant information I(M j =i ; Y i ), which is signaled from our contrastive objective. In our setup, the relevant information flows from other agents through communication, signaling a combination of the information bottleneck and a Lewis game.
We additionally promote complexity through our compositional independence objective, This is formulated by the following Lagrangian, where the bounds on mutual information Î are defined in equations 1, 2, and 10. Overall, our objective is,

Complexity through Compositional Communication

We aim to satisfy the complexity objective, I(H i , M i ), through compositional communication. In order to induce complexity in our communication, we want the messages to be as non-random as possible. That is, informative with respect to the input hidden state h. In addition, we want each token within the message to share as little information as possible with the preceding tokens.
Thus, each additional token adds only informative content. Each token has a fixed length in bits W . The total sequence is limited by a fixed limit, L l W l ≤ S, of S bits and a total of L tokens. We use a variational message generation setup, which maps the encoded hidden state h to a message m; that is, we are modeling the posterior, π i m (m l |h).
We limit the vocabulary size to K tokens, e j ∈ R D , j ∈ [1, K] ⊂ N, where each token has dimensionality D and l ∈ [1, L] ⊂ N. Each token m l is sampled from a categorical posterior distribution, 0 otherwise such that the message m l is mapped to the nearest neighbor e j . A set of these tokens makes a message m.
To satisfy the complexity objective, we want to use m i to well-represent h i and consist of independently informative m i l .

Independent Information

We derive an upper bound for the interaction information between all tokens. Proposition 4.1. For the interaction information between all tokens, the following upper bound holds: The proof is in Appendix A.1. Since we want the mutual information to be minimized in our objective, we minimize,

Input-Oriented Information

In order to induce complexity in the compositional messages, we additionally want to minimize the mutual information I(H; M ) between the composed message m and the encoded information h. We derive an upper bound on the mutual information that we use as a Lagrangian term to minimize. Proposition 4.2. For the mutual information between the composed message and encoded information, the following upper bound holds:
The proof is in Appendix A.1. Thus, we have our Lagrangian term, Conditioning on the input or observation data is a decentralized training objective.

Sequence Length

Compositional communication necessitates an adaptive limit on the total length of the sequence. Corollary 4.3. Repeat tokens, w, are redundant and can be removed. Suppose one predicts two arbitrary tokens, w k and w l . Given equation 1, it follows that there is low or near-zero mutual information between w k and w l .
A trivial issue is that the message generator will predict every available token as to follow the unique token objective. Since the tokens are imbued with input-oriented information (equation 2), the predicted tokens will be based on relevant referential details. Thus, it follows that tokens containing irrelevant information will not be chosen.
A nice optimization objective that follows from corollary 4.3 is that one can use self-supervised learning with an end-ofsequence (EOS) token to limit the variable total length of compositional message sequences.

Message Generation Architecture

Now, we can define the pipeline for message generation. The idea is to create an architecture that can generate features to enable independent message tokens. We expand each compressed token into the space of the hidden state h (1-layer linear expansion) since each token has a natural embedding in R |h| .
Then, we perform attention using a softmin to help minimize similarity with previous tokens and sample the new token from a variational distribution. See algorithm 1 for complete details. During execution, we can generate messages directly due to equation 1, resolving any computation time lost from sequential compositional message generation.

Utility through Contrastive Learning

First, note that our Markov Network is as follows: H j → M j → Y i ← H i . Continue to denote i as the agent identification and j as the agent ID such that j = i. We aim to satisfy the utility objective of the information bottleneck, I(M j ; Y i ), through contrastive learning as shown in figure 1. Proposition 5.1.
Utility mutual information is lower bounded by the contrastive NCE-binary objective, The proof is in Appendix A.1. This result shows a need for gradient information to flow backward across agents along communication edge connections.

Experiments and Results

We condition on inputs, especially rich information (such as pixel data), and task-specific information. When evaluating an artificial language in MARL, we are interested in referential tasks, in which communication is required to complete the task. With regard to intent-grounded communication, we study ordinal tasks, which require coordination information between agents to complete successfully.
Thus, we consider tasks with a team of agents to foster messaging that communicates coordination information that also includes their observations. To test H1, structuring emergent messages enables lower complexity, we test our methodology and analyze the input-oriented information and utility capabilities.
Next, we analyze the ability of heterogeneous agents to understand differing communication policies (H2)). Finally, we consider the effect of social shadowing (H3), in which agents solely learn a communication policy from an expert agent's action policy. We additionally analyze the role of offline reinforcement learning for emergent communication in combination with online reinforcement learning to further learn emergent communication alongside an action policy.
We evaluate each scenario over 10 seeds.

Environments

Blind Traffic Junction We consider a benchmark that requires both referential and ordinal capabilities within a team of agents. The blind traffic junction environment requires multiple agents to navigate a junction without any observation of other agents. Rather, they only observe their own state location.
Ten agents must coordinate to traverse through the lanes without colliding into agents within their lane or in the junction. Our training uses REINFORCE . Pascal VOC Game We further evaluate the complexity of compositional communication with a Pascal VOC . This is a two-agent referential game similar to the Cifar game but requires the prediction of multiple classes.
During each episode, each agent observes a random image from the Pascal VOC dataset containing exactly two unique labels. Each agent must encode information given only the raw pixels from the original image such that the other agent can recognize the two class labels in the original image. An agent receives a reward of 0.25 per correctly chosen class label and will receive a total reward of 1 if both agents guess all labels correctly.
See figure 2. Our training uses heterogeneous agents trained with PPO (modified from MAPPO repository). For simplicity of setup, we consider images with exactly two unique labels from a closed subset of size five labels of the original set of labels from the Pascal VOC data. Furthermore, these images must be of size 375 × 500 pixels.
Thus, the resultant dataset comprised 534 unique images from the Pascal VOC dataset.

Baselines

To evaluate our methodology, we compare our method to the following baselines: (1) no-comm, where agents do not communicate; (2) rl-comm, which uses a baseline communication method learned solely through policy loss ; (3) ae-comm, which uses an autoencoder to ground communication in input observations ; (4) VQ-VIB, which uses a variational autoencoder to ground discrete communication in input observations and a mutual information objective to ensure low entropy communication .
We provide an ablation of the loss parameter β in table 1 in the blind traffic junction scenario. When β = 0, we use our compositional message paradigm without our derived loss terms. We find that higher complexity and independence losses increase sample complexity. When β = 1, the model was unable to converge.
However, when there is no regularization loss, the model performs worse (with no guarantees about referential representation). We attribute this to the fact that our independence criteria learns a stronger causal relationship. There are fewer spurious features that may cause an agent to take an incorrect action.
In order to understand the effect of the independent concept representation, we analyze the emergent language's capacity for redundancy. A message token m l is redundant if there exists another token m k that represents the same information. With our methodology, the emergent 'language' converges to the exact number of observations and intents required to solve the task.
With a soft discrete threshold, the independent information loss naturally converges to a discrete number of tokens in the vocabulary. Our β ablation in table 1 yields a bijection between each token in the vocabulary and the possible emergent concepts, i.e., the enumerated observations and intents. Thus for β = 0.1, there is no redundancy.
Sparse Communication In corollary 4.3, we assume that there is no mutual information between tokens. In practice, the loss may only be near-zero. Our empirical results yield independence loss around 1e − 4. In table 1, the size of the messages is automatically compressed to the smallest size to represent the information.
Despite a trivially small amount of mutual information between tokens, our compositional method is able to reduce the message size in bits by 2.3x using our derived regularization, for a total of an 8x reduction in message size over non-compositional methods such as ae-comm. Since the base unit for the token is a 32-bit float, we note that each token in the message may be further compressed.
We observe that each token uses three significant digits, which may further compress tokens to 10 bits each for a total message length of 20 bits.

Communication Utility Results

Due to coordination in MARL, grounding communication in referential features is not enough. Finding the communication utility requires grounding messages in ordinal information. Overall, figure shows that our compositional, contrastive method outperforms all methods focused on solely input-oriented communication grounding.
In the blind traffic junction, our method yields a higher average task success rate and is able to achieve it with a lower sample complexity. Training with the contrastive update tends to spike to high success but not converge, often many episodes before convergence, which leaves area for training improvement.
That is, the contrastive update begins to find aligned latent spaces early in training, but it cannot adapt the methodology quickly enough to converge. The exploratory randomness of most of the early online data prevents exploitation of the high utility f + examples. This leaves further room for improvement for an adaptive contrastive loss term.
Regularization loss convergence After convergence to high task performance, the autoencoder loss increases in order to represent the coordination information. This follows directly from the information bottleneck, where there exists a tradeoff between utility and complexity. However, communication, especially referential communication, should have an overlap between utility and complexity.
Thus, we should seek to make the complexity loss more convex. Our compositional communication complexity loss does not converge before task performance convergence. While the complexity loss tends to spike in the exploratory phase, the normalized value is very small. Interestingly, the method eventually converges as the complexity loss converges below a normal- ized 0.3.
Additionally, the contrastive loss tends to decrease monotonically and converges after the task performance converges, showing a very smooth decrease. The contrastive f − loss decreases during training, which may account for success spikes prior to convergence. The method is able to converge after only a moderate decrease in the f + loss.
This implies empirical evidence that the contrastive loss is an optimal critic for messaging. See figure 3.

Heterogeneous Alignment Through Communication

In order to test the heterogeneous alignment ability of our methodology to learn higher-order concepts from highdimensional data, we analyze the performance on the Pascal VOC game. We compare our methodology against ae-comm to show that concepts should consist of independent information directly from task signal rather than compression to reconstruct inputs.
That is, we show an empirical result on pixel data to verify the premise of the information bottleneck. Our methodology significantly outperforms the observation-grounded ae-comm baseline, as demonstrated by figure 4. The ae-comm methodology, despite using autoencoders to learn observation-grounded communication, performs only slightly better than no-comm.
On the other hand, our methodology is able to outperform both baselines significantly. It is important to note that based on figure 4, our methodology is able to guess more than two of the four labels correctly across the two agents involved, while the baseline methodologies struggle to guess exactly two of thew four labels consistently.
This can be attributed to our framework being able to learn compositional concepts that are much more easily discriminated due to mutual independence.

Social Shadowing

Critics of emergent communication may point to the increased sample complexity due to the dual communication and action policy learning. In the social shadowing scenario, heterogeneous agents can learn to generate a communication policy without learning the action policy of the watched expert agents. To enable social shadowing, the agent will alternate between a batch of traditional MARL (no expert) and (1st-person) shadowing an expert agent performing the task in its trajectory.
The agent only uses the contrastive objective to update its communication policy during shadowing. In figure , the agent that performs social shadowing is able to learn the action policy with almost half the sample complexity required by the online reinforcement learning agent. Our results show that the structured latent space of the emergent communication learns socially benevolent coordination.
This tests our hypothesis that by learning communication to understand the actions of other agents, one can enable lower sample complexity coordination. Thus, it mitigates the issues of solely observing actions.

Discussion

By using our framework to better understand the intent of others, agents can learn to communicate to align policies and coordinate. Any referential-based setup can be performed with a supervised loss, as indicated by the instant satisfaction of referential objectives. Even in the Pascal VOC game, which appears to be a purely referential objective, our results show that intelligent compression is not the only objective of referential communication.
The emergent communication paradigm must enable an easy-to-discriminate space for the game. In multi-agent settings, the harder challenge is to enable coordination through communication. Using contrastive communication as an optimal critic aims to satisfy this, and has shown solid improvements. Since contrastive learning benefits from good examples, this method is even more powerful when there is access to examples from expert agents.
In this setting, the communication may be bootstrapped, since our optimal critic has examples with strong signals from the 'social shadowing' episodes. Additionally, we show that the minimization of our independence objective enables tokens that contain minimal overlapping information with other tokens.
Preventing trivial communication paradigms enables higher performance. Each of these objectives is complementary, so they are not trivially minimized during training, which is a substantial advantage over comparative baselines. Unlike prior work, this enables the benefits of training with reinforcement learning in multi-agent settings.
In addition to lower sample complexity, the mutual information regularization yields additional benefits, such as small messages, which enables the compression aspect of sparse communication. From a qualitative point of view, the independent information also yields discrete emergent concepts, which can be further made human-interpretable by a post-hoc analysis .
This is a step towards white-box machine learning in multi-agent settings. The interpretability of this learned white-box method could be useful in human-agent teaming as indicated by prior work . The work here will enable further results in decision-making from high-dimensional data with emergent concepts.
The social scenarios described are a step towards enabling a zero-shot communication policy. This work will serve as future inspiration for using emergent communication to enable ad-hoc teaming with both agents and humans.

Appendix

A.1. Proofs Proposition 4.1 For the interaction information between all tokens, the following upper bound holds: Proof. Starting with the independent information objective, we want to minimize the interaction information, which defines the conditional mutual information between each token and, Let π i m (m l |h) be a variational approximation of p(m l |h), which is defined by our message encoder network.
Given that each token should provide unique information, we assume independence between m l . Thus, it follows that our compositional message is a vector, m = [m 1 , . . . , m L ], and is jointly Gaussian. Moreover, we can define q( m|h) as a variational approximation to p(m|h) = p(m 1 ; . . . , m L |h).
We can model q with a network layer and define its loss as || m − m|| 2 . Thus, transforming equation 4 into variational form, we have, it follows that q( m|h) log q( m|h)d m ≥ q( m|h) log Thus, we can bound our interaction information, Proposition 4.2 For the mutual information between the composed message and encoded information, the following upper bound holds:
Proof. By definition of mutual information between the composed messages M and the encoded observations H, we have, Substituting q( m|h) for p( m|h), the same KL Divergence identity, and defining a Gaussian approximation z( m) of the marginal distribution p( m), it follows that, In expectation of equation 1, we have,
This implies that, for m = [m 1 , . . . , m L ], there is probabilistic independence between m j , m k , j = k. Thus, expanding, it follows that, where z(m l ) is a standard Gaussian. Proposition 5.1. Utility mutual information is lower bounded by the contrastive NCE-binary objective, Proof. We suppress the reliance on h since this is directly passed through.
By definition of mutual information, we have, Our network model learns π R + (y|m) from rolled-out trajectories, R + , using our policy. The prior of our network state, π R − (y), can be modeled from rolling out a random trajectory, R−. Unfortunately, it is intractable to model π R + (y|m) and π R − (y) directly during iterative learning, but we can sample y + ∼ π R + (y|m) and y − ∼ π R − (y) directly from our network during training.
It has been shown that log p(y|m) provides a bound on mutual information , with the expectation over l p(m l , y l ). However, we need a tractable understanding of the information Y . In the information bottleneck, Y represents the desired outcome. In our setup, y is coordination information that helps create the desired output, such as any action a − .
This implies, y =⇒ a − . Since the transition is known, it follows that a − =⇒ s − f , a random future state. Thus, we have, π This is similar to the proof for lemma A.5, but requires assumptions on messages m from the emergent language. We note that when m is random, the case defaults to lemma A.5. Thus, we assume we have at least input-oriented information in m given sufficiently satisfying equation 2. Given a sufficient emergent language, it follows that y =⇒ a + , where a + is an intention action based on m.
Similarly, since the transition is known, a + =⇒ s + f , a desired goal state along the trajectory. Thus, we have, π R + (y|m) = p(s = s + f |y, m). Recall the following (as shown in ), which we have adapted to our communication objective, Proposition A.3 (rewards → probabilities). The Q-function for the goal-conditioned reward function r g (s t , m t ) = (1 − γ)p(s = s g |y t ) is equivalent to the probability of state s g under the discounted state occupancy measure:
and Lemma A.4. The critic function that optimizes equation 8 is a Q-function for the goal-conditioned reward function up to a multiplicative constant 1 The critic function f (s, m, s f ) = y enc(s f ) represents the similarity between the encoding y = enc(s, m) and the encoding of the future rollout s f .
Given lemmas A.5 A.6 A.8 and proposition A.7, it follows that equation 8 is the NCE-binary (InfoMAX ) objective, Î(M j , Y i ) = log σ(f (s, m, s + f )) + log 1 − σ(f (s, m, s − f )) which lower bounds the mutual information, I(M j , Y i ) ≥ Î(M j , Y i ). The critic function is unbounded, so we constrain it to [0, 1] with the sigmoid function, σ( * ).
We suppress the reliance on h since this is directly passed through. By definition of mutual information, we have, Our network model learns π R + (y|m) from rolled-out trajectories, R + , using our policy. The prior of our network state, π R − (y), can be modeled from rolling out a random trajectory, R−.
Unfortunately, it is intractable to model π R + (y|m) and π R − (y) directly during iterative learning, but we can sample y + ∼ π R + (y|m) and y − ∼ π R − (y) directly from our network during training. It has been shown that log p(y|m) provides a bound on mutual information , with the expectation over l p(m l , y l ).
However, we need a tractable understanding of the information Y . Lemma A.5. π R − (y) = p(s = s − f |y). In the information bottleneck, Y represents the desired outcome. In our setup, y is coordination information that helps create the desired output, such as any action a − . This implies, y =⇒ a − . Since the transition is known, it follows that a − =⇒ s − f , a random future state.
Thus, we have, π R − (y) = p(s = s − f |y). Lemma A.6. π R + (y|m) = p(s = s + f |y, m). This is similar to the proof for lemma A.5, but requires assumptions on messages m from the emergent language. We note that when m is random, the case defaults to lemma A.5. Thus, we assume we have at least input-oriented information in m given sufficiently satisfying equation 2. Given a sufficient emergent language, it follows that y =⇒ a + , where a + is an intention action based on m.
Similarly, since the transition is known, a + =⇒ s + f , a desired goal state along the trajectory. Thus, we have, π R + (y|m) = p(s = s + f |y, m). Recall the following (as shown in ), which we have adapted to our communication objective, Proposition A.7 (rewards → probabilities). The Q-function for the goal-conditioned reward function r g (s t , m t ) = (1 − γ)p(s = s g |y t ) is equivalent to the probability of state s g under the discounted state occupancy measure:
and Lemma A.8. The critic function that optimizes equation 8 is a Q-function for the goal-conditioned reward function up to a multiplicative constant 1 p(s f ) : exp(f * (s, m, s f ) = 1 p(s f ) Q π s f (s, m). The critic function f (s, m, s f ) = y enc(s f ) represents the similarity between the encoding y = enc(s, m) and the encoding of the future rollout s f .
Given lemmas A.5 A.6 A.8 and proposition A.7, it follows that equation 8 is the NCE-binary (InfoMAX ) objective, which lower bounds the mutual information, I(M j , Y i ) ≥ Î(M j , Y i ). The critic function is unbounded, so we constrain it to [0, 1] with the sigmoid function, σ( * ).",['An unsupervised method based on the information bottleneck and contrastive learning.'],6235,multifieldqa_en,en,,120cb783c796fbedbc76f04cf9be3318e54a63cd642c4401," Paper: On the Role of Emergent Communication for Social Learning in Multi-Agent Reinforcement LearningPublish Date: Unkown.Author List: Seth Karten, Siva Kailas, Huao Li, Katia Sycara.Figure 1.

Blind Traffic Junction Social shadowed enables significantly higher sample complexity than traditional MARL when compared with ae-comm, no-comm and supervised pretraining. Figure 6. The effect of social shadowing on social learning agents. Agents learn to communicate effectively through a backpropagation signal from their task performance. This has been found useful for applications in human-agent teaming, multirobot navigation, and coordination in complex games such as StarCraft II. In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents suffer from partial observability and non-stationarity (due to unaligned value functions) This can be solved with decentralized learning through communication. In this work, we investigate the challenges of learning a messaging lexicon to prepare emergent communication for social learning (EC4SL) scenarios. We introduce a'social shadowing' learning approach where we use first-person observations, rather than third-person observation, to encourage the novice to learn latently or conceptually how to communicate and develop an understanding of intent for better coordination. We show that contrastive learning is an optimal critic for communication, reducing sample complexity for the unsupervisedEmergent communication objective. through social shadowing. The idea is to enable a shared emergent communication substrate (with minimal bandwidth) to enable future coordi-nation with novel partners. Our contributions are deriving an optimal critic for a communication policy and showing that the information bottleneck helps extend communication to social learning scenarios. Having structured emergent messages reduces sample complexity, and contrastive learning can help novice agents learn from experts. The properties of the tokens inEmergent communication directly affect their informative ability. As a baseline, continuous communication tokens can represent maximum information but lack human-interpretable properties. Discrete 1-hot (binary vector) tokens allow for a finite vocabulary, but each token contains the same magnitude of information, with equal orthogonal distance to each other token. The number of observed distinct communication tokens is far below the number permissible. Building on the continuous word embedding properties, VQ-VIB is an information-theoretic observation grounding based on  VQ. n VQ-VAE properties, uses Variational properties to provide word embedding properties for continuous emergent tokens. Each of these message types determines a single token for communication. Tokens are stringed together to create emergent ""sentences"" The on-policy reinforcement learning training uses RE-INFORCE or a decentralized version of MAPPO. The best observation encoding and action decoding architecture is task-dependent, i.e., using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), CNNs, GRUs, or transformer layers are best suited to different inputs. The message encoding substage can be defined as an information bottleneck problem, which defines a tradeoff between the complexity of information (compression) and the preserved relevant information (utility) We aim to satisfy the complexity objective, I(H i, M i ), through compositional communication. In our setup, the relevant information flows from other agents through communication, signaling a combination of the information bottleneck and a Lewis game. We assume that our observation and memory/sequence encoder provides an optimal representation H i suitable for sharing relevant observation and intent/coordination information. Each token has a fixed length in bits W. The total sequence is limited by a fixed limit, L l W l ≤ S, of S bits and a total of L tokens. The message generator will predict every available token as to follow the unique token objective.

We additionally analyze the role of offline reinforcement learning for emergent communication in combination with online reinforcement learning to further learn emergent communications alongside an action policy. We find that higher complexity and independence losses increase sample complexity. When there is no regularization loss, the model performs worse. There are fewer spurious features that may cause an agent to tak a different action than the one it is trained to take. We provide an ablation of the loss parameter β in table 1 in the blind Traffic Junction scenario. When β = 0, we use our compositional message paradigm without our derived loss terms. With our methodology, the emergent 'language' converges to the exact number of observations and intents required to solve the task. In table 1, the size of the messages is automatically compressed to the smallest size to represent the information. Despite a trivially small amount of mutual information between tokens, our compositional method is able to reduce the message size in bits by 2.3x using our derived regularization, for a total of an 8x reduction in message size over non-compositional methods such as ae-comm. Finding the communication utility requires grounding messages in ordinal information. The contrastive update begins to find aligned latent spaces early in training, but it cannot adapt the methodology quickly enough to converge. The exploratory randomness of most of the early online data prevents exploitation of the high utility f + examples. This leaves further room for improvement for an adaptive contrastive loss term.

This is similar to the proof for lemma a.5, but requires assumptions on messages m from the emergentlanguage."
How is the function beta(r) determined in the derivation?,"\section{Introduction}
The Schwarzschild solution plays a key role in teaching about general relativity: It describes the simplest version of a black hole. By Birkhoff's theorem, it more generally describes the gravitational field around any spherical mass distribution, such as the Sun in our own Solar system. As one of two particularly simple, yet physically relevant examples of a non-trivial metric (the other being the FLRW spacetime of an expanding universe), it is particularly well-suited for teaching about general techniques of ``reading'' and interpreting a spacetime metric.

Consider undergraduate courses where students are introduced to selected concepts and results from general relativity without exposing them to the full mathematical formalism. Such courses have the advantage of introducing students to one of the two great fundamental theories of 20th century physics early on (the other being quantum mechanics); they also profit from subject matter that meets with considerable interest from students.\cite{Hartle2006} Using the terminology of Christensen and Moore,\cite{Christensen2012} in the ``calculus only'' approach pioneered by Taylor and Wheeler,\cite{Taylor2001,Taylor2018} spacetime metrics are not derived, but taken as given, and the focus is on learning how to interpret a given spacetime metric. Similar presentations can be found in the first part of the ``physics first'' approach exemplified by Hartle's text book,\cite{Hartle2003} where the concepts of the metric and of geodesics are introduced early on, and their physical consequences explored, while the mathematics necessary for the Einstein equations is only introduced at a later stage. 

Whenever the approach involves an exploration of simple metrics such as the Schwarzschild solution, but stops short of the formalism required for the full tensorial form of Einstein's equations, access to a simple derivation of the Schwarzschild solution that does not make use of the advanced formalism can be a considerable advantage.

Simplified derivations of the Schwarzschild solution have a long tradition within general relativity education,\cite{Schiff1960,Harwit1973} although specific simplifications have met with criticism.\cite{Rindler1968} This article presents a derivation which requires no deeper knowledge of the formalism of differential geometry beyond an understanding of how to interpret a given spacetime metric $\mathrm{d} s^2$. The derivation avoids the criticism levelled at attempts to derive the Schwarzschild solution from the Einstein equivalence principle in combination with a Newtonian limit,\cite{Gruber1988} relying as it does on a simplified version of the vacuum Einstein equation.

More specifically, I combine the restrictions imposed by the symmetry with the simple form of Einstein's equations formulated by Baez and Bunn.\cite{BaezBunn2005} That same strategy was followed by Kassner in 2017,\cite{Kassner2017} but in this text, I use the ``infalling coordinates'' that are commonly associated with the Gullstrand-Painlev\'e form of the Schwarzschild metric,\cite{Martel2001,Visser2005,HamiltonLisle2008} not the more common Schwarzschild coordinates. That choice simplifies the argument even further. In the end, what is required is no more than the solution of an ordinary differential equation for a single function, which yields to standard methods, to obtain the desired result.

\section{Coordinates adapted to spherical symmetry and staticity}
\label{SymmetriesCoordinates}

Assume that the spacetime we are interested in is spherically symmetric and static. In general relativity, a symmetry amounts to the possibility of being able to choose coordinates that are adapted to the symmetry, at least within a restricted sub-region of the spacetime in question. That the spacetime is static is taken to mean that we can introduce a (non-unique) time coordinate ${t}$ so that our description of spacetime geometry does not depend explicitly on ${t}$, and that space and time are completely separate --- in the coordinates adapted to the symmetry, there are no ``mixed terms'' involving $\mathrm{d} {t}$ times the differential of a space coordinate in the metric. If we use ${t}$ to slice our spacetime into three-dimensional hyperplanes, each corresponding to ``space at time ${t}$,'' then each of those 3-spaces has the same spatial geometry. A mixed term would indicate that those slices of space would need to be shifted relative to another in order to identify corresponding points. The mixed term's absence indicates that in adapted coordinates, there is no need for such an extra shift. In those coordinates, we can talk about the 3-spaces as just ``space,'' without the need for specifying which of the slices we are referring to.

In the case of spherical symmetry, we can introduce spherical coordinates that are adapted to the symmetry: a radial coordinate $r$ and the usual angular coordinates $\vartheta,\varphi$, so that the spherical shell at constant $r$ has the total area $4\pi r^2$. In consequence, the part of our metric involving $\mathrm{d}\vartheta$ and $\mathrm{d}\varphi$ will have the standard form
\begin{equation}
r^2(\mathrm{d}\vartheta^2+\sin^2\theta\mathrm{d}\varphi^2) \equiv r^2\mathrm{d}\Omega^2,
\end{equation}
where the right-hand side defines $\mathrm{d}\Omega^2$, the infinitesimal solid angle corresponding to each particular combination of $\mathrm{d}\vartheta$ and $\mathrm{d}\varphi$.

The radial coordinate slices space into spherical shells, each corresponding to a particular value $r=const.$ The rotations around the origin, which are the symmetry transformations of spherical symmetry, map each of those spherical shells onto itself, and they leave all physical quantities that do not explicitly depend on $\vartheta$ or $\varphi$ invariant.

In what follows, we will use the basic structures introduced in this way --- the slices of simultaneous ${t}$, the radial directions within each slice, the angular coordinates spanning the symmetry--adapted spherical shells of area $4\pi r^2$ --- as auxiliary structures for introducing spacetime coordinates. For now, let us write down the shape that our metric has by simple virtue of the spherical symmetry, the requirement that the spacetime be static, and the adapted coordinates, namely
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2F(r) \mathrm{d} {t}^2 + G(r) \mathrm{d} r^2 + r^2\:\mathrm{d}\Omega^2. 
\label{StaticForm}
\end{equation}
Students familiar with  ``reading'' a spacetime metric will immediately recognize the sign difference between the parts describing space and describing time that is characteristic for spacetime, and the speed of light $c$ that gives us the correct physical dimensions. That there is no explicit dependence on $\varphi$ and $\vartheta$ in the remaining functions $F$ and $G$ is a direct consequence of spherical symmetry. That the factor in front of $\mathrm{d}\Omega^2$ is $r^2$ is a consequence of our coordinate choice, with spherical angular coordinates so that the area of a spherical surface of constant radius $r$ is $4\pi r^2$. That there is no explicit dependence on ${t}$ is one consequence of the spacetime being static; the absence of the mixed term $\mathrm{d} {t}\cdot \mathrm{d} r$ is another. We are left with two unknown functions $F(r)$ and $G(r)$. In the following, let us call ${t}$ and $r$ the {\em static coordinates}. 
 
Note that, since $G(r)$ is as yet undefined, we have not yet chosen a specific physical meaning for the length measurements associated with our $r$ coordinate. But because of the $\mathrm{d}\Omega^2$ part, it is clear that whatever choice we make, the locally orthogonal lengths $r\cdot\mathrm{d}\vartheta$ and $r\cdot\sin\vartheta\cdot\mathrm{d}\varphi$ will have the same physical interpretation as for the length measurement corresponding to $\mathrm{d} r$.

\section{Infalling observer coordinates}
\label{Sec:InfallingObservers}

Now that we know what the radial directions are, at each moment of time ${t}$, we follow Visser\cite{Visser2005} as well as Hamilton and Lisle\cite{HamiltonLisle2008} in defining a family of radially infalling observers.  Observers in that family are in free fall along the radial direction, starting out at rest at infinity: In mapping each observer's radial progression in terms of the static coordinate time ${t}$, we adjust initial conditions, specifically: the choice of initial speed at some fixed time ${t}$, in just the right way that the radial coordinate speed goes to zero for each observer in the same way as $r\to\infty.$

It is true that talking about ``infalling'' observers already reflects our expectation that our solution should describe the spacetime of a spherically symmetric mass.  As we know from the Newtonian limit, such a mass attracts test particles in its vicinity. It should be noted, though, that all our calculations would also be compatible with the limit of no mass being present. In that case, ``infalling'' would be a misnomer, as our family of observers would merely hover in empty space at unchanging positions in $r$. 

We can imagine infinitesimal local coordinate systems associated with our observers --- think of the observer mapping out space and time by defining three orthogonal axes, and by measuring time with a co-moving clock. We assume all such little coordinate systems to be non-rotating --- otherwise, we would break spherical symmetry, since rotation would locally pick out a plane of rotation that is distinguishable from the other planes. The radial direction is a natural choice for the first space axis of those little free-falling systems. The other directions, we take to point to observers falling side by side with our coordinate-defining observer --- and to remain pointed at a specific such other observer, once the choice of direction is made.

We assume our infalling observers' clocks to be synchronised at some fixed radius value $r$. By spherical symmetry, those clocks should then be synchronised at {\em all} values of $r$. Anything else would indicate direction-dependent differences for the infalling observers and their clocks, after all. Hence, at any given static time ${t}$, all the infalling observers who are at radius value $r$ show the same proper time $T$ on the ideal clocks travelling along with them. 

Once our definition is complete, our static, spherically symmetric spacetime is filled with infalling observers from that family: Whenever we consider an event $\cal E$, there will be an observer from that family passing by at that time, at that location. 

Now, consider the coordinate speed of those infalling observers. If we position ourselves at some constant radius value $r$ and watch the falling observers fly by, then we can express both their proper time rate and their coordinate speed in the $r$ direction in terms of $r$ and ${t}$. We can combine the two pieces of information to obtain the rate of change in radial position $r$ with proper time $T$ for those infalling observers. But since the initial conditions for those observers are the same, and since our spacetime is, by assumption, static, the resulting function can only depend on $r$, and not explicitly on ${t}$. Let us rescale that function with the speed of light to make it dimensionless, give it an overall minus sign to make it positive for infalling particles, and call it $\beta(r)$,
\begin{equation}
\beta(r)\equiv -\frac{1}{c}\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} T}(r).
\label{betaDefinition}
\end{equation}

Recall from section \ref{SymmetriesCoordinates} that we also still have the freedom to decide on the physical meaning of $r$. We make the choice of making $\mathrm{d} r$ the physical length measured by one of our infalling observers at the relevant location in spacetime, at constant time $T$. Via our angular coordinates, that implies that length measurements orthogonal to the radial direction, $r\cdot\mathrm{d}\vartheta$ and $r\cdot\sin\vartheta\:\mathrm{d}\varphi$ inherit the same physical interpretation.

As a next step, we transform our metric (\ref{StaticForm}) from the static form into the form appropriate for our coordinate choice $r$ and $T$. We do so by writing the static time coordinate as a function ${t}(T,r)$ in terms of infalling observer time and radius value. In consequence,
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d} {t} = \frac{\partial{t}}{\partial T}\cdot\mathrm{d} T+ \frac{\partial {t}}{\partial r}\cdot\mathrm{d} r,
\end{equation}
and our new metric now has the form
\begin{align}
 \mathrm{d} s^2 = {} & -c^2 F(r)\left(\frac{\partial t}{\partial T}\right)^2\mathrm{d} T^2 \nonumber \\[0.2em]
 & -2c^2F(r)\left(\frac{\partial t}{\partial T}\right)\left(\frac{\partial t}{\partial r}\right)\mathrm{d} T\:\mathrm{d} r \nonumber \\[0.2em]
 & +\left[G(r)-c^2F(r)\left(\frac{\partial t}{\partial r}\right)^2\right]\mathrm{d} r^2+r^2\:\mathrm{d}\Omega^2.
 \end{align}
At face value, this looks like we are moving the wrong way, away from simplification, since we now have more functions, and they depend on two variables instead of one.

But in fact, this new formulation paves the way for an even simpler form of the metric. Consider a specific event, which happens at given radius value $r$. In a small region around that event, we will introduce a new coordinate $\bar{r}$ to parametrize the radial direction. We want this coordinate to be co-moving with our infalling observers at $r$; each such observer then has a position $\bar{r}=const.$ that does not change over time. 

Key to our next step is that we {\em know} the metric for the local length and time measurements made by any one of our free-falling observers. By Einstein's equivalence principle, the metric is that of special relativity. Locally, namely whenever tidal effects can be neglected, spacetime geometry for any non-rotating observer in free fall is indistinguishable from Minkowski spacetime as described by a local inertial system.

Since we have chosen both the time coordinate $T$ and the physical meaning of the radial coordinate $r$ so as to conform with the measurements of the local infalling observer, the transformation between $\bar{r}$ and $r$ is particularly simple: It has the form of a Galilei transformation
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d}\bar{r}= \mathrm{d} r + \beta(r)c\:\mathrm{d} T.
\label{barRshift}
\end{equation}
In that way, as it should be by definition, radial coordinate differences at constant $T$ are the same in both systems, while for an observer at constant $\bar{r},$ with $\mathrm{d} \bar{r}=0$, the relation between $\mathrm{d} r$ and $\mathrm{d} T$ is consistent with the definition of the function $\beta(r)$ in (\ref{betaDefinition}).

Are you surprised that this is not a Lorentz transformation, as one might expect from special relativity? Don't be. We are not transforming from one local inertial coordinate system to another. The $T$ is already the time coordinate of the infalling observers, so both coordinate systems have the same definition of simultaneity, and time dilation plays no role in this particular transformation. Also, we have chosen $r$ intervals to correspond to length measurements of the infalling observers, so there is no Lorentz contraction, either. It is the consequence of these special choices that gives the relation (\ref{barRshift}) its simple form.

Last but not least, when we analyse specifically an infinitesimal neighbourhood of the point $r,\vartheta,\varphi$, let us make the choice that directly at our point of interest, we make $\bar{r}$ coincide with $r$. Since before, we had only fixed the differential $\mathrm{d} \bar{r}$, we do have the remaining freedom of choosing a constant offset for $\bar{r}$ that yields the desired result.

By Einstein's equivalence principle, the metric in terms of the locally co-moving coordinates $T,\bar{r},\vartheta,\varphi$ is the spherical-coordinate version of the Minkowski metric,
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2\mathrm{d} T^2 + \mathrm{d}\bar{r}^2 + \bar{r}^2\mathrm{d}\Omega.
\end{equation}
This version can, of course, be obtained by taking the more familiar Cartesian-coordinate version
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d} s^2=-c^2\mathrm{d} T^2 + \mathrm{d} X^2 + \mathrm{d} Y^2 + \mathrm{d} Z^2,
\label{CartesianMinkowski}
\end{equation}
applying the definition of Cartesian coordinates $X,Y,Z$ in terms of spherical coordinates $\bar{r},\vartheta,\varphi$
\begin{equation}
x= \bar{r}\:\sin\vartheta\:\cos\varphi, \;\;
y= \bar{r}\:\sin\vartheta\:\sin\varphi, \;\;
z= \bar{r}\:\cos\vartheta,
\end{equation}
to express $\mathrm{d} X, \mathrm{d} Y, \mathrm{d} Z$ in terms of $\mathrm{d} \bar{r}, \mathrm{d}\vartheta, \mathrm{d}\varphi$, and substitute the result into (\ref{CartesianMinkowski}).

By noting that we have chosen $\bar{r}$ so that, at the specific spacetime event where we are evaluating the metric, $\bar{r}=r$, while, for small radial coordinate shifts around that location, we have the relation (\ref{barRshift}), we can now write down the same metric in the coordinates $T, r, \vartheta,\varphi$, namely as
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2\left[
1-\beta(r)^2
\right] \mathrm{d} T^2+2c\beta(r)\mathrm{d} r\:\mathrm{d} T
+\mathrm{d} r^2+r^2\mathrm{d}\Omega^2.
\label{preMetric}
\end{equation}
Since we can repeat that local procedure at any event in our spacetime, this result is our general form of the metric, for all values of $r$. This, then is the promised simplification: By exploiting the symmetries of our solutions as well as the properties of infalling observers, we have reduced our metric to a simple form with no more than one unknown function of one variable, namely $\beta(r)$.

So far, what I have presented is no more than a long-form version of the initial steps of the derivation given by Visser in his heuristic derivation of the Schwarzschild metric.\cite{Visser2005} In the next section, we will deviate from Visser's derivation.

\section{$\beta(r)$ from tidal deformations}
\label{TidalSection}

In the previous section, we had exploited symmetries and Einstein's equivalence principle. In order to determine $\beta(r)$, we need to bring in additional information, namely the Einstein equations, which link the matter content with the geometry of spacetime. For our solution, we only aim to describe the spacetime metric outside whatever spherically-symmetric matter distribution resides in (or around) the center of our spherical symmetry. That amounts to applying the {\em vacuum Einstein equations}.

More specifically, we use a particularly simple and intuitive form of the vacuum Einstein equations, which can be found in a seminal article by Baez and Bunn:\cite{BaezBunn2005} Consider a locally flat free-fall system around a specific event $\cal E$, with a time coordinate $\tau$, local proper time, where the event we are studying corresponds to $\tau=0$. In that system, describe a small sphere of freely floating test particles, which we shall call a {\em test ball}. The particles need to be at rest relative to each other at $\tau=0$. Let the volume of the test ball be $V(\tau)$. Then the vacuum version of Einstein's equations states that
\begin{equation}
\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 V}{\mathrm{d}\tau^2}\right|_{\tau=0} = 0.
\label{EinsteinVacuum}
\end{equation}
In words: If there is no matter or energy inside, the volume of such a test ball remains constant in the first order (those were our initial conditions) and the second order (by eq.~[\ref{EinsteinVacuum}]). 

If you are familiar with Wheeler's brief summary of Einstein's equations, ``spacetime grips mass, telling it how to move'' and ``mass grips spacetime, telling it how to curve'',\cite{Wheeler1990} you will immediately recognise that this is a specific way for the structure of spacetime telling the test ball particles how to move. The calculation later in this section provides the second part: It will amount to using (\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) to determine the structure of spacetime, namely the still missing function $\beta(r)$, and that is the way for mass, in this case: for the absence of mass, to tell spacetime how to curve.

Note that equation (\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) also holds true in Newtonian gravity. So in a way, this version of Einstein's equation can be seen as a second-order extension of the usual Einstein equivalence principle: Ordinarily, the equivalence principle is a statement about physics in the absence of tidal forces. Equation (\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) adds to this that the lowest-order correction for tidal forces in a freely falling reference frame is that specified by Newtonian gravity. This makes sense, since by going into a free-fall frame, and restricting our attention to a small spacetime region, we have automatically created a weak-gravity situation. In such a situation, tidal corrections are approximately the same as those described by Newton. This argument can serve as a heuristic justification of (\ref{EinsteinVacuum}).

In 2017, Kassner made use of the Baez-Bunn form of Einstein's vacuum equation to derive the Schwarzschild solution, starting from what we have encountered as the static form of the metric (\ref{StaticForm}).\cite{Kassner2017} We follow the same general recipe, but using the infalling coordinates introduced in section \ref{Sec:InfallingObservers}, which makes our derivation even simpler.

Consider five test particles in a small region of space. Let the motion of each be the same as for the local representative from our coordinate-defining family of infalling observers. We take the central particle $C$ to be at radial coordinate value $r=R$ at the time of the snapshot shown in Fig.~\ref{TestParticlesOutside}. The other four are offset relative to the central particle: As described in the local inertial system that is co-moving with the central particle, one of the particles is shifted by $\Delta l$ upwards in the radial direction, another downward, while two of the particles are offset orthogonally by the same distance.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{01-free-fall-particles.pdf}
\caption{Five test particles in our spherically-symmetric spacetime}
\label{TestParticlesOutside}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The $\Delta l$ is meant to be infinitesimally small, so while Fig.~\ref{TestParticlesOutside} is of course showing a rather large $\Delta l$ so as to display the geometry of the situation more clearly, we will in the following only keep terms linear in $\Delta l$. 

Consider a generic particle, which moves as if it were part of our coordinate-defining family of infalling observers, and which at the time $T_0$ is at $r=r_0$. By a Taylor expansion, that particle's subsequent movement is given by
\begin{equation}
r(T) = r_0 + \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} T}(T_0) \cdot \Delta T +\frac12 \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 r}{\mathrm{d} T^2}(T_0) \cdot \Delta T^2
\label{TaylorREvo}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta T\equiv T-T_0$. We know from (\ref{betaDefinition}) that the derivative in the linear term can be expressed in terms of $\beta(r)$; by the same token,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 r}{\mathrm{d} T^2} = -c\frac{\mathrm{d}\beta}{\mathrm{d} T}=-c\beta' \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} T} = c^2\beta\cdot\beta',
\end{equation}
where the prime denotes differentiation of $\beta$ with respect to its argument. Since, in the following, the product of $\beta$ and its first derivative will occur quite often, let us introduce the abbreviation
\begin{equation}
B(r) \equiv \beta(r)\cdot\beta'(r).
\label{BigBDefinition}
\end{equation}
With these results, can rewrite the Taylor expansion (\ref{TaylorREvo}) as 
\begin{equation}
r(T) = r_0 -c\beta(r_0)\cdot\Delta T + \frac12 c^2B(r_0)\cdot\Delta T^2.
\label{RadialOrbitTime}
\end{equation}
In order to find $r_C(T)$ for our central particle, we simply insert $r_0=R$ into that expression. If, on the other hand, we want to write down the time evolution for particles $U$ and $D$, let us denote it by $r_{U,D}(T)$, we need to evaluate the expression (\ref{RadialOrbitTime}) at the initial location $r_0=R\pm\Delta l$. Since $\Delta l$ is small, we can make a Taylor expansion of $\beta(r)$ and its derivative around $r=R$, and neglect everything beyond the terms linear in $\Delta l$. The result is
\begin{multline}
r_{U,D}(T)=R \pm\Delta l-c\left[
\beta(R)\pm\beta'(R)\Delta l
\right]\Delta T \\[0.2em]
+\frac{c^2}{2}\big[
B(R)\pm B'(R)\Delta l
\big]\Delta T^2
\end{multline}
In consequence, the distance between the upper and lower particle, $d_{\parallel}(T)\equiv r_U(T)-r_D(T),$ changes over time as
\begin{equation}
d_{\parallel}(T) =  2\Delta l\left[
1-c\beta'(R)\Delta T+\frac12c^2 B'(R)\Delta T^2
\right].
\label{dParallel}
\end{equation}
Next, let us look at how the distance between the particles $L$ and $R$ changes over time. The initial radial coordinate value for each of the particles is
\begin{equation}
r(T_0) = \sqrt{R^2+\Delta l^2}=R\left[1+\frac12\left(\frac{\Delta l}{R}\right)^2\right]\approx R,
\end{equation}
that is, equal to $R,$ as long as we neglect any terms that are higher than linear in $\Delta l$. In consequence, $r_{L,R}(t)$ is the same function as for our central particle, given by eq.~(\ref{RadialOrbitTime}) with $r_0=R$. The transversal (in Fig.~\ref{TestParticlesOutside}: horizontal) distance $d_{\perp}(T)$ between the particles $L$ and $R$ changes in proportion to the radius value,
\begin{align}
d_{\perp}(T) &= 2\Delta l\cdot\frac{r_{L}(T)}{R} \nonumber \\
                 &=2\Delta \left[1-\frac{c\beta(R)}{R}\Delta T+\frac{c^2}{2}\frac{B(R)}{R}\Delta T^2\right].
                \label{dPerp}
\end{align}
With these preparations, consider the vacuum Einstein equation (\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) for the volume of a test ball. Initially, our particles $C, U, D, L, R$ define a circle, which is deformed to an ellipse. By demanding rotational symmetry around the radial direction, we can construct the associated ellipsoid, which is initially a spherical surface. That ellipsoid has one axis in radial direction, whose length is $d_{\parallel}(T)$, and two axes that are transversal and each have the length  $d_{\perp}(t)$. But that ellipsoid is not quite yet the test ball we need. After all, the particles of the test ball need to be at rest initially, at time $T_0$, in the co-moving system defined by the central particle $C$. Our defining particles are not, as the terms linear in $\Delta T$ in both (\ref{dParallel}) and (\ref{dPerp}) show, where the coefficients of $\Delta T$ correspond to the particles' initial velocities. 

In order to define our test ball, we need to consider particles at the same location, undergoing the same acceleration, but which are initially at rest relative to the central particle $C$. 

We could go back to the drawing board, back to Fig.~\ref{TestParticlesOutside}, make a more general Ansatz that includes initial velocities which measure the divergence of the motion of our test ball particles from that of the infalling-observer particles, and repeat our calculation while including those additional velocity terms. But there is a short-cut. The only consequence of those additional velocity terms will be to change the terms linear in $\Delta T$ in equations (\ref{dParallel}) and (\ref{dPerp}). And we already know the end result: We will choose the additional terms so as to cancel the terms linear in $\Delta T$ in the current versions of (\ref{dParallel}) and (\ref{dPerp}). But by that reasoning, we can skip the explicit steps in between, and write down the final result right away. The time evolution of the radial-direction diameter of our test ball, let us call it $L_{\parallel}(T)$, must be the same as $d_{\parallel}(T)$, but without the term linear in $\Delta T$. Likewise, the time evolution $L_{\perp}(T)$ of the two transversal diameters must be equal to $d_{\perp}(T)$, but again without the term linear in $\Delta T$. The result is
\begin{align}
L_{\parallel}(T)  &=  2\Delta l \left[1+\frac12c^2B'(R)\Delta T^2\right] \\
L_{\perp}(T) &= 2\Delta l \left[1+\frac{c^2}{2}\frac{B(R)}{R}\Delta T^2\right].
\end{align}
Thus, our test ball volume is
\begin{align}
V(T) &= \frac{\pi}{6}L_{\parallel}(T) L_{\perp}^2(T) \\
       &= \left.\frac{4\pi}{3}\Delta l^3\left[1+{c^2}\left( \frac{B(r)}{r} + \frac{B'(r)}{2}\right)\Delta T^2\right]\right|_{r=R}
\end{align}
For the second time derivative of $V(T)$ to vanish at the time $T=T_0$, we must have
\begin{equation}
\frac{B(r)}{r} + \frac{B'(r)}{2}= 0
\label{VolumeConditionR}
\end{equation}
for all values of $r$. This is readily solved by the standard method of separation of variables: We can rewrite (\ref{VolumeConditionR}) as
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d} B}{B} = -2\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{r},
\end{equation}
which is readily integrated to give
\begin{equation}
\ln(B) = -\ln(r^{2}) + const.  \;\; \Rightarrow \;\; \ln(Br^2) = C',
\end{equation}
with a constant $C'$, which upon taking the exponential gives us
\begin{equation}
Br^2= C,
\label{BSolution}
\end{equation}
with a constant $C$. Note that the constant $C$ can be negative --- there is no reason the constant $C'$ needs to be real; only our eventual function $B(r)$ needs to be that, and it is clear that (\ref{BSolution}) satisfies the differential equation
(\ref{VolumeConditionR}) for any constant $C$, positive, zero, or negative. By (\ref{BigBDefinition}), the solution (\ref{BSolution}) corresponds to the differential equation
\begin{equation}
\beta(r)\beta'(r) = \frac{C}{r^2}
\end{equation}
for our function $\beta$; with another separation of variables, we can re-write this as 
\begin{equation}
\beta\cdot\mathrm{d}\beta=C\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{r^2}.
\end{equation}
Both sides are readily integrated up; we can solve the result for $\beta(r)$ and obtain
\begin{equation}
\beta(r) = \sqrt{
-\frac{2C}{r} +2D
},
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the second integration constant, and where we have chosen the proper sign, since we know that $\beta(r)>0$. That brings us to the last step: The requirement that, for large values of $r$, the description provided by our solution should correspond to the results from Newtonian gravity. First of all, we note that our initial condition for the infalling observers, which had those observers start out at zero speed at infinity, means that we must choose $D=0$. Then, as we would expect, $\beta(r)$ for large values of $r$ becomes very small, corresponding to small speeds. But at slow speeds, time and length intervals as measured by the infalling observer will become arbitrarily close to time and length intervals as measured by an observer at rest in our static coordinate system at constant $r$, using the static time coordinate ${t}$. As is usual, we identify these coordinates with those of an approximately Newtonian description. In that description, the radial velocity is
\begin{equation}
v(r) = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}},
\end{equation}
which follows directly from energy conservation for the sum of each observer's kinetic and Newtonian-gravitational potential energy. This fixes the remaining integration constant as
\begin{equation}
C = -\frac{GM}{c^2},
\end{equation}
and the final form of our function $\beta(r)$ becomes
\begin{equation}
\beta(r) = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{rc^2}}.
\end{equation}
Inserting this result in (\ref{preMetric}), we obtain the metric
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2\left[
1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}
\right]\mathrm{d} T^2+2\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}\mathrm{d} r\:\mathrm{d} T+\mathrm{d} r^2+r^2\mathrm{d}\Omega^2.
\label{GPMetric}
\end{equation}
This is known as the Gullstrand-Painlev\'e version of the Schwarzschild metric.\cite{Martel2001,Visser2005,HamiltonLisle2008} A  last transformation step brings us back to the traditional Schwarzschild form. Recall our discussion in sec.~\ref{SymmetriesCoordinates}, leading up to the explicitly static form (\ref{StaticForm}) of the metric? The main difference between our current form and the static version is the mixed term containing $\mathrm{d} r\:\mathrm{d} T$ in (\ref{GPMetric}). Everything else already has the required shape. Inserting the Ansatz
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d} T = \mathrm{d} t + \xi(r) \mathrm{d} r
\end{equation}
into the metric (\ref{GPMetric}), it is straightforward to see that the mixed term vanishes iff our transformation is
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d} T = \mathrm{d} t +\frac{\sqrt{2GM/r}}{c^2\left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)}\mathrm{d} r.
\label{TtTrafo}
\end{equation}
Substitute this into (\ref{GPMetric}), and the result is the familiar form of the Schwarzschild metric in Schwarzschild's original coordinates $t,r,\vartheta,\varphi$, 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d} s^2 = -c^2\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^2 r}
\right)\mathrm{d} t^2 + \frac{\mathrm{d} r^2}{\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^2 r}
\right)} + r^2\mathrm{d}\Omega^2.
\end{equation}

\section{Conclusion}
Using coordinates adapted to the symmetries, we were able to write down the spherically symmetric, static spacetime metric. On this basis, and using the family of infalling observers that is characteristic for the Gullstrand-Painlev\'e solution, we wrote down the metric in the form (\ref{preMetric}), with a single unknown function $\beta(r)$. From the simplified form (\ref{EinsteinVacuum}) of the vacuum Einstein equations, as applied to a test ball in free fall alongside one of our family of observers, we were able to determine $\beta(r)$, up to two integration constants. By using the Einstein equation, we escape the restrictions imposed on simplified derivations by Gruber et al.\cite{Gruber1988} 

From the initial condition for our infalling observers, as well as from the Newtonian limit at large distances from our center of symmetry, we were able to fix the values of the two intergration constants. Our derivation does not require knowledge of advanced mathematical concepts beyond the ability to properly interpret a given metric line element $\mathrm{d} s^2$. Even our analysis of tidal effects proceeds via a simple second-order Taylor expansion, leading to differential equations for $\beta(r)$ that are readily solved using two applications of the method of separation of variables. 

What is new about the derivation presented here is the combination of the Baez-Bunn equations with the infalling coordinates typical for the Gullstrand-Painlev\'e form of the metric --- this combination is what, in the end, makes our derivation particularly simple. In turn, this simplicity is what should make the derivation particularly useful in the context of teaching general relativity in an undergraduate setting.

The derivation proceeds close to the physics, and gives ample opportunity to discuss interesting properties of Einstein's theory of gravity. Students who are presented with this derivation, either as a demonstration or as a (guided) exercise, will come to understand the way that symmetries determine the form of a metric, the deductions that can be made from Einstein's equivalence principle, and last but not least that we need to go beyond the equivalence principle, and consider tidal forces, to completely define our solution.

It describes the simplest version of a black hole. By Birkhoff's theorem, it more generally describes the gravitational field around any spherical mass distribution, such as the Sun in our own Solar system. It is one of two particularly simple, yet physically relevant examples of a non-trivial metric. This article presents a derivation which requires no deeper knowledge of the formalism of differential geometry beyond an understanding of how to interpret a given spacetime metric. The derivation avoids the criticism levelled at attempts to derive the Schwarzschild solution from the Einstein equivalence principle in combination with a Newtonian limit. It relies as it does on a simplified version of the vacuum Einstein equation. In the end, what is required is no more than the solution of an ordinary differential equation for a single function, which yields to standard methods, to obtain the desired result. In this text, we assume that the spacetime we are interested in is spherically symmetric and static. In general relativity, a symmetry amounts to the possibility of being able to choose coordinates that are adapted to the symmetry, at least within a restricted sub-region of spacetime in question. In the case of spherical symmetry, we can introduce spherical coordinates that are adapted to the symmetry. We are left with two unknown functions $F(r) and $G(r), which we call the static and static coordinates. In those coordinates, there is no need for specifying which of the 3-spaces we are referring to. In consequence, the part of our metric involving $\mathrm{d}\vartheta$ and $varphi$ will have the standard form of $R(R) + G(G(R), since we have not yet chosen a specific coordinate for the measurements associated with our specific measurements. But it is clear that whatever choice we make, the locallyogonal lengths of the lengths $r, $cdot, and $rcdot$ will be the same for the corresponding measurement to the corresponding length of the coordinate in the metric. We will use the basic structures introduced in this way --- the slices of simultaneous ${t}$, the radial directions within each slice, the angular coordinates spanning the symmetry--adapted spherical shells of area $4\pi r^2$ --- as auxiliary structures for introducing spacetime coordinates. For now, let us write down the shape that our metric has by simple virtue of the spherical symmetry and the requirement that the spacetime be static. t of time ${t}$, we follow Visser and Hamilton in defining a family of radially infalling observers. Observers in that family are in free fall along the radial direction, starting out at rest at infinity. In mapping each observer's radial progression in terms of the static coordinate time $t$ we adjust initial conditions, specifically: the choice of initial speed at some fixed time. We assume all such little coordinate systems to be non-rotating, otherwise, we would break spherical symmetry. The radial direction is a natural choice for the first space axis of those little free-falling systems. The other directions, we take to point to observers falling side by side with our coordinate-defining observer, and to remain pointed at a specific such other observer, once the choice is made. All the infalling. observers who are at radius value $r$ show the same proper time $T$ on the ideal clocks travelling along with them. We can combine the two pieces of information to obtain the rate of change in radial position $ r$ with proper time £t$ for those infallingObservers. The resulting function can only depend on $r$, and not explicitly on £t. physical interpretation. We write the static time coordinate as a function ${t}(T,r)$ in terms of infalling observer time and radius value. By Einstein's equivalence principle, the metric is that of special relativity. Locally, whenever tidal effects can be neglected, spacetime geometry for any non-rotating observer in free fall is indistinguishable from Minkowski spacetime. We are not transforming from one local inertial coordinate system to another. The $T$ is already the time coordinate of the infalling observers, so both systems have the same definition of simultaneity, and time dilation plays no role in this particular transformation. There is no Lorentz contraction, so there is no special choices that give these special choices. We do have the remaining freedom of choosing the offset of a constant for our point of interest, but we do not have to choose the offset for our infinitesimal neighbourhood of the point $r, let us make the choice directly at our point $varta, instead of choosing an offset of freedom for the infinimal neighbourhood. We have chosen intervals to correspond to infalling intervals. We can now write the metric for the local length and time measurements made by any one of our free-falling observers. In the previous section, we had exploited symmetries and Einstein's equivalence principle. In order to determine the metric, we need to bring in additional information, namely the Einstein equations, which link the matter content with the geometry of spacetime. For our solution, we only aim to describe the spacetime metric outside whatever spherically-symmetric matter distribution resides in (or around) the center of our spherical symmetry. That amounts to applying the vacuum Einstein equations. In that system, we describe a small sphere of freely floating test particles, which we shall call a ball. The test particles need to be at the rest of the volume of the ball. If there is no matter or energy inside the volume, such as in a vacuum, then the test particle is not a particle. We can now write down the same metric in the coordinates $T, r, \vartheta,\varphi$ in terms of the CartesianMinkowski coordinates. We have reduced our metric to a simple form with no more than one unknown function of one variable, namely $r$ and we can repeat that local procedure at any event in our spacetime, this result is our general form of the metric. In the next section we will deviate from Visser's derivation of the Schwarzschild metric. In 2017, Kassner made use of the Baez-Bunn form of Einstein's vacuum equation to derive the Schwarzschild solution. By going into a free-fall frame, and restricting our attention to a small spacetime region, we have automatically created a weak-gravity situation. In such a situation, tidal corrections are approximately the same as those described by Newton. This argument can serve as a heuristic justification of (\ref{EinsteinVacuum}). In the following, we will in the following only keep terms linear in $\Delta l$ so as to display the geometry of the situation more clearly. We take the central particle $C$ to be at radial coordinate value $r=R$ at the time of the snapshot shown in Fig. 1. We follow the same general recipe, but using the infalling coordinates introduced in section \ref{Sec:InfallingObservers}, which makes our derivation even simpler. With these results, we can rewrite the Taylor expansion (TaylorREvo) as (T-T_0) with the product of its derivative and the prime product of the derivative of its first and first derivative. The result is a weak gravitational field of the form T-T-L (T, T, L). In order to define our test ball, we need to consider particles $C, U, D, L, R$ which are initially at the same location, but are undergoing the same acceleration. The distance between the upper and lower particle, $d_{\parallel}(T),$ changes over time as $r_0=R. We could go back to the drawing board and repeat our calculation while including those additional velocity terms. But there is a short-cut: The terms in the equations will be only to the linear terms in $\Delta T$ in order to make a more general general equation that includes the initial velocities of the test ball. The equations are shown in Fig. 1, which includes a general equation to measure the divergence of the motion of our test particles from that of the central particle $C$. The equations for the ball can be found at: http://www.einsteinvacuum.org/article/Einstein-Vacuum-Einstein.html#v=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,33-34,34-35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,64-64,67,68,69 For the second time derivative of $V(T)$ to vanish at the time $T=T_0$, we must have $B(r)$ for all values of $r$. This is readily solved by the standard method of separation of variables. The description provided by our solution should correspond to the results from Newtonian gravity. We can solve the result for $r$ and obtain the radial velocity of the test ball. In the next section, we will look at how this radial velocity is related to the potential energy of the ball. We will also look at the effect of gravity on the ball, and how this affects the ball's volume. We'll conclude by looking at how the ball behaves in the presence of a large gravitational field, such as a strong magnetic field or a strong gravitational field of up to 1,000,000 times the density of the Earth's atmosphere. The test ball will have a radius of 2,000 by 1,500 by 2,500, and a center of mass of 1,200 by 1.5,000. The ball will be at rest in our static coordinate system at the static time time of $t$ or $r$, and its velocity will be approximately approximately approximately 1/2 the speed of light. Using coordinates adapted to the symmetries, we were able to write down the spherically symmetric, static spacetime metric. By using the Einstein equation, we escape the restrictions imposed on simplified derivations by Gruber et al. Our derivation does not require knowledge of advanced mathematical concepts beyond the ability to properly interpret a given metric line element. Even our analysis of tidal effects proceeds via a simple second-order Taylor expansion, leading to differential equations for $\beta(r)$ that are readily solved using two applications of the method of separation of variables. In turn, this simplicity is what should make the derivation particularly useful in the context of teaching general relativity in an undergraduate setting. The derivation proceeds close to the physics, and gives ample opportunity to discuss interesting properties of Einstein's theory of gravity. It is hoped that this article will help students to understand the way that symmetry determine the form of a metric, the deductions that can be made from Einstein's equivalence principle, and last but not least that we need to consider tidal forces."

The three are operated by ConocoPhillips on behalf of the Ekofisk licensees. The area also embraces former producers Albuskjell, Cod, Edda, Tor, West Ekofisk and Tommeliten G.
These fields all lie within production licence 018 apart from Tommeliten G, which was operated by Statoil from 1976 to 2003.
In all, 31 installations have been positioned in the Greater Ekofisk Area.
First Norwegian offshore field
Ekofisk began production on 15 June 1971, following its discovery in the autumn of 1969. Development of the field has occurred in several phases.
Its central facilities were installed during the early 1970s, with oil initially being buoy-loaded into tankers. From 1975, it has been piped to Teesside in the UK. The gas has been landed by pipeline at Emden in Germany from 1977.
ekofisk i et nøtteskall, engelsk
Jacked up six metres
The water depth in the Greater Ekofisk Area is 70-75 metres. However, declining pressure in the Ekofisk reservoir over the years has caused the seabed to subside.
Efforts began as early as 1985 to safeguard the installations against the effects of this development, and the steel platforms in the Ekofisk Complex were jacked up by six metres in 1987.
In addition, a protective breakwater was installed around the Ekofisk tank in 1989. The rate of seabed subsidence has declined sharply in recent years.
Waterflooding improves recovery
The Ekofisk 2/4 K water injection platform became operational in December 1987 as part of efforts to improve Ekofisk’s recovery factor – the share of petroleum in place actually produced.
Waterflooding capacity on the field to help maintain reservoir pressure was later expanded several times, and had reached just over 500 000 barrels per day by 2019.
Measured in barrels of oil equivalent, the recovery factor on Ekofisk has risen from an original estimate of 17 per cent to over 50 per cent.
Ekofisk I and II plus licence extension
The first phase of development and production on Ekofisk began with initial oil output from the converted Gulftide jack-up rig in 1971 and ended with the start-up of Ekofisk II in 1998.
Large parts of the Greater Ekofisk Area were restructured in the latter year, leading to plans for removing 15 installations – 14 steel platforms and the process facilities on the Ekofisk tank.

Designated Ekofisk I, these redundant structures include Ekofisk 2/4 A, 2/4 B, 2/4 FTP, 2/4 Q, 2/4 H, 2/4 R, 2/4 P and 2/4 T.
In addition come the Edda 2/7 C, Albuskjell 1/6 A, Albuskjell 2/4 F, Cod 7/11 A, West Ekofisk 2/4 D, Norpipe 36/22 A and Norpipe 37/4 A installations.
The concrete part of the tank – Ekofisk 2/4 T – will remain. Gulftide was removed as far back as 1974. Two platforms owned by other companies – Ekofisk 2/4 G and 2/4 S – have also gone.
A new plan for development and operation (PDO) of the field (Ekofisk II) was approved in 1994, at the same time as the Ekofisk licence was extended to 2028.
This creates a new Ekofisk Complex with two structures – the Ekofisk 2/4 X wellhead unit installed in the autumn of 1996 and the Ekofisk 2/4 J processing and transport platform in 1997.
Ekofisk II became operational in August 1998 and is intended to produce until 2028. Ekofisk, Eldfisk and Embla are tied back to the new complex, as was Tor until it shut down in December 2015.

In December 2002, soon after the Conoco-Phillips merger had been announced, the Ekofisk West project was presented to improve oil and gas recovery. Process capacity and reliability on Ekofisk were also to be enhanced.
This development primarily involved the construction and installation of a new platform, Ekofisk 2/4 M, with processing facilities and 24 new wells drilled over five years.
The latter could contribute to improved recovery both because there were more wells and because they would tap new locations in the reservoir. On stream in 2005, 2/4 M was linked to the Ekofisk Complex with a bridge.
Process capacity for produced water was also to be increased through upgrading on Ekofisk 2/4 J and Eldfisk 2/7 E. A third measure concerned laying a power cable from the Ekofisk Complex to 2/4 K in order to make electricity supplies more efficient.
New developments: Eldfisk II and Ekofisk South

The plan for development and operation (PDO) of Eldfisk II, approved by the Storting (parliament) on 9 June 2011, includes a new wellhead, process and accommodation platform – Eldfisk 2/7 S.
In addition come 42 new wells as well as upgrades to existing platforms which extend their commercial life.
The PDO for Ekofisk South involves the construction of a new wellhead platform – Ekofisk 2/4 Z – as well as a new subsea water injection facility and 44 additional wells.

Oil terminal in Teesside

Teesside terminal. Brian Henderson Thynne takes samples of refrigerated propane. Photo: Husmo Foto/Norwegian Petroleum Museum
The terminal at Teesside in north-east England receives oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) by pipeline from the Ekofisk field. It comprises stabilisation, NGL fractionation, storage tanks for crude oil and an export port.
After arriving through the Norpipe Oil line, crude and NGL are separated and the oil goes through a stabilisation process before reaching the 10 storage tanks, which each hold 750 000 barrels.
The NGLs go to the fractionation facility, with a daily capacity of 64 000 barrels, for separation into methane, ethane, propane, and normal and iso butane.
While the methane (natural gas) is used to fuel the plant, the other products (now known as liquefied petroleum gases – LPG) are made liquid by cooling and stored for export by sea.
One reason for the choice of Teesside as the landfall for the Ekofisk pipeline was the opportunity it offered to install deepwater quays.
The terminal has four of these, with those for crude oil able to handle tankers up to 150 000 deadweight tonnes. The LPG quays can accept carriers loading as much as 60 000 cubic metres.
Two of the crude oil quays lie on the main channel of the River Tees, while the others have been installed in dredged docks.
Gas terminal in Emden
Gas arriving at the Emden terminal from the Ekofisk Complex enters nine parallel treatment trains for cleaning, metering and onward distribution to the buyers.
The North Sea gas is very clean, and needs only limited treatment to remove small amounts of sulphur compounds using an absorption process. Impure molecules from the gas accumulate on the surface of small particles, which act as filter spheres.
Each of the nine trains comprises four process columns and a process oven. The gas enters the top of a column and leaves through the base after passing through the filter spheres.
That leaves the gas ready for sale, and it is piped to the fiscal metering station before entering the buyer receiving pipelines and distribution network.
Three separate commercial pipeline systems connect to the terminal, operated by Ruhrgas, BEB and Gastransport Services (previously Gasunie) respectively. They pipe the gas away on behalf of the gas buyers.
The Norsea Gas Terminal in Emden was officially opened in September 1977 by Norwegian industry minister Bjartmar Gjerde and Phillips executive Gordon Goerin.
Ranking as the first gas sales deal for the Norwegian continental shelf, the Ekofisk agreement paved the way for later contracts covering other fields off Norway.
Regularity at the Emden terminal has been very high, with its own equipment never causing shutdowns. Maintenance takes place when other parts of the system are off line.
The terminal has a daily capacity of about 2.1 million cubic feet of gas per day.
Gas transport restructured
Norpipe AS owned the gas pipeline from Ekofisk to Emden until the transport system for the Norwegian offshore sector was restructured at 1 January 2003.
Norsea Gas A/S furthermore served as the formal owner of the Emden facility, with Phillips Petroleum and then ConocoPhillips as operator for both pipeline and terminal.

Since 2007, Norway’s state-owned Gassco company has been responsible for technical operation of the facilities on behalf of their owners.
That included operator responsibility for the H7 and B11 booster platforms along the gas pipeline, which were shut down in 2007 and 2013 respectively and have since been removed.
The Gassled partnership is a project collaboration embracing 10 companies which collective own large parts of the gas infrastructure on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS).
A substantial proportion of Norway’s gas deliveries to Germany continues to arrive at the Emden terminal, including the volumes piped from Ekofisk.
Preliminary planning for a new terminal in the German port began in 2011, with Gassled taking the investment decision for this development in the autumn of 2012.
Construction work began in the following year, with the new facility being built on an unused part of the existing terminal site.
The new terminal has not expanded export capacity. But its functionality is well adapted to future processing needs for fields in the Greater Ekofisk Area and other parts of the NCS sending gas through the Norpipe system.
It was officially opened on 24 May 2016 by Elisabeth Aspaker, the Norwegian government minister for the EU and the European Economic Area. That closed a chapter in Ekofisk’s history.

In addition to ConocoPhillips’ own production from Ekofisk, these pipelines carry gas and oil from the company’s fields in the UK sector and from other fields on the Norwegian and British continental shelves.
The three fields in the Greater Ekofisk Area are also tied together by pipelines.
Oil pipeline to Teesside

The pipeline linking Ekofisk with the terminal for oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) at Teesside on the north-east English coast became operational in October 1975.
Pumps raise the pressure of the oil and NGL before they start their journey to land. Two pumping stations – 37/4 A and 36/22 A ­– originally stood along the pipeline to maintain this pressure, but have now been disconnected and removed.
The pipeline was installed with the ability to carry a million barrels per day. However, that much capacity has never been required.
In the UK sector, a 24-inch pipeline has been tied in with a Y connection to receive input from several British fields – including the J block developments operated by ConocoPhillips.
Output from the Greater Ekofisk Area is supplemented by crude from Valhall, Hod, Ula and Gyda heading for Teesside, optimising pipeline utilisation and thereby boosting value creation.
The pipeline is owned by Norpipe Oil AS and operated by ConocoPhillips.
Gas pipeline to Emden

This pipeline became operational in September 1977. The starting pressure of around 132 bar is provided by compressors on the Ekofisk Complex.
The 443-kilometre distance to Emden was split into three equal sections, with platforms B11 and H7 located at the intermediate points to provide boosting if required.
However, additional compression was seldom needed on the final stage to Emden. H7 was shut down in 2007 and B11 in 2013, and both have since been removed.
These two booster platforms were located in the German sector of the North Sea, while the pipeline also crosses the Danish sector.
The pipeline has been trenched or covered with sand. Its final section passes the island of Juist before making landfall on the coast of East Friesland to the north of Emden.
Its daily capacity is roughly 59.4 million standard cubic metres (2.1 billion cubic feet). In addition to gas from the Greater Ekofisk Area, it carries output from Valhall, Hod, Ula, Gyda and the Statpipe system (primarily Statfjord and Gullfaks).

The Phillips group was awarded block 2/7 as early as 1965, and the Embla reservoir lies in the southern part of this acreage. Drilling began there in 1974 to depths of 4 500-5 000 metres, but pressure and temperature in the wells were too high for testing with the available equipment.
The first production well was not drilled and tested until 1988, followed by a second in 1990. Both yielded very promising results, and the field came on stream in May 1993.
Embla comprises a sandstone reservoir at least 250 million years old. The other fields in the Greater Ekofisk Area comprise fine-grained carbonate rocks deposited about 70 million years ago.
The Embla reservoir has a temperature of 160°C compared with the 125°C normally found in the chalk formations 1 000 metres higher up, and its pressure is almost twice as high.
Fabricated by Heerema in the Netherlands, the Embla 2/7 D jacket (support structure) was installed by the M 7000 crane vessel. It stands 84 metres high and weighs 2 300 tonnes.
A 5.2-kilometre subsea umbilical from Eldfisk comprises three power cables for electricity supply and eight fibreoptic lines handling data transmission and telecommunication.

The platform has six production wells and an average daily output of roughly 7 000 barrels of oil. All processing and metering took place on Eldfisk 2/7 FTP until 2015, and has now been switched to Eldfisk 2/7 S.
A 14-inch flowline linked 2/7 D with 2/7 FTP and runs today to 2/7 S. Produced at Wick in Scotland, this line was floated out to the field in one piece.
Topside equipment includes the wellhead area, helideck (built by Vindholmen Services in Arendal), crane, control room, workshop, test separator and glycol pump.
Normally unmanned, the platform is maintained as and when required and therefore incorporates a simplified accommodation module with lounge, mess, coffee room, galley, changing room, WC and 12 emergency beds.

Gulftide was converted to cope with conditions on Ekofisk in the Åmøy Fjord near Stavanger. This jack-up drilling rig was equipped with process equipment and its derrick, helideck, hangar and legs were reinforced.
To win time, it was decided that the discovery well and three appraisals drilled on Ekofisk by Ocean Viking would be completed for production.
Principles for producing from Gulftide were relatively simple. Output flowed from the subsea wellheads to the platform, where it went through two-stage separation to remove gas and water.
With pressure also reduced, the gas was flared off and the oil sent on by flowlines to two loading buoys where shuttle tankers moored to take on cargo.

Production could only continue while ships were loading. As soon as one tanker had been filled, the oil stream was diverted to the vessel waiting at the other loading buoy.
The problem with this approach was manifested when weather conditions ­– strong winds and/or high waves – forced the tankers to leave the buoys.
If that happened, production from the wellheads had to be suspended immediately. Given the prevailing weather on Ekofisk, that happened regularly. Output was halted for 20 per cent of the time during the first year.
https://ekofisk.industriminne.no/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/Building-Ekofisk.mp4
Gulftide was replaced as the temporary production installation in 1974 by the permanent Ekofisk 2/4 A (Alpha) and 2/4 B (Bravo) platforms for production, drilling and quarters.
In addition came the Ekofisk 2/4 C (Charlie) production, drilling and compression facility, the Ekofisk 2/4 FTP (field terminal platform) for production and risers, and Ekofisk 2/4 Q for accommodation.
Oil and gas were produced by 2/4 A, B and C through their own wells for processing in their separation plants and piping on the 2/4 FTP for a three-stage separation process.
At the same time, the tanker loading buoys were moved further from the platforms and the Ekofisk 2/4 T oil storage tank became operational.
This facility was extremely advantageous, because it allowed production to continue virtually regardless of whether bad weather prevented tankers from connecting to the buoys.

The 2/4 FTP platform, where oil and gas from the three producing facilities was processed, had been planned to handle the level of output estimated for the main field.
Clear restrictions had been imposed by the Norwegian government on the amount of gas Phillips was allowed to flare. That also set a ceiling for oil production, since gas accompanies it up from the reservoir.
The solution was to install two powerful compression packages on 2/4 C in order to inject the gas under pressure back into the producing formation.
Accommodation facilities had to be provided on the two first platforms, 2/4 A and B. Where 2/4 C and FTP were concerned, however, they were tied together with bridges and to 2/4 Q.

A mere 17 months after the Ekofisk discovery was announced in December 1969, Gulftide was ready to come on stream as a temporary production platform.
Its official inauguration took place on 9 June, with initial test output commencing on 15 June. Full production began on 8 July.
The rig was chosen because it was available on the market. Established equipment for processing oil and gas was tailored to the limited space on board. Separate flowlines carried wellstreams from four subsea wells. Oil, gas and water were separated on board, with the gas flared and the oil piped to two buoys for loading into shuttle tankers.
Work on the process equipment was relatively simple. The problem was to tailor it to the rig. The subsea wellheads had to be reinforced to meet the demands posed by the North Sea, and a buoy loading system needed to be developed for waters where this technology had never been used before.
To gain time, it was decided that the three appraisal wells drilled by Ocean Viking to map the extent of the field – in addition to the discovery well – would be completed for production.

The producers would be topped with hydraulically controlled wellheads. Such equipment had been tried out on the seabed earlier, but on a limited scale and not in the deep and rough waters found on Ekofisk. This challenge was overcome by having the wellheads manufactured and then reinforced at the Phillips base in Dusavik outside Stavanger. Flowlines and control cables would also be laid from each well to Gulftide, with production comingled in a single riser to the topsides.
Weather conditions also represented a major problem when designing the loading buoys. Phillips itself had experience with such facilities, but the concept had only been used before in harbour-like conditions and waters no deeper than 27 metres. They were now to stand in 70 metres in the middle of the North Sea.
Gulftide was converted in the Åmøy Fjord outside Stavanger to cope with conditions on Ekofisk. The processing facilities were installed and reinforcements made to the derrick, helideck, hangar and leg structures.

Planning began in late 1970, when Phillips received approval to begin laying the flowlines between wellheads and rig. Brown & Root won this contract, with the first oil pipelines on the Norwegian continental shelf laid by the Hugh W Gordon laybarge.
The production principle on Gulftide was relatively simple. Output flowed from the subsea wellheads to the rig, where it passed through two separation levels to be split into oil and gas while the huge pressure was reduced.
Gas was flared off and the oil was piped to one of the loading buoys where a shuttle tanker was moored. Production could only take place when a ship was present.

As soon as one tanker had become fully laden, the oil flow was switched to the other buoy where another ship was waiting to take on cargo.
The problem with this approach arose when weather conditions meant the tankers had to cast off from the buoys because of strong winds or high waves. The rig then had to shut down production from the wellheads immediately.
Given the weather conditions found on Ekofisk, output regularly had to cease. Production was suspended for 20 per cent of the first year for this reason.
Output began cautiously on 8 July 1971 from a single well. The second producer came on stream that September, the third was ready the following month and all four were producing by February 1972. They each flowed 10 000 barrels of oil per day.

Norpipe H-7
This platform served as a pumping/compressor station to maintain pressure in the 443-kilometre Norpipe gas pipeline from Ekofisk to Emden in Germany, which became operational in September 1977.

Gas received initial compression to 132 bar at the Ekofisk Complex. The pipeline was divided into three equal lengths, with Norpipe GNSC B11 positioned at the end of the first third to maintain pressure as and when required.
From there, the gas then travelled the next third of the distance to the second and virtually identical compressor platform, H7.
This was also responsible for maintaining pressure, but additional compression was seldom required on this final leg of the journey to Emden.
Both platforms stood on the German continental shelf, but 48 kilometres of the pipeline also ran across the Danish North Sea sector.
The pipeline is trenched or covered with sand. On its final approach to the coast of East Friesland, it passes beneath the island of Juist before making landfall north of Emden.
Capacity in Norpipe is about 60 million standard cubic metres (scm) or 2.1 billion cubic feet per day. In addition to output from the Ekofisk-area fields, it carries gas from Valhall, Ula and the Statpipe system – primarily Statfjord and Gullfaks. Gas was also transported for a time from Hod and Gyda, but that has ceased.

Built in 1976, the B11 platform had six decks. Its permanent staffing totalled 14 people, but various service personnel were also often on board. The regular crew included three in catering.
The 11 Phillips employees comprised the offshore installation manager, the nurse/radio operator, eight operators and a roustabout.
In addition to their direct function, the operators covered various other trades which meant the crew was self-sufficient in most circumstances.
Both platforms obtained a satellite antenna in 1986 which allowed them to received Norwegian TV, while the 24-bed accommodation were redecorated in 1981 and upgraded in the summer of 1990.
Work on the upgrading largely comprised converting all cabins to doubles with shower and WC. The galley and changing rooms were renewed and changing facilities for women provided.
A new module with a lounge for non-smokers, a smoking room, gym and pool room was also installed. During this work, the West Gamma accommodation rig was positioned alongside.
Upgrading equipment on the platform was also initiated in 1990. While the pipeline’s original daily capacity had been estimated at 2 100 million standard cubic feet, this was found to have declined after a number of years to 1 975 million.
To return to the original capacity, the compressors needed to be upgraded and power supply from the turbines increased. This was done both on the Ekofisk tank and on the H7 and B11 platforms. Gas coolers on the tank were replaced as well.

The control systems were also upgraded in parallel. Control panels on turbines and compressors were replaced and metering instruments installed to conduct measurements in this equipment.
While the nearest neighbour to B11 was a Danish oil field, H7 stood in the middle of the shipping channel. M/S Hero broke down 15 nautical miles west of the latter platform at around 13.00 on 12 November 1977.
By 21.00, the ship was still adrift and heading directly for H7, and all 14 crew on the platform made ready to evacuate by helicopter – the waves were too high for the lifeboats. The wreck passed at 21.40 with a clearance of 400 metres.
German cargo carrier Reint collided with H7 on 30 September 1995, despite efforts by the standby ship to avert the threat. Production was halted as a safety measure, but the platform luckily suffered only minor damage. The collision was caused by inadequate watchkeeping on the ship’s bridge.
Operator responsibility for B11 and H7 was transferred at the beginning of 2003 to Norway’s state-owned Gassco company, which runs the Norwegian gas transport network.
This change had little significance for operation of the platforms, since the actual work was still carried out by ConocoPhillips as a technical service provider to Gassco.
H7 was shut down in 2007, and removal had been completed in 2013. In connection with preparations to remove the structure, operator responsibility was transferred to Statoil as the company in charge of the project on Gassco’s behalf.

Phillips inundates Sola with oil revenues
person by Kristin Øye Gjerde
Stavanger and neighbouring Sola were the first Norwegian local authorities to experience fantastic oil-related growth after the award of the first exploration licences in 1965.

The Shell refinery at Risavika in Sola was completed two years later, while the Norsco base in Tananger became operational as early as 1966.
But things really took off once the Ekofisk field had been discovered in the autumn of 1969 and started trial production on 14 July 1971.
Operator Phillips Petroleum Company moved its offices from the Dusavik base outside Stavanger to Tananger in Sola, and Shell could finally start refining Norwegian rather than imported crude.
Sola’s population now rose steadily from 8 400 in 1965 to 15 000 two decades later, and jobs grew even faster – from about 2 000 in 1970 to almost 8 000 in 1985. That averages 10 per cent annually.
Phillips and Shell became cornerstone companies. A large part of their workforce, particularly in Phillips, worked offshore. In addition came newly established oil supply firms.
More jobs were also created in retail, public administration, education, health and social care, personal services and so forth.
Although traditional agriculture remained important for the local authority, the number of farmers gradually declined as a result of mechanisation.[REMOVE]Fotnote: This article is based on the chapter “Elverket i Oljealderen” in I det regionale spenningsfelt.

The “agio tax”
The sharp rise in Sola’s revenues was attributable entirely to the oil industry, and it found itself in an enviable position during this period. Tax revenues rose even faster than population and jobs.
To give an indication, the local authority’s overall income from wealth and income taxes rose from NOK 9.3 million in 1966 to NOK 198 million in 1990. The biggest growth came in 1978-82, when it averaged 39 per cent a year.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Sola local authority, plans.
The secret behind this sharp increase was the tax paid by the oil companies – primarily Phillips – on agio, or the percentage fee charged when exchanging one currency for another.
Under Norwegian law at the time, the companies paid tax on their interest income to the local authority where they had their head office. In making this rule, however, the government had failed to take account of the considerable sums involved.
As operator of the Greater Ekofisk Area, Phillips had placed capital to be used for new investment in banks around the world – particularly the UK.
These deposits yielded substantial interest payments, and tax was payable on converting this income into Norwegian kroner.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Toralv Torstenbø, former chief executive officer in Sola local authority, interviewed by Kristin Øye Gjerde, 22 February 2001.
Sola council is said to have almost gone into shock the first time Phillips paid this agio tax. It suddenly had more money than it could spend.
During the 1970s and early 1980s, Sola’s municipal income always exceeded the budgeted amount. Large sums could be transferred every year to a capital fund.
Since the local authority was in a growth phase, additional funding was needed for the big developments it faced. While the rest of Norway experienced a slump in the late 1970s, Sola continued in top gear without a sign of unemployment.
Net income tax revenues came to NOK 55.5 million in 1978, while net spending was NOK 31.9 million. And these fantastic results went on improving.
By 1982, wealth and income taxes yielded NOK 203.4 million – compared with a budget of NOK 146 million, which was upgraded to NOK 190 million during the year.
According to Toralv Torstensbø, the financial controller, agio tax accounted for almost half this amount – in other words, as much as the tax paid by all other enterprises, private individuals and industry in Sola.
Its chief executive officer became a little overweening. In his comments on the 1982 budget, he declared that it would be “natural for Sola local authority to feel a strong regional responsibility and not to be too strict about the traditional division of costs between state, county and local authority.”
In line with this open-handed policy, Sola paid for both road projects and an upper secondary modern school which the county council was supposed to fund.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Chief executive officer’s budget proposal for Sola local authority covering 1974-85.
Tightening up petroleum tax
This unexpected prosperity undoubtedly created some jealously in the neighbouring local authorities, and the media began to show an interest in the issue.
Local daily Stavanger Aftenblad interviewed Sola’s chief executive and controller in 1981, when its photographer took a shot which illustrated the boundless wealth – Torstensbø stood showering hundred-krone notes over his colleague.
This story was not only read by the paper’s regular subscribers. The following day, 150 copies were distributed to members of the Storting (parliament).
That in turn prompted Centre Party representative Lars Velsand to make a passionate speech in which he described the position as a misuse of tax revenues.
He called on the government to intervene so that individual local authorities were unable to benefit in this way. Nor was he alone in finding it unreasonable that a small community like Sola should get so much money.
The result was an amendment to the Petroleum Tax Act on 11 June 1982, which specified that the proceeds from the agio tax should be transferred in future to central government.

Unfortunately, however, Sola had got used to consuming these revenues. It is easy to learn expensive habits, but not so straightforward to shrug them off again.
Matters had become a little unusual when the council’s executive board adopted the style of the oil company chiefs and took a helicopter outing during an ordinary budget meeting.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Oskar Goa, former chief technical officer in Sola local authority, interviewed by Kristin Øye Gjerde, 23 October 2000.
However, most of the tax money benefitted the general public. Paying for Sola upper secondary school and new national and county highways is an example of this.
The council also invested on local authority school buildings and community facilities such as the big sports complex at Åsen, with an outdoor athletics ground and two modern indoor arenas. Dysjaland and Tananger also acquired new sports arenas.
A new cultural centre built in central Sola has a distinctive architecture in brick and glass, with a grassed roof to blend with the surrounding Jæren landscape. With two stages and a public library, this became the community’s main venue for events and so forth.
The local authority thereby built up a very good infrastructure. Power cables were laid in the same trenches as water and sewage pipes, a network of cycle lanes was built and street lighting installed.
On the downside, virtually all these investments boosted operating expenses. The council’s running costs rose by an annual average of 30 per cent in 1978-84, with the biggest growth in the last three years of the period.
So the calls by Storting representatives to transfer agio tax receipts from councils to central government represented a real threat to local politicians.
Sola joined forces with other local authorities in the same position, including Stavanger, Oslo and Bærum as well as Rogaland county council.
A delegation met the Storting’s standing committee on finance to present their case, and secured a commitment to accept a phased reduction in revenues over four years.
The local authorities would receive 80 per cent of agio tax receipts during the first year, then 60 per cent, 40 per cent and finally 20 per cent.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Amendment to the Petroleum Tax Act adopted on 14 May 1982.
In reality, however, the run-down percentages were adjusted to extend over five years in annual steps of 80, 60, 20, 20 and 20 per cent. The total amount going to the local authorities was the same.
The arrangement was controversial to the last, and also uncertain because it had to be approved in each annual government budget.
Living within its means
After the tax change, Sola’s chief executive officer saw the writing on the wall. It seemed “to be unquestionable that [Sola] has seen its best days in purely financial terms and must return to setting tougher priorities for various assignments,” he asserted in connection with the budget process for 1983.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Chief executive officer’s budget proposal for Sola local authority, 1983.
It took the politicians a little longer to accept this reality, but they were forced to reduce investment and operating expenditures in the years which followed.
Cutting back on the new sports arenas and cultural centre was not very desirable. Nor was it pleasant to have to slow down. But savings had to be made, and long-terms spending plans were removed from the budget for possible reintroduction later.
A raft of measures were stripped from the budget in 1985, such as extensions to and modernisation of schools, sports arenas and swimming pools, a new somatic nursing home, housing for the intellectually disabled and sheltered housing. Grants for national and county roads were reduced.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Chief executive officer’s budget proposal for Sola local authority, 1985.
Once the government’s compensation scheme had ended, Torstensbø – now chief executive officer – told Stavanger Aftenblad that he did not want to paint too gloomy a picture.
“But it’s clear that we must set much more moderate financial priorities than we’ve been used to. To sum up the position, we were previously flush with cash and poor in facilities. We’re now flush with facilities and poor in cash.”[REMOVE]Fotnote: Stavanger Aftenblad, ”Alt blir dyrere i det rike Sola”, 19 May 1987.

Rogaland county council also raised the question of whether it would be possible to establish a permanent arrangement which allowed local authorities and counties to benefit from some of the tax revenues paid by local oil companies.
The council pointed out that it was otherwise normal practice for Norwegian companies to pay taxes to the local communities they were based in.
This request was turned by Labour finance minister Gunnar Berge because the councils concerned still benefitted from bigger tax payments by oil company employees and on property.[REMOVE]Fotnote: Stavanger Aftenblad, “Rogaland reiser skattekrav på ny”, 16 January 1988.
According to Torstensbø, this was only partly true. The big oil companies were not so significant for Sola’s income once the agio tax was excluded.
About NOK 2 million was received annually from Phillips, primarily in property tax. The most important taxpayers in the local authority were the roughly 90 companies at Aker Base. These were service providers such as Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes.
At the same time, Sola acquired a steadily growing number of affluent residents and a growing share of its revenue came from income tax. Despite the cut-backs, it remained prosperous.

More about economy
Participants in Ekofisk
The question of who “owns” Ekofisk is not straightforward. In simple terms, however, the field and the rest of Norway’s continental shelf (NCS) belongs to the Norwegian state. This was determined on 14 June 1963, when the Storting (parliament) passed the Act Relating to Exploration for and Exploitation of Submarine Natural Resources. This permits licences to be awarded on certain terms.
Riding out the oil crisis
The greatest-ever oil bonanza, with oil prices hitting USD 130 per barrel, came to an abrupt end in 2014, when the cost of a barrel of crude slumped to less than USD 50 from June to December. And the bottom had still not been reached – this was only the start of a new oil crisis which lasted several years. What effect did this have on ConocoPhillips’ financial position off Norway?",['The water depth in the Greater Ekofisk Area is 70-75 meters.'],6625,multifieldqa_en,en,,18ef34b54d2ddc134e1be7cae3d6101432465011d016c77a," Ekofisk began production on 15 June 1971, following its discovery in the autumn of 1969. The water depth in the Greater Ekofisk Area is 70-75 metres. The rate of seabed subsidence has declined sharply in recent years. The recovery factor on the field has risen from an original estimate of 17 per cent to over 50 per cent. The field is intended to produce until it is 2028 and is tied back to the Eldfisk and Embla complex, which was shut down in December 2015, as well as Tor and Tor Embla, which will remain in place until it can be developed. The Ekofisks West project was presented to improve the recovery and recovery capacity on Ek ofisk West in 2003, but it was cancelled in December 2014. The development of the West project is expected to be primarily focused on oil and gas processing. The project is also expected to increase the recovery factor and improve the reliability of the gas recovery process. The total number of fields in the area is 31, including Tommeliten G, Albuskjell, Cod, Edda, Tor, West Ekofsk and Tommel iten G. These fields all lie within production licence 018 apart from TommelIten G which was operated by Statoil from 1976 to 2003. The terminal at Teesside in north-east England receives oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) by pipeline from the Ekofisk field. It comprises stabilisation, NGL fractionation, storage tanks for crude oil and an export port. NGLs go to the fractionation facility, with a daily capacity of 64 000 barrels, for separation into methane, ethane, propane, and normal and iso butane. The methane (natural gas) is used to fuel the plant, while the other products (now known as liquefied petroleum gases – LPG) are made liquid by cooling and stored for export by sea. The terminal has four of these, with those for crudeOil able to handle tankers up to 150 000 deadweight tonnes. The LPG quays can accept carriers loading as much as 60 000 cubic metres. They are operated by Ruhrgas, BEB and Gastunie Gas Services (previously Gasunie) They connect to the pipeline systems to connect the terminal to the buyer receiving pipelines and distribution network. The gas enters the top of a column and leaves through the base after passing through a filter and oven. That leaves the gas ready for sale, and it is piped to the buyers. The Norsea Gas Terminal in Emden was officially opened in September 1977. A substantial proportion of Norway’s gas deliveries to Germany continues to arrive at the Emden terminal. The pipeline linking Ekofisk with the terminal for oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) at Teesside on the north-east English coast became operational in October 1975. In the UK sector, a 24-inch pipeline has been tied in with a Y connection to receive input from several British fields – including the J block developments operated by ConocoPhillips. The new terminal has not expanded export capacity. But its functionality is well adapted to future processing needs for fields in the Greater Ek ofisk Area and other parts of the NCS sending gas through the Norpipe system. The terminal has a daily capacity of about 2.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. It is owned by Norpipe Oil AS and operated by Norway Gas A/S. It has a capacity of around 2.5 million barrels of oil per day, but that capacity has never been required. It was opened on 24 May 2016 by Elisabeth Aspaker, the Norwegian government minister for the EU. Eldfisk 2/7 S is a remotely operated wellhead facility located 5.2 kilometres to the north of the Ekofisk Complex. The platform has six production wells and an average daily output of roughly 7 000 barrels of oil. The Embla reservoir has a temperature of 160°C compared with the 125°C normally found in the chalk formations 1 000 metres higher up. All processing and metering took place on Eldfisk 1/7 until 2015, and has now been switched to Eld fisk 2-7 S. The platforms are located in the Norwegian section of the North Sea, which is part of the Norwegian Continental Shelf. They are located between the islands of Stavanger and Gulleg in the north and the island of Juist in the south. For more information about platforms in the region, visit the Ek ofisk Complex website or visit the ConocoPhillips Ek of the Sea website or the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association’s Ek of The North Sea website.

For details on oil and natural gas exploration in Norway see the Norwegian National Oil & Natural Gas Company website. Ekofisk was discovered in December 1969 and production began in June 1971. Gulftide was a temporary production installation until 1974. The Ekofisk 2/4 A (Alpha) and 2-4 B (Bravo) platforms were built in 1973 and 1974. In addition came the Ekofsk 2/ 4 C (Charlie) production, drilling and compression facility, and the Ek ofisk 2.4 FTP (field terminal platform) for production and risers. The rig was equipped with process equipment and its derrick, helideck, hangar and legs were reinforced. Oil and gas were produced by two wells for processing in their separation plants and piping for a three-stage separation process. The gas was flared off and the oil sent on by flowlines to two loading buoys where shuttle tankers moored to take on cargo. The facility was extremely advantageous, because it allowed production to continue virtually regardless of whether bad weather prevented tankers from connecting to the buoys. It was replaced by a permanent installation in 1974, which is still in operation today. It is expected to be fully operational by the end of the year, with output estimated for the main field at around 1.5 million barrels of oil. Gulftide was converted in the Åmøy Fjord outside Stavanger to cope with conditions on Ekofisk. Production began cautiously on 8 July 1971 from a single well. The second producer came on stream that September, the third was ready the following month and all four were producing by February 1972. They each flowed 10 000 barrels of oil per day at the time. Production was suspended for 20 per cent of the first year for this reason. The oil was flared off and the oil was piped to one of the loading buoys where a shuttle tanker was moored. Production could only take place when a ship was present. The field was discovered in 1969 and the rig was built in 1970. It is now owned by Norway's state-owned oil company, Norges Petroleum, and is operated by Norway’s second-largest oil producer, Statoil. It has been the source of much of the oil and gas production in the North Sea since the 1970s and 1980s. The company has also been involved in the development of the Norwegian deep sea rig, the Barents Sea rig, and the Norwegian Deepwater Horizon oil rig, which are still in operation today. Norpipe GNSC B11 and H7 stood on the German continental shelf, but 48 kilometres of the pipeline also ran across the Danish North Sea sector.

In addition to output from the Ekofisk-area fields, it carries gas from Valhall, Ula and the Statpipe system – primarily Statfjord and Gullfaks. German cargo carrier Reint collided with H7 on 30 September 1995, despite efforts by the standby ship to avert the threat. Production was halted as a safety measure, but the platform luckily suffered minor damage. The collision was caused by inadequate watchkeeping on the ship's bridge.

Sola and neighbouring Stavanger were the first Norwegian local authorities to experience fantastic oil-related growth after the award of the first exploration licences in 1965. The Ekofisk field had been discovered in the autumn of 1969 and started trial production on 14 July 1971. Sola’s population now rose steadily from 8 400 in 1965 to 15 000 two decades later, and jobs grew even faster – from about 2 000 in 1970 to almost 8 000 in 1985. Tax revenues rose even faster than population and jobs. The secret behind this sharp increase was the tax paid by the oil companies – primarily Phillips – on agio, or the percentage fee charged when exchanging one currency for another. Phillips had placed capital to be used for new investment in banks around the world – particularly the UK – which yielded substantial interest payments, and tax payable on converting into Norwegian kroner. Former chief executive of Sola local authority, Kristin Øye Gjerde, said to have almost gone into shock when Phillips paid this agio tax for the first time in the 1970s and 1980s. The biggest growth came in 1978-82, when it averaged 39 per cent a year. The “agio tax” was attributable entirely to the oil industry. In 1978, income tax revenues came to NOK 55.5 million in 1978, while net spending was NOK 31.9 million. By 1982, wealth and income taxes yielded NOK 203.4 million – compared with a budget of NOK 146 million. Sola paid for both road projects and an upper secondary modern school which the county council was supposed to fund. The result was an amendment to the Petroleum Tax Act on 11 June 1982, which specified that the proceeds from the agio tax should be transferred in future to central government. But Sola had got used to consuming these revenues. It is easy to learn expensive habits, but not so straightforward to shrug them off again. A new cultural centre built in central Sola has a distinctive architecture in brick and glass, with a grassed roof to blend with the surrounding Jæren landscape. With two stages and a library, this community’s main venue for events and so forth became a very public public authority. Power cables were laid up in the same trenches and sewage pipes, a network of cycle lanes was built. The local authority built up a very good infrastructure. Sola joined forces with other local authorities in the same position, including Stavanger, Oslo and Bærum as well as Rogaland county council. A delegation met the Storting’s standing committee on finance to present their case, and secured a commitment to accept a phased reduction in revenues over four years. The local authorities would receive 80 per cent of agio tax receipts during the first year, then 60 per cent, 40 per cent and finally 20 per cent. In reality, however, the run-down percentages were adjusted to extend over five years in annual steps of 80, 60, 20, 20 and 20%. The total amount going to the local authorities was the same. The arrangement was controversial to the last, and also uncertain because it had to be approved in each annual government budget. It took the politicians a little longer to accept this reality, but they were forced to reduce investment and operating expenditures in the years which followed. A raft of measures were stripped from the budget in 1985, such as extensions to and modernisation of schools, sports arenas and swimming pools. Grants for national and county roads were reduced. The greatest-ever oil bonanza, with oil prices hitting USD 130 per barrel, came to an abrupt end in 2014. The cost of a barrel of crude slumped to less than USD 50 from June to December. This was only the start of a new oil crisis which lasted several years. What effect did this have on ConocoPhillips’ financial position off Norway?"
What were the vaccines trialed against?,"A special tribute to Del Bigtree (pictured) and his team at ICAN for his stunning 88 page letter to the HHS regarding vaccine safety. As Del reported - in the latest edition of Highwire - the letter, in response to an earlier reply from the then acting Director National Vaccine Program Office, Melinda Wharton, took virtually a year to compile, and is a meticulous piece of research. Most sensationally they researched the HHS claim through US government archives that at least some pediatric vaccines had been trialed against genuine placebo, and came to a negative conclusion. Not only that, they established that none of the vaccines those vaccines had been trialed against had ever been trialed against genuine placebo either. At the end of the line the toxic products were only being compared with other toxic products, rather than against saline.
Leave aside the sceptics, for any believer in the vaccine program as a necessary intervention in public health, this should be a devastating finding. Fundamentally, the research into the safety of any of the products before marketing was simply not there. The manufacturers apparently had no faith that their proto-products could withstand this scrutiny, and for the rest they just did not care: under the alleged imperative of protecting the population it seems anything went. So even before all the sham monitoring procedures and reviews which Del and his team dismantle in forensic detail we are left with the proposition that none of the present products being given to US children – and frequently other children across most of the developed world – have any meaningful pre-marketing safety data all. If you are believer in the program you have been let down: if you wanted a program with any pretensions to safety - supposing such a thing to be possible - it looks like you would have to start from scratch. The manufacturers did this: the governments, the politicians and the regulators (internationally) let it happen.
This damning document is published simultaneously with a demand in the UK from the Royal Society for Public Health (which I had never heard of) to shut down comment about vaccines on the web. It echoes calls from Seth Berkley of GAVI, Heidi Larson of the Vaccine Confidence Project and the European Parliament. The pamphlet airily dismisses concerns that vaccines have side effects or that you could possibly have too many. It is pure public relations, and if the RSPH claims to be ""independent"" it also admits that the publication was paid for by Merck, a detail which was reported by British Medical Journal and the Guardian, but not true to form by the BBC. We have, in truth, been building to this moment for two decades: as the evidence piles up that every single aspect of the program lacks integrity or is simply rotten to the core all the perpetrators can do is call for the silencing of their critics, and maintain the products are safe because they say so.
Please help give the ICAN letter the widest possible distribution, particularly to politicians.
""The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system.""
Nope. This makes no sense. Lots of people who seemed vibrant will get a very severe case of the same illness that a vulnerable baby overcomes in a day.
And under the germ theory it doesn't matter how strong your immune system *was*. Once it's been overcome by the pathogen it is every bit as weak as anybody else's with that pathogen.
What you say makes no sense. There's no reason for me to reply to you again.
""Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared?""
Why do you keep asking this question when I've already provided the answer hundreds of times? Why are you so desperate to believe the people who you already recognize are harming our children?
Why would Walter Reed be any more trustworthy than Paul Offit or Senator Pan? Why would Jenner or Pasteur?
And you went no way to explaining my arguments against germ theory. If we are attacked by billions of viruses every day then if even a tiny fraction of them are pathogenic then we couldn't possibly survive. And even if we could, we would already be immune rendering every vaccine pointless. Once we had survived our first few days on earth, then we could never get sick again.
If that's wrong then we must conclude that precisely 0% of germs are pathogenic.
Plus your comment about the immune system completely misunderstood my point. The immune system does not allow us to overcome our math problem. In fact, it makes it worse.
You did provide one solitary example of a patient with what are presumably yellow fever symptoms but you didn't say whether they had been given any toxic medical treatments.
And like I said before, the whole ""incubation period"" is more than a little suspicious. Clearly they never found what they thought they would and just rigged the results to tell them what they want to hear.
Like every other germ theorist/vaccine promoter in history.
Many kinds of bacteria are constantly evolving and changing, like flu viruses. Others are more stable over time, like the yellow fever virus. Those that change develop new ways of infiltrating the cells of the organism being attacked (from our point of view, from its unconscious point of view, it's just carrying out its need to replicate, which it can only do inside the cells of its host). The changes which allow it to better infiltrate are more successful and result in more viruses with those traits.
Our immune system is designed to detect and destroy potentially dangerous invading pathogens. Many bacteria are usually harmless and absolutely necessary. The minority are dangerous, and most people's immune systems do a good job of analyzing them and killing them, often with no signs of disease. Others experience a clinical infection, and the immune system usually mounts a successful attack on them.
The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system. Vaccines are usually effective in giving immunity to the targeted diseases. They also have many dangers which everyone should be aware of, and vaccines should be avoided whenever possible. But in the case of the most dangerous diseases, everyone should learn about them and think about what he wants to do to protect himself and his children from them, considering all the factors involved. And no one can have 100% certainty that he has made the right decision, but that's life. But if you live in the Congo and many people around you are currently dying of yellow fever, then that means that you yourself are at risk of being bitten by a loaded mosquito and getting, often dying, of yellow fever. The yellow fever vaccine is very effective at preventing yellow fever. From there, each person must make a choice.
At the end of this stage there is a remission of two or three days. About 80% of those with clinical disease recover at this point, with permanent immunity. The other 20% enter the toxic stage, with a return of the fever, black vomit (coffee-ground emesis), diarrhea, a slowing of the pulse (Faget's sign), jaundice, yellow eyes, yellow skin, and failure of the kidneys, liver, and heart. The patient gets a strange hiccup (like with Ebola, a related disease), falls into a coma, and dies. About half of those patients who enter the toxic stage dies, even now, even with the best of hospital care. The Faget's sign can also occur at the end of the first stage.
You asked specifically about the symptoms of the Americans on Dr. Reed's team who got yellow fever in Cuba in 1900. I'll give the passage from The American Plague (162-5), which describes the course of Jesse Lazear's illness. ""In his logbook, Lazear wrote an unusual entry on September 13. In all cases before those, page after page of records, Lazear had used the soldier's name and simply the date he was bitten, with no other attention to the mosquito. A one-line entry with a name and a date. On that day, however, in his elegant hand, Lazear did not write the soldier's name, but instead wrote 'Guinea Pig No. 1.' He went on to write that this guinea pig had been bitten by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that fed on a number of yellow fever cases: Suarez, Hernández, De Long, Ferández. It was a precise, detailed history that proved beyond doubt that the mosquito was loaded with the virus when it bit a healthy soldier...(If he had entered his name, then his death would have been considered medical suicide by the insurance company, and his wife and two children would not have gotten any payment.) For the next few days, Lazear's life continued much as it had over the last few months in Cuba. He fed and cared for the mosquitoes in the lab. ..Then he began to lose his appetite. He skipped a few meals in the mess hall. He didn't mention it to anyone, nor did he ask to see one of the yellow fever doctors; instead, he worked hard in the lab trying to ignore the oncoming headache.
""On September 18, he complained of feeling 'out of sorts,' and stayed in his officer's quarters. His head pounded and L. decided to write a letter. ..(he wrote to his mother, and referred to his one-year old son Houston and the baby his wife Mabel was about to have: they were staying with his mother in the US). ..That night, L. started to feel chilled as the fever came on. He never went to sleep but worked at his desk all through the night, trying to get all the information about the mosquitoes organized. By morning, he showed all the signs of a severe attack of yellow fever. The camp doctors made the diagnosis, and L. agreed to go to the yellow fever ward. ..L. was carried by litter out of the two-room, white pine board house in which he had lived since he and Mabel first arrived in Cuba. ..(In the yellow fever ward, in a separate one-room building), Lena Warner (the immune nurse who had survived the yellow fever in 1878, when she was nine, and was found in her boarded-up house by a former slave who first thought she was dead, and carried her to safety) nursed J.L., recording his vitals. (I put up a link to his case record and vital signs last week. The surgeon general required that this record be made for every yellow fever patient.)... (On September 25,) Lena Warner braced L's arms with all of her weight, shouting for help. Still he bolted from the bed, darting around the small frame-wood room as wildly as a trapped insect beating against glass. Two soldiers ran into the ward, pinning L to his bed, tying restraints around his wrists and elbows. ..Warner sponged his body with iced whiskey and water. She recorded his temperature, which had held at 104 degrees for days, on the chart beside his bed. ..(Warner watched him sleep.) But the quiet did not last. L's body began to lurch, and black vomit rolled from his mouth; through the bar hanging above his hospital cot. He writhed in the bed, and his skin grew deep yellow. His 104 temperature slowly fell, leveling out 99 degrees, and JL died at 8:45 p.m. at the age of thirty-four.""
As is obvious, there are many problems with vaccines. But, that being said, most of them usually work for a period of time to prevent the targeted diseases. The basic science behind vaccines is correct. Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared? In the case of the routine childhood diseases, this was a bad thing, but it is a true thing.
Vaccines usually don't cause any obvious reactions. While they usually prevent the diseases, and that's why people continue to get them. With the increasing vaccination schedule, more and more are severely and permanently damaged, and it is immoral to mandate any vaccine for anyone for this reason. But it would also be immoral to prohibit vaccines for those who want them enough to take the risk.
Your article said as though it had any probative value that 90% of those who get pertussis had been vaxxed. The old DPT vaccine was MUCH more effective at preventing pertussis, but it was so dangerous (again, not to most, but to many), that developed countries replaced it with the acellular version, DTaP. From the beginning about twenty years ago, it was clear that it was not very effective and that huge numbers of vaxxed people got pertussis anyway, including my daughter who got pertussis at eight month old after having gotten three DTaPs. The pertussis vaccine continues to be very dangerous, and I do not recommend that anyone get it. It used to be a killer disease, but evolved to become much milder, to the extent that the disease is very rarely dangerous (usually only to newborns under three months old), while the vaccine is very dangerous. And they're trying to see how they can go back to the old DPT. This does not show that vaccine science has collapsed, but rather that the vaccine they developed to replace the DPT turned out to be much less effective than they first thought, while continuing to be much more dangerous than they first thought.
Your article extrapolated from that that modern medical science in general has collapsed, but that, again, is going too far. A older woman in Mexico City who is like my mother to me had a pacemaker inserted about two months ago to aid her failing heart, and it has restored her to optimism and energy, when she was despondent, weak, and close to death. I took my daughter to the dentist yesterday, who said she has three wisdom teeth coming in and that she said that the lower right one was sore. So, although I am cautious about X-rays, I made an appointment for a panoramic X-ray in a month to assess the wisdom teeth, and, if it seems appropriate, I'll take her to an oral surgeon to have one or more extracted under IV sedation, in his office, if possible (the dentist thought that it would be). And I am confident that there will be no serious problems, but this is thanks to technology and training in modern medicine that haven't been available for that long.
I think that everyone should inform himself on all medical procedures before agreeing to anything, but I also think that he should have access to any medical procedure which is reasonable (and opinions can differ as to that).
One problem is that you have not said how you think people should protect themselves against tetanus, bacterial meningitis, and yellow fever in the relevant cases, for example. These are diseases which healthy, well-nourished people used to die from very readily.
If most people stopped vaxxing and the mortality from these diseases rose to something like pre-vaccine levels, do you think they should just accept dying from them?
I put that in a separate paragraph because it is the crucial issue.

Hans, you are right that we are looking at one of the biggest crimes in all history. When I read the story of that poor girl who was so healthy and is now confined to a wheelchair after getting her third Gardasil shot I could not believe that Merck could produce such a toxic vaccine and give it out to girls like it was something they absolutely had to have only to be mislead and made into cripples. Merck should be prosecuted for the damage they have done to so many girls who got the Gardasil vaccine and were physically debilitated for life. There is a place for the people who perpetrated this crime on young girls and women and it is called hell. They have destroyed people's lives and gotten away with it. My heart goes out to those who have suffered this damage for no damn good reason except to help make huge profits for Merck!
Here is the reason that the germ theory is nonsense.
1) Everyday we are bombarded with billions of germs. Presumably at least some of them are of the kind that germ theorists believe are dangerous (otherwise we would have to conclude that none of them are dangerous). So how do we survive?
2) Let's just say that we ignore 1 and imagine that, by way of magic, none of the billions of viruses we get bombarded with are pathogenic but all those that are are tucked away somewhere. Ok. But presumably they reside in sick people right? So where are there lots of sick people? Doctor offices and hospitals! So everybody must be dying the moment they enter these places right?
3) I love this one because I have never seen anybody else ever raise it. Under the germ theory there are no negative feedbacks. This makes a stable biological system by definition impossible. The immune system is *not* a negative feedback it is the opposite. It actually reinforces our math problem because the immune system will weaken as the number of pathogens increase.
There is no way of resolving this problem without a discontinuity. A Deus ex Machina as The Almighty Pill so beautifully put it. So the germ theory is quite literally, mathematically impossible.
There is as much chance of it being true as 2+2 = 5.
There are plenty of other massive problems with germ theory such as why did things like SARS and bird flu magically disappear? Why do we have the symptoms that we do? Is our body controlling the symptoms to help fight the germs and if so, why would suppressing the symptoms with antibiotics or Tamiflu be considered a good idea? If the virus is causing the symptoms then why would it cause these kinds of things?",['Other toxic products.'],3141,multifieldqa_en,en,,74334862b5d8e2a02deb3c24aa90d5339e443fbc412453b8," Del Bigtree and his team at ICAN wrote 88 page letter to the HHS regarding vaccine safety.

abstract

We introduce a quantum error mitigation technique based on probabilistic error cancellation to eliminate errors which have accumulated during the application of a quantum circuit. Our approach is based on applying an optimal ""denoiser"" after the action of a noisy circuit and can be performed with an arbitrary number of extra gates.
The denoiser is given by an ensemble of circuits distributed with a quasiprobability distribution. For a simple noise model, we show that efficient, local denoisers can be found, and we demonstrate their effectiveness for the digital quantum simulation of the time evolution of simple spin chains. Introduction.
-Quantum information processing has been theoretically shown to hold great promises, and quantum algorithms were developed which can in principle achieve an exponential speed-up over their classical counterparts, both for general purpose computing and quantum simulation . However, present day quantum computing prototypes still suffer from significant noise processes which hinder the execution of many potentially groundbreaking quantum algorithms .
Nontrivial quantum algorithms typically require large sequences of quantum gates, each of which introduces dissipation and hence an overall loss of coherence, eventually rendering the results useless. Until quantum error correction becomes practical, quantum error mitigation seems to be more feasible to increase the accuracy of expectation values.
Here the goal is to induce the (partial) cancellation of errors that stem from noisy quantum gates by extending the circuit corresponding to the desired algorithm with an ensemble of gates , sampled from a quasiprobability distribution. The traditional way to accomplish this is with the gatewise method from , where noise is mitigated by inverting the noise channel of each gate separately, i.e. the cancellation of errors is performed for each gate on its own.
Here the local noise channel is approximated in a way such that it can be easily inverted analytically, e.g. using Pauli twirling . Gates are then sampled from the inverted noise channel by interpreting it as a quasiprobability distribution. Because in this gate-wise approach every noisy gate has to be modified separately, the sign problem is exponentially large in the number of gates, limiting the practicality of the mitigation.
The success of the gate-wise approach resulted in a large body of work concerning these methods , including extensions for simultaneous mitigation of multiple gates by Pauli-twirling entire layers or variationally constructing a mitigating matrix product operator . In principle, errors during the execution of a circuit can propagate and accumulate.

FIG. 1. An example of the quantum error mitigation procedure used in this work for the time evolution of the wave function of a spin chain. The ideal second-order Trotter supercircuit C of depth Mtrot = 1 (light blue) is approximated by applying a denoiser D of depth M = 1 (red) to the noisy Trotter supercircuit C (dark blue).
Because the denoiser is applied after fully executing the noisy Trotter supercircuit, it represents an approximate inverse of the global noise channel with a precision tunable by the depth of the denoiser. can potentially blow up and lead to large errors for the circuit as a whole . Here we introduce a mitigation technique that takes into account the propagation of errors, can be performed with a tunable number of extra gates, and works for non-Clifford local noise channels since the inversion of the accumulated global noise channel is implicit.
We first execute the targeted noisy circuit completely, letting the noise propagate and accumulate, and only afterwards we apply an extra random circuit sampled from a quasiprobability distribution. We call the corresponding ensemble of random circuits a denoiser, and we construct it such that upon averaging the accumulated errors cancel.
Essentially, the denoiser inverts a global noise channel. Since we will construct it as a local brickwall circuit, following the classical preprocessing approach from , we call this compressed quantum error mitigation. Method. -Due to the inevitable coupling of a quantum processor to its environment, every qubit operation is affected by noise.
Therefore, the simplest technique to minimize the impact of the resulting noise is to minimize the number of operations when performing a quantum algorithm. In we showed that many-body time evolution operators can be efficiently compressed into brick-wall circuits with high fidelity per gate. In this Letter, we consider the noise explicitly by treating quantum operations as (generally non-unitary) quantum channels, corresponding to completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) maps .
For example, instead of a noiseless two-qubit gate G, which acts on a quantum state |ρ in superoperator form as G|ρ = G⊗G * |ρ , we get the noisy channel G = N G, where the noise channel N implements the two-qubit noise . These channels are used to construct a ""supercircuit"" C = N G i=1 Gi , consisting of N G channels, which is affected by multi-qubit accumulated noise.
This supercircuit encodes an ensemble of circuits . For simplicity, we assume that the noisy channels Gi in each half brickwall layer are lattice inversion and translation invariant, such that we can construct a denoiser with these properties, limiting the number of variational parameters. The purpose of quantum error mitigation is to modify the ensemble of circuits described by C in a way that we can use it to obtain the noiseless expectation values.
In superoperator language, we do this by following the supercircuit C with a denoiser supercircuit D, such that D C is as close to the noiseless supercircuit C = C ⊗ C * as possible. Here C is the target unitary circuit. Because the noise channel N is non-unitary, hence making the supercircuit C non-unitary, we need to use a non-unitary denoiser to retrieve the unitary C.
We illustrate the mitigation procedure in Fig. , where a denoiser with one layer is used to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with one layer. This circuit architecture is commonly used to simulate the time evolution of a quantum many-body system, until some time t, with controllable precision , and we will use it to benchmark the denoiser.
In practice, we cannot directly implement a supercircuit, and so we have to utilize its interpretation as an ensemble of circuits. Essentially, after executing a shot of the noisy circuit we sample the denoiser and apply it. The goal is to construct the denoiser in a way that averaging over many of its samples cancels the accumulated errors and gives us a good approximation of the noiseless expectation values.
It should be noted that our approach requires more gate applications on the quantum processor than with the gate-wise scheme, since there each sample from the mitigation quasiprobability distribution can be absorbed into the original circuit, whereas our approach increases the circuit depth. We take this into account by imposing the same noise on the denoiser.
Furthermore, within our scheme, the dimensionality of the quasiprobabilistic mitigating ensemble can be controlled, in contrast to the gate-wise approach where it is equal to the gate count. To facilitate the stochastic interpretation we parameterize each two-qubit denoiser channel G i as a sum of CPTP maps, such that we can sample the terms in this sum and execute the sampled gate on the quantum processor.
Concretely, we use a trace preserv-ing sum of a unitary and a non-unitary channel. For the unitary part we take a two-qubit unitary channel U( φ i ) = U ( φ i ) ⊗ U * ( φ i ), with U ( φ i ) a two-qubit unitary gate parameterized by φ i . For this we take the two-qubit ZZ rotation exp(−iα(σ z ⊗ σ z )) with angle α, which can be obtained from native gates on current hardware , and dress it with four general one-qubit unitaries, only two of which are independent if we want a circuit that is space inversion symmetric around every bond.
The resulting gate has 7 real parameters φ i . For the non-unitary part, which is essential because D has to cancel the non-unitary accumulated noise to obtain the noiseless unitary circuit, we use a general onequbit measurement followed by conditional preparation channel M( , with V a general one-qubit unitary and each κ i a 3-dimensional vector, resulting in a real 9-dimensional ζ i .
This yields the two-qubit correlated measurement M( With these parts we construct the parameterization with coefficients η i ∈ R that satisfy η 0 + η 1 = 1 because G i is trace preserving. Note that here the tensor product symbol corresponds to combining two one-qubit channels to make a two-qubit channel, whereas in most of the paper it is used to link the column and row indices of a density matrix.
We construct the denoiser from the noisy channels Gi = N G i . With this parameterization one denoiser channel has 17 independent real parameters, such that a denoiser of depth M , i.e. consisting of M brickwall layers, has 34M real parameters (we use one unique channel per half brickwall layer). For reference, a general channel has 544M parameters.
To determine the mitigated expectation values we use the full expression where |ρ 0 is the initial state and |1 is the vectorized identity operator on the full Hilbert space. To evaluate this on a quantum processor, we use the stochastic interpretation of (1) to resample . In particular, from each channel (1) we get a unitary with probability p 0 = |η 0 |/γ and a measurement followed by conditional preparation with probability p 1 = |η 1 |/γ.
Here γ = |η 0 | + |η 1 | is the sampling overhead, which characterizes the magnitude of the sign problem from negative η i . For quasiprobability distributions, i.e. with γ > 1, every denoiser sample has an extra sign sgn(η) = N G g=1 sgn(η g ), 2. The normalized distance between the denoised Trotter supercircuit D C and the noiseless Trotter supercircuit C (top panels), at evolution times t = 0.5, 1, ..., 5, and the twopoint z-spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (t) of a spin on the middle site at times 0 and t (bottom panels), for the infinite temperature initial state.
We consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and second-order Trotter circuits with depths Mtrot = 16, 32, 64. In the top panels we use a Heisenberg chain with L = 8, and in the bottom panels with L = 14, both with periodic boundary conditions. All gates are affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p = 0.01.
The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0, and the noiseless values with p = 0. where sgn(η g ) is the sign of the sampled coefficient of the gth channel. γ = 1 means that all signs are positive. Observables Ô p=0 for the noiseless circuit are then approximated by resampling the observables from the denoiser ensemble
where γ = N G g=1 γ g is the overall sampling overhead, with γ g the overhead of the gth gate. Clearly, a large γ implies a large variance of Ô p=0 for a given number of samples, with accurate estimation requiring the cancellation of large signed terms. The number of samples required to resolve this cancellation of signs is bounded by Hoeffding's inequality, which states that a sufficient number of samples to estimate Ô p=0 with error δ at probability 1 − ω is bounded by (2γ 2 /δ 2 ) ln(2/ω) .
Since γ scales exponentially in γ g , it is clear that a denoiser with large M and γ 1 will require many samples. We observed that decompositions with γ > 1 are crucial for an accurate denoiser. Restricting to γ = 1 leads to large infidelity and no improvement upon increasing the number of terms in or the depth M of the denoiser.
Simply put, probabilistic error cancellation of gate noise introduces a sign problem and it is crucial to find optimal parameterizations (1) which minimize γ to make the approach scalable. This issue arises in all high performance error mitigation schemes , because the inverse of a physical noise channel is unphysical and cannot be represented as a positive sum over CPTP maps.
This is clearly visible in the spectra of the denoiser, which lies outside the unit circle (cf. Fig. ). This makes the tunability of the number of gates in each denoiser sample a crucial ingredient, which allows control over the sign problem, because we can freely choose the η i in . For the parametrization (1) of denoiser channels, we try to find a set of parameters for error mitigation by minimizing the normalized Frobenius distance between the noiseless and denoised supercircuits
which bounds the distance of output density matrices and becomes zero for perfect denoising. We carry out the minimization of on a classical processor, using gradient descent with the differential programming algorithm from . Instead of explicitly calculating the accumulated global noise channel and subsequently inverting it, we approximate the noiseless supercircuit C with the denoised supercircuit D C, effectively yielding a circuit representation D of the inverse noise channel.
Results. -To benchmark the denoiser we apply it to the second-order Trotter circuits of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) where is the Pauli algebra acting on the local Hilbert space of site i. A second-order Trotter circuit for evolution time t with depth M trot consists of M trot − 1 half brickwall layers with time step t/M trot and two layers with half time step .
We consider circuits that are affected by uniform depolarizing noise with probability p for simplicity, but our approach can be used for any non-Clifford noise. The two-qubit noise channel is which acts on neighboring qubits i and i + 1 and is applied to each Trotter and denoiser gate, and p = 0.01 unless stated otherwise.
We study circuits with depths M trot = 16, 32, 64 for evolution times t = 0.5, 1, ..., 5, and denoisers D with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8. In the top panels of Fig. we show (4) for a chain of size L = 8 as a function of time t. Here it can be seen that even for M trot = 32 a denoiser with M = 1 already improves by roughly an order of magnitude at all considered t.
Depending on M trot and t, further increasing M lowers , with the biggest improvements occurring for high precision Trotter circuits with large depth M trot = 64 and short time t = 0.5, where the Trotter gates are closer to the identity than in the other cases. At the other extreme, for M trot = 16 the improvements are relatively small upon increasing M > 2. In all cases the denoiser works better at early times than at late times, again indicating that it is easier to denoise Trotter gates that are relatively close to the identity.
To probe the accuracy of the denoiser on quantities that do not enter the optimization, as a first test we consider the two-point correlator between spins at different times where we have chosen the infinite temperature initial state, and C(t) is the Trotter supercircuit for time t. In the bottom panels of Fig. we show C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (t) for the supercircuits from the upper panels, now for a L = 14 chain.
Here we see that at M trot = 16 we can retrieve the noiseless values already with M = 1, but that increasing M trot makes this more difficult. At M trot = 64 we see larger deviations, and improvement upon increasing M is less stable, but nonetheless we are able to mitigate errors to a large extent. As a further test, we compute the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) ]
In Fig. we show the results for i = L/2, for a Trotter circuit with depth M trot = 32 and a denoiser with depth M = 2. Here we see that a denoiser with M M trot is able to recover the light-cone of correlations, which are otherwise buried by the noise. In the Supplementary Material we consider how the denoiser performs at different noise levels p, and how the denoised supercircuits perform under stacking.
There we also calculate domain wall magnetization dynamics, and show the distribution of the optimized denoiser parameters and the sampling overhead associated to the denoiser as a whole. In Fig. we show the eigenvalues of the noisy supercircuits for a noisy second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 at t = 1 (left), the corresponding optimized denoiser with M = 4 (center), and the denoised supercircuit (right).
The eigenvalues λ of a unitary supercircuit lie on the unit circle, and in the presence of dissipation they are pushed to the center. We see that the spectrum of the denoiser lies outside the unit circle, making it an unphysical channel which cures the effect of the noise on the circuit, such that the spectrum of the denoised circuit is pushed back to the unit circle.
The noiseless eigenvalues are shown as blue bars, making it clear that the denoiser is able to recover the noiseless eigenvalues from the noisy circuit. In the Supplementary Material we show the spectra for a p = 0.036 denoiser, where we observe a clustering of eigenvalues reminiscent of Refs. . There we also investigate the channel entropy of the various supercircuits .
Conclusion. -We have introduced a probabilistic error cancellation scheme, where a classically determined denoiser mitigates the accumulated noise of a (generally non-Clifford) local noise channel. The required number of mitigation gates, i.e. the dimensionality of the corresponding quasiprobability distribution, is tunable and the parameterization of the corresponding channels provides control over the sign problem that is inherent to probabilistic error cancellation.
We have shown that a denoiser with one layer can already significantly mitigate errors for second-order Trotter circuits with up to 64 layers. This effectiveness of low-depth compressed circuits for denoising, in contrast with the noiseless time evolution operator compression from , can be understood from the non-unitarity of the denoiser channels.
In particu-lar, measurements can have non-local effects, since the measurement of a single qubit can reduce some highly entangled state (e.g. a GHZ state) to a product state, whereas in unitary circuits the spreading of correlations forms a light-cone. To optimize a denoiser with convenience at L > 8, the optimization can be formulated in terms of matrix product operators or channels , which is convenient because the circuit calculations leading to the normalized distance and its gradient are easily formulated in terms of tensor contractions and singular value decompositions .
This provides one route to a practical denoiser, which is relevant because the targeted noiseless circuit and the accompanying noisy variant in (4) need to be simulated classically, confining the optimization procedure to limited system sizes with an exact treatment or limited entanglement with tensor networks.
Nonetheless, we can use e.g. matrix product operators to calculate (4) for some relatively small t, such that the noiseless and denoised supercircuits in (4) have relatively small entanglement, and then stack the final denoised supercircuit on a quantum processor to generate classically intractable states.
Analogously, we can optimize the channels exactly at some classically tractable size and then execute them on a quantum processor with larger size. Both approaches are limited by the light-cone of many-body correlations, as visualized in Fig. , because finite-size effects appear when the light-cone width becomes comparable with system size.
1. The normalized distance (left) and z spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (right), for a second-order Trotter supercircuit of depth Mtrot = 16 for time t = 1, affected by various twoqubit depolarizing errors p. We compare the values obtained with and without a denoiser, i.e. M > 0 and M = 0, to the noiseless values (p = 0).
The denoiser is affected by the same noise as the Trotter circuit. We consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and we use a L = 8 Heisenberg chain with PBC for the normalized distance, while for the correlator we use L = 14. * david.luitz@uni-bonn.de to observe that even for larger noise strength p, the local observable C zz improves significantly even with denoisers of depth M = 1.
For large noise strengths, we generally see that the optimization of the denoiser becomes difficult, leading to nonmonotonic behavior as a function of p, presumably because we do not find the global optimum of the denoiser. It is interesting to analyze the spectra of the supercircuits considered in this work.
As mentioned in the main text, the spectrum of the ideal, unitary supercircuit C lies on the unit circle. The comparison to this case is therefore instructive. In the main text, we showed an example of the spectra in Fig. for moderate noise strength. Here, we show additional data for stronger noise p = 0.036 in Fig. for a denoiser with M = 4 layers, optimized to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 layers at time t = 1.
The eigenvalues λ of the noisy supercircuit C are clustered close to zero, far away from the unit circle (except for λ = 1), showing that the circuit is strongly affected by the noise. To mitigate the impact of the noise, the denoiser consequently has to renormalize the spectrum strongly. If it accurately represents the inverse of the global noise channel, its spectrum has to lie far outside the unit circle, which is the case.
Interestingly, we observe a clustering of eigenvalues which is reminiscent to the spectra found in . By comparison to these works, we suspect that this is due to the local nature of the denoiser, and warrants further investigation. The right panel of Fig. shows the result of the denoiser, pushing the eigenvalues back to the unit circle, nearly with the exact same distribution along the circle as the noiseless eigenvalues (blue bars).
Due to the strong noise, this is not achieved perfectly, and it is clear that this cannot work in principle if the global noise channel has a zero eigenvalue. The complexity of an operator can be quantified by its operator entanglement entropy . Here we calculate the half-chain channel entanglement entropy S of the noiseless C, noisy C, denoiser D, and denoised D C supercircuits.
We define S as the entanglement entropy of the state that is related to a supercircuit C via the Choi-Jamio lkowski isomorphism, i.e. ψ C = χ C /N , where the process matrix χ ab,cd C = C ac,bd is simply a reshaped supercircuit and N ensures normalization. Then we have S = −Tr [ψ C ln ψ C ]. This entropy measure is a particular instance of the ""exchange entropy"", which characterizes the information exchange between a quantum system and its environment .
In Fig. we plot the various S for a second-order Trotter circuit with M trot = 16 at t = 2, for a denoiser with M = 4, both affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p ∈ [10 −3 , 10 −1 ]. The Trotter circuit is for a Heisenberg model with L = 6 and PBC. We see that at large p, the noise destroys entanglement in the noisy supercircuit, and that the denoiser S increases to correct for this, such that the denoised supercircuit recovers the noiseless S.
Here we investigate how denoised supercircuits perform upon repeated application. We optimize the denoiser for a Trotter supercircuit for a fixed evolution time t. Then, to reach later times, we stack the denoised supercircuit n times to approximate the evolution up to time nt: In Fig. we stack a denoised t = 1 supercircuit up to n = 20 times and calculate the correlation function, defined in the main text, for the middle site.
We consider Trotter depths M trot = 8, 16, 32, 64 and denoiser depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, for a L = 14 Heisenberg chain with p = 0.01 depolarizing two-qubit noise. The noisy results correspond to M = 0 and the noiseless results to p = 0. In Fig. we calculate the OTOC, defined in the main text, with stacked time evolution for a denoised t = 2 supercircuit with M trot = 32 and M = 2, stacked up to ten times.
We see that the stacked supercircuit performs very well, and the additional precision obtained by using deep denoisers (M = 8) pays off for long evolution times, where we see convergence to the exact result (black dashed lines in Fig. ) as a function of M . FIG. . The two-point z-spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (t) of a spin on the middle site at times 0 and t, for the infinite temperature initial state, for denoised second-order Trotter supercircuits that are optimized at evolution time t = 1 and then stacked up to twenty times.
We use Trotter depths Mtrot = 8, 16, 32, 64 and denoiser depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8. The calculations were performed for a periodic Heisenberg model with L = 14 and PBC, affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with strength p = 0.01, which also affects the denoiser. The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0, and the noiseless results with p = 0.
The panels are arranged as Mtrot = 8, 16, 32, 64 for top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, respectively. The costliest and most noise-susceptible operation is the two-qubit ZZ rotation with angle α, which is the foundation of the unitary piece in our channel parameterization, defined in the main text.
For completeness, we here present the α angles of the optimized denoisers. The results are shown in Fig. , which contains histograms for the channel count N G versus α. The histograms are stacked, with the lightest color corresponding to the angles of the denoiser at t = 0.5 and the darkest at t = 5. The top four panels are for a denoiser with M = 2 and the bottom four with M = 8.
We consider M trot = 8, 16, 32, 64. We see that in both cases the distribution widens upon increasing M trot , indicating that the unitary channels start deviating more from the identity. Moreover, while the M = 2 denoisers in all cases except M trot = 64 have ZZ contributions close to the identity, this is clearly not the case for M = 8.
For simplicity, we did not focus on obtaining denoisers with the smallest sampling overhead γ, which is required to minimize the sign problem and hence ease the sampling of mitigated quantities. Instead, we let the optimization freely choose the η i in the denoiser parameterization, as defined in the main text.
In Fig. we show the sampling overhead of the denoisers from Fig. of the main text. We see that for M = 1 and M = 2 the sampling overhead is relatively small and uniform across the different t, whereas for M > 2 the optimization sometimes yields a denoiser with large γ and other times with small γ. This could be related to the difference in α distributions from Fig. .
The large fluctuations of γ appears to stem from the difficulty in finding optimal deep denoisers, and our optimization procedure likely only finds a local minimum in these cases. Here C(t) is the Trotter supercircuit for time t. In Fig. we show Z dw for the circuits from Fig.",['L = 8 and L = 14.'],5385,multifieldqa_en,en,,e568cc6d77a0a433937ab4bcf62e49b36a5cf7b3faa0d3ab," We consider evolution times t = 0.5, 1,..., 5, for the periodic L = 14 Heisenberg chain that is affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p =0.01.

The different curves correspond to the different supercircuits, i.e. the noisy supercircuit, the denoisers, the corresponding denoised super Circuit, and thenoiseless variant.

The. paper is also available in the online version with the. title Compressed Quantum Error Mitigation for Relativity and Theory Of Relativity. In principle, errors during the execution of a circuit can propagate and accumulate. We introduce a quantum error mitigation technique based on probabilistic error cancellation to eliminate errors which have accumulated during the application of a quantum circuit. Our approach is based on applying an optimal ""denoiser"" after the action of a noisy circuit and can be performed with an arbitrary number of extra gates. For a simple noise model, we show that efficient, local denoisers can be found, and we demonstrate their effectiveness for the digital quantum simulation of the time evolution of simple spin chains. We show that the denoiser allows us to recover the noiseless behavior of a Heisenberg chain that is affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise of strength p = 0.01. We conclude that quantum error correction seems to be more feasible to increase the accuracy of expectation values than the traditional gatewise method from, where noise is mitigated by inverting the noise channel of each gate separately, i.e. the cancellation of errors is performed for each gate on its own. In this Letter, we consider the noise explicitly by treating quantum operations as (generally non-unitary) quantum channels. The noise channel N implements the two-qubit noise. These channels are used to construct a ""supercircuit"" C = N G i=1 Gi, consisting of N G channels. This supercircuit encodes an ensemble of circuits. We call the corresponding ensemble of random circuits a denoiser, and we construct it such that upon averaging the accumulated errors cancel. We illustrate the mitigation procedure in Fig., where adenoiser with one layer is used to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuits with oneLayer. This circuit architecture is commonly used to simulate the time evolution of a quantum many-body system, until some time t, with controllable precision, and we will use it to benchmark the denoisers. We take this into account by imposing the same noise on the denoser as on the noisy circuit. The goal is to construct theDenoiser in a way that averaging over many of its samples cancels the accumulatederrors and gives a good approximation of the noiseless expectation values. We consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and second-order Trotter circuits with depths Mtrot = 16, 32, 64. All gates are affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p = 0.01. We use a trace preserv-ing sum of a unitary and a non-unitary channel. The number of samples required to resolve this cancellation of signs is bounded by Hoeffding's inequality, which is that a sufficient number of states is sufficient to estimate the error at 1.0. The normalized distance between the denoised Trotner supercircuit D C and the noiseless Trotters C (top panels), at evolution times t =0.5, 1,..., 5, and the twopoint z-spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=l/2 (t) of a spin on the middle site at times 0 and t (bottom panels), for the infinite temperature initial state. The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0 and the noniseless values with p= 0, where sgn(η) is the sampled coefficient of the gth channel. Observables are then approximated by resampling the ensemble ensemble. We find that decompositions with γ > 1 are crucial for an accurate denoiser. Restricting to γ = 1 leads to large infidelity and no improvement upon increasing the number of terms in or the depth M of the denoisers. We carry out the minimization of on a classical processor, using gradient descent with the differential programming algorithm from. Instead of explicitly calculating the accumulated global noise channel, we approximate the noiseless supercircuit C with the Denoised supercircuits D C. We consider circuits that are affected by uniform depolarizing noise with probability p for simplicity, but our approach can be used for any non-Clifford noise. The two-qubit noise channel is which acts on neighboring qubits i and i + 1 and is applied to each Trotter and Denoiser gate, and p = 0.01 unless stated otherwise. We study circuits with depths M trot = 16, 32, 64 for evolution times t.5, 1,..., 5, and denoisers D with depth M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8. We see that at M Trot = 64 we can retrieve the no iseless gates already, but that increasing Mtrot = 14 makes this more difficult. At M troT = 64, we are able to mitigate errors to a large extent, but nonetheless we see larger and larger deviations. We have shown that a denoiser with one layer can significantly mitigate errors for second-order Trotter circuits with up to 64 layers. The effectiveness of low-depth compressed circuits for denoising, in contrast with the noiseless time evolution operator compression from Refs., can be understood from the non-unitarity of the denoisers channels. The required number of mitigation gates, i.e. the dimensionality of the corresponding quasiprobability distribution, is tunable and provides control over the sign problem that is inherent to probabilistic error cancellation. We can use e.g. matrix product operators to calculate (4) for some relatively small t, and then stack the final denoised supercircuit on a quantum processor to generate classically intractable states. The normalized distance and its gradient are easily formulated in terms of tensor contractions and singular value decompositions. This provides one route to a practicalDenoiser, which is relevant because the targeted noisless circuit and the accompanying noisy variant need to be simulated classically, confining the optimization procedure to limited system sizes. istance (left) and z spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=L-2 (right), for a second-order Trotter supercircuit of depth Mtrot = 16 for time t = 1, affected by various twoqubit depolarizing errors p. We compare the values obtained with and without a denoiser, i.e. M > 0 and M = 0, to the noiseless values (p = 0). We observe that even for larger noise strength p, the local observable C Zz improves significantly even with denoisers of depth M = 1. For large noise strengths, we generally see that the optimization of the denoisers becomes difficult, leading to nonmonotonic behavior as a function of p. The complexity of an operator can be quantified by its operator entanglement entropy. Here we calculate the half-chain channel entangler entropy S of the noisy C, noisy C, denoising D, and denoised D C supercircuits. We find that the noise destroys the noisy supercircumuit, and that theDenoised S increases for this, such that the denOised S recovers the noise. We optimize the Denoising S to approximate the evolution up to nt = 20 times. We consider Trotter depths M trot = 8, 16, 32, 64 and denoiser depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 for a L = 14 Heisenberg chain with p = 0.01 depolarizing two-qubit noise.

abstract

We present a force feedback controller for a dexterous robotic hand equipped with force sensors on its fingertips. Our controller uses the conditional postural synergies framework to generate the grasp postures, i.e. the finger configuration of the robot, at each time step based on forces measured on the robot's fingertips.
Using this framework we are able to control the hand during different grasp types using only one variable, the grasp size, which we define as the distance between the tip of the thumb and the index finger. Instead of controlling the finger limbs independently, our controller generates control signals for all the hand joints in a (lowdimensional) shared space (i.e.
synergy space). In addition, our approach is modular, which allows to execute various types of precision grips, by changing the synergy space according to the type of grasp. We show that our controller is able to lift objects of various weights and materials, adjust the grasp configuration during changes in the object's weight, and perform object placements and object handovers.

INTRODUCTION

To perform complex manipulation tasks in unstructured environments, humans use tactile feedback from their fingers. This feedback is provided by tactile afferents located in the skin of the hand. Particularly, for handling small objects with precise movements, the afferents located in the fingertips are used, which have high density and adapt fast to pressure changes .
These afferents provide information about the characteristics of the exerted contact forces, such as the magnitude and the direction. For anthropomorphic robots to be able to perform dexterous tasks similar force feedback signals must be used to alleviate problems arising from uncertainty in measurements, and handle external perturbations.
For example, using open-loop position control to lift a heavy object may fail due to slip without any feedback mechanism to provide tactile information. Previous works have used tactile sensors to design force controllers that use slip prediction to update the desired normal forces applied by the fingertips.
The slip predictors are based on machine learning models such as neural networks and random forests to classify multi-modal signals from a tactile sensor. In all previous works, each finger was separately controlled by an independent force controller. In addition, they required labeled data to train the slip predictors and because each finger is controlled independently is not obvious how to implement different anthropomorphic grasp types.
In this work we develop a force controller that takes as input the force readings of the fingertips and computes the grasp size which is then used along with a grasp type label to generate a grasp posture with the desired characteristics. To avoid slippage the desired normal contact force is calculated to be proportional to the tangential contact forces.
The applied normal force is then controlled using the size of the grasp as a control variable. Larger grasp sizes mean less force is applied to the object. So the grasp size is calculated from the error between the desired normal force and the actual measured normal force. The grasp size is then given to the posture sampler that generates a grasp posture, i.e. the finger joint angles.
The posture sampler is modeled with a conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (cVAE) based on the framework proposed in . With this framework we abstract away the low-level control of the fingers and generate hand postures based on high-level properties such as the type and the size of the grasp. So it works as a mapping function that takes as input a low-dimensional vector and the grasp type and size as conditional variables and maps them to a set of joint angles.
We show that with our controller we can control a dexterous robotic hand to lift objects of different weights using three precision grasps. Our controller is also able to compensate and retain a stable grasp during changes in the objects' weight, for example when filling up a cup or emptying it. In addition we show how with the addition of the hand pose information we can use the controller to calculate if the tangential force is due to gravity or due to a support surface and use this information to perform handovers and place down objects on surfaces.
We perform several real-world experiments with a dexterous robotic hand to showcase the capabilities of our controller and support our design choices. To sum up our main contributions are • We develop a controller for a dexterous robotic hand that uses force feedback and the conditional synergies framework to perform dexterous manipulation tasks.
• We show that with our controller we can easily use different precision grasp types, by changing only the grasp type variable which is given to the grasp posture mapping function. • We demonstrate by incorporating information about the world pose of the hand we can use our controller to perform additional tasks such as placing down and handing over objects.
Roboticists have looked for inspiration in humans for developing methods for complex object manipulation . Neuroscientists have studied for a long time the processes that allow humans to use tactile feedback to perform complex manipulation tasks. Humans tend to adjust the grip force according to the object's weight, its friction and they use a safety margin to account for uncertainties .
To gather information about the tactile states they use multiple afferents that are located in the skin of the fingers . There are different afferents in different parts of the hand depending on their usage, e.g. fast adapting afferents in the fingertips for precise manipulation. Based on signals from these afferents, humans encode simple contact events into action phases, such as grasping, lifting or releasing, which they combine in order to perform more complex and long-horizon manipulation tasks .
In robotics tactile sensors have been used for object stabilization and slip prediction in a variety of settings. For example, in , a compliant anthropomorphic prosthetic hand was controlled using force sensing to maintain object stability and avoid slip. In , they develop a control approach that uses integrated force and spatial tactile signals to avoid slip with unknown objects in real world settings.
In , , grasp quality metrics are computed based on the tactile feedback from the robots fingertips. In these works, simple two or three fingered grippers were considered for simple grasping tasks. Force control with anthropomorphic robotic hands has also been explored in more recent works. In , they employ three slip prediction methods to estimate when slip starts and based on the force signals at that moment they calculate the friction coefficient value.
Based on the calculated friction coefficient, they design a force controller that independently controls each finger to achieve a desired normal force. The desired normal contact force is set to be proportional to the tangential contact force and a safety margin based on the evidence found in . In , they train a random forest to classify the contact states into the classes: no contact, contact, slip.
Based on this classification signal, when slip is detected they increase the desired normal contact force to avoid it. In they train a recurrent neural network to estimate slip and the object material from the readings of a Biotac sensor. The force controller is increasing the desired normal contact force when slip is detected.
All these works , , use tactile feedback sensors to predict slip. They collect labeled data, on which they train their models. This approach is based on complex and expensive tactile sensors, and the process of collecting data is cumbersome. In addition, the data do not cover all possible hand poses, which would be impractical.
In contrast, in our work we do not rely on slip prediction, we avoid slip by defining a tangential force gain and a safety margin that work for a large number of objects. Furthermore, instead of independently controlling each finger we use a synergistic framework to generate grasp postures, that is conditioned on two variables: the grasp type and the grasp size.
This way, instead of controlling the values of each joint of each finger, we control only the two conditional variables greatly simplifying the control pipeline. This also, gives us the ability to use different grasp types in our manipulation tasks by changing only the grasp type variable. In also a synergistic framework was used to prevent an object from slipping from a humanoid hand, but they modeled only one synergy for a tripod grasp and they used the forces on the robotic arm as feedback, while we use force feedback from the fingertips.
Our control algorithm could also be applied to different hands as it does not depend on the hands configuration. Finally, in previous approaches only lifting tasks had been considered. In our work we demonstrate that our approach can be used to perform more complex tasks, such as placing objects on surfaces and performing handovers, which was not done in previous works.
Our goal in this work is to design a control algorithm for an anthropomorphic robotic hand to perform dexterous manipulation skills such as lifting and placing down objects. Our control algorithm will use tactile feedback from the force sensors on the fingertips of the hand to decide the forces that need to be applied to the object in each step of the task.
Given the desired forces to be applied, the size of the grasp will be computed. Given the grasp size and a desired grasp type, the posture generator will generate a grasp posture, i.e. the hand configuration, such that the force constraints are satisfied. To model the contacts and friction we use Coulombs' law, which states that in order to avoid slip, the normal contact force f n to the contact surface of an object, times the fiction coefficient µ, has to be larger than the tangential force f t :
µf n ≥ f t You can see an example in Figure , where an object is pressed against a wall by an applied normal force f n , and we have the tangential force f t = mg due to gravity. In order for the object to remain stable we need to apply a normal force: where µ is the friction coefficient between the object and the wall.
In the case of a dexterous hand manipulating an object, we want the normal forces applied by all fingers to be greater than the tangential force divided by the friction coefficient of the materials of the object and the fingertip. Since it is hard to accurately compute the friction coefficient between all possible object materials previous works have used multi-modal tactile sensors like the BioTac sensor, which provides information about the pressure, skin deformation, and temperature, to predict slip and based on that signal to increase the applied normal force.
In our work we use the FTS3 sensors which is a low-cost sensor that measures the 3D force applied in each fingertip. In addition, previous works gathered labeled datasets in order to train their slip prediction models which is time-consuming and limits the possible orientations of the hand, because gathering labeled data for all possible orientations is impractical.
To overcome this we experimentally selected the parameters that determine the value of the applied normal force such that we avoid slip for all objects in our dataset, from the lightest to the heaviest. In order to guarantee contact between the fingertip and the object, in the beginning of the grasping phase, we use an offset f of f set n as the minimum normal force applied by each finger.
In they also suggest that humans use an additional safety margin which is proportional to the tangential force, f margin n ∝ f t . So the final desired normal contact force becomes: where G is the gain that includes the friction coefficient and the additional safety margin. To alleviate the effects of noise in the sensors, the running average of the measured normal force f n and tangential force f t is used, as a low pass filter.
So for each force measurement we have the following relation: where α ∈ (0, 1) is a parameter that determines how much new measurements affect the value, and is experimentally selected. Given the measured normal force f n from the fingertip sensors we can compute the error f err n = f des n − f n . We use this error signal to control the grasp size variable g size , that we use as a conditional variable in our posture mapping function.
The grasp size represents the distance between the thumb and the index finger in a grasp posture. So a smaller grasp size will result in a tighter grasp and greater normal force applied to the surface of the object. We use a linear controller for the grasp size variable that is implemented as follows: where K is a parameter that controls the rate of decrease of the grasp size, and is experimentally selected.
So when the error between the desired normal force and the actual normal force is large the grasp size decreases so tighter grasp postures are generated in order to apply more normal force. In practice, in order to avoid oscillations in the grasp size we use the desired normal force as a high threshold that we want the measured normal force to be below:
If the normal force is below that threshold the grasp size does not change even if there are small oscillations in the measured tangential and normal forces. Also, in order to avoid the hand applying too much force that damages the hardware or the object we use a low threshold, that is: where w threshold is the width of the threshold in mN .
If the measured normal force is below the grasp size increases in order to apply less force. So the final grasp size variable for grasping is calculated as follows: where This is similar to the deadband control method , where instead of having a fixed reference point, an operating range is set. If the response is in this range, the controller does not exert any correction.
In our case, the operating range changes according to the force signals from the robot's fingertips. The grasp posture mapping function is based on the conditional postural synergies model presented in . It uses a conditional Variational Auto-Encoder model to generate grasps postures conditioned on additional variables such as the grasp size.
In this work we augment this model to also generate grasp postures conditioned on the grasp type. The model is trained on a set of labeled grasp samples acquired by teleoperating a robotic hand using a data-glove. Using this model we are able to abstract away the low-level control of each joint of each finger and generate grasps based on more general characteristics such as the type and the size of the grasp.
In this way we can control all the fingers jointly by a single value, the grasp size, thus greatly reducing the control parameters. In addition we are able to use the same control algorithm for different precision grasp types, by changing the grasp type conditional variable. Finally, we can modify our controller to release objects instead of grasping them.
Given the pose of the hand in the world coordinate frame, which we can acquire from the robotic arm that is attached to, we can use the forward kinematics of the hand to compute the poses of each fingertip. Then using the force readings of each fingertip we can calculate the global direction of the net tangential force.
If the angle between the direction of the net tangential force and the direction of gravity is less than 90 degrees, i.e. the net tangential force's direction is towards the ground, we assume that the tangential force is due to gravity pulling the object, so the force controller tries to grasp it. If the angle is more than 90 degrees, i.e. the net tangential force's direction is upward, it means that something is pushing (or pulling) the object upward, in which case we assume that the object is touching on a support surface or someone is pulling the object so the controller increases the grasp size given to the posture mapping function proportionally to the normal force measured thus slowly releasing the object.
Opening the grasp is done by controlling the grasp size variable as follows: That way we can place objects on surfaces but also perform robot to human handovers, where the robot holds the object and the human grasps the object and slightly pushes or pulls it up, signaling to the robot that there is a support surface.
The robot then slowly releases the object by opening its grasp. We showcase these scenarios in the experiments' section. Based on these observations, we present our force controller in Figure . The hand starts in an open pre-grasp position, a latent point is sampled from the prior distribution of the posture mapping function, and given the desired grasp type and the grasp size a grasp posture, i.e. the joint angles of the fingers, is sampled.
The initial grasp size is set to the maximum value, and when the force controller comes into effect and depending on the state of the system and the forces on the fingertips grasp size changes by some value C, according to equations 1,2, until the desired normal force is achieved. To choose between grasping or releasing an object we use a finite state machine formulation.
When the hand reaches the desired grasp pose, which we assume is provided, the GRASP state is activated, in which the controller tries to grasp the object. When the controller detects that the tangential force applied to the object is coming from a support surface the state changes to the RELEASE state, in which the controller releases the object by opening the grasp.
You can see the full algorithm in Python-like pseudocode in Figure . To summarize, the advantages of our controller compared with previous approaches are threefold: 1) instead of controlling each joint of each finger of the hand we use only two variables, the grasp size and the grasp type, which allows us to perform multiple grasp types by changing only one variable while the grasp size variable is common among all grasp types, that greatly reduces the complexity of the control process compared to independently controlling a 21 DoF hand to perform different grasp types, 2) we do not rely on slip prediction for controlling the desired normal force, which involves gathering labeled data and works only for the hand poses in the training dataset, and 3) we can use our controller to also release objects instead of only grasping them.

Experimental Set-up.

For our experiments we used the Seed Robotics RH8D Hand , which is a robotic hand with 7 DoFs. The hand is equipped with the FTS-3 force sensors in each fingertip, which are high resolution tactile sensors that provide the 3D force applied in each fingertip. The sensor provides data at a rate of 50Hz. For the experiments the hand was mounted on a Kinova Gen3 7DoF robot.
To train the posture mapping function we used the CyberGlove to teleoperate the hand and collect 468 grasps belonging to three precision grasp  types: tripod, pinch, lateral tripod. The architecture of the cVAE model was the same as in , with the addition of the grasp type as a conditional variable, which was one-hot encoded.
We used 10 household objects shown in Figure . With the heaviest object weighing 380g and the lightest 1g. During the experiments the trajectories of the arm were prerecorded, while the hand was controlled online by our control algorithm.

Parameter tuning.

To select the values of the parameters in our controllers we conducted preliminary experiments where we tested lifting and releasing several objects, with different physical properties. To select the value of the normal offset force f of f set n , we used an empty plastic cup as our test object, and we choose a value such that the fingers do not deform the cup.
The final value of the parameter was set to -50 mN. To select the values of the gain G and the rate of decrease K, of the grasp size, we experimented with the heaviest object in our dataset, which is the mustard bottle and weighs 380g. The gain G was set to 2.0 such that the desired normal force would be enough to hold the object.
The rate of change of the grasp size was set to 100.0, based on the operating frequency of the force sensor and the range of values of the tangential force. For the tangential force averaging process we used a parameter value of α t = 0.7, because we want the controller to be sensitive to fast changes in its value, that can arise for example during lifting an object.
For the normal force averaging process we used a parameter value of α n = 0.5, as we do not want it to be affected by noise that could make the controller overconfident.

Experiments.

To explore the capabilities of our controller, we demonstrate five experiments of increasing complexity: 1) we picked and placed a bottle using a tripod grasp, 2) we picked, rotated and placed a chips can on a box using a tripod grasp, 3) we picked, rotated and handed over the chips can to a person using a tripod grasp, 4) we picked, rotated and handed over a brown foam brick to a person using a pinch grasp, 5) a person handed over a plastic cup to the robot, filled it with coins to increase its weight, and the robot then handed it back to the person using a tripod grasp.
You can see the execution of the first experiment in  In the middle row, for our third experiment, the robot picks up the chips can, rotates it 90 degrees, and hands it over to a person. In the bottom row, for our forth experiment, the robot picks up a foam brick, rotates it 180 degrees, and hands it over to a person, using a pinch grasp.
Fig. . In our fifth experiment, a person hands over an empty plastic cup to the robot, throws coins in it to increase its weight while the robot adjusts its grip to stabilize the object, and then hand overs the cup back to the person. force is below the offset f of f set n , 2) (green part) the robot lifts the object, as it tries to lift the tangential force increases, increasing the threshold, so the grasp size decreases to apply more normal force, 3) (orange part) the robot transports the object, you can see, in point A in the Figure, a perturbation in the tangential force when the robot begins to move, the controller responds by decreasing the grasp thus stabilizing the object, and 4) (blue part) the robot enters the releasing phase, where it lowers the arm until it detects that the tangential force is due to a support surface, then it stops lowering the arm and increases the grasp size slowly releasing the object.
In point B in the Figure, you can see that there is noise in the tangential force, due to the arm moving to place the object on the table, that is also reflected in the desired normal force. Because we use the desired normal force as a threshold and not as a reference signal this noise is not manifested in the control of the grasp size.
You can see the execution of the second experiment in the upper part of Figure . This experiment demonstrates the ability of the controller to handle arbitrary hand poses. The experiment is divided in four parts: 1) the robot enters the GRASP phase and the force controller generates grasps to achieve a normal contact force below the f of f set n threshold, 2) the robot lifts the object and adjusts the grasp size to avoid the object falling, 3) the hand rotates to place the chips can on the horizontal position, and 4) the robot enters the RELEASE phase, and the arm lowers until the object touches the box, when the hand detects the supporting surface, it starts to slowly release the object.
You can see the execution of the third experiment in the middle part of Figure . This experiment demonstrates the ability of the controller to perform robot to human handovers. The experiment is divided in four parts: 1) the robot enters the GRASP phase and the force controller generates grasps to achieve a normal contact force below the f of f set n threshold, 2) the robot lifts the object and adjusts the grasp size to avoid the object falling, 3) the hand rotates to place the chips can on the vertical position, and 4) the robot enters the RELEASE phase, the arm stays still, the human grasps the object from the bottom and slightly pushes it up, the hand then detects that there is a supporting surface and starts to slowly release the object.
You can see the execution of the fourth experiment in the bottom part of Figure . This experiment is similar to previous one, but the grasp type that the robot uses is a pinch grasp, that involves only the thumb and the index finger. To perform this we only had to alter the grasp type conditional variable that was given to the posture mapping function.
You can see the execution of the fifth experiment in the bottom part of Figure . In the first part (blue) of the experiment the robot closes its grasp, by reducing the grasp size, until the normal force is below the force offset. In the next three parts (pink, green, red) the person throws coins in the cup to increase its weight.
You can see in the signal plots that each time coins are added the tangential force decreases so the normal force threshold decreases too. The grasp sizes then decreases as well in order to apply more normal force. This experiment demonstrates the ability of the controller to handle perturbations in the weight of the object during grasping.

CONCLUSION

In summary, we presented a controller that uses force feedback integrated with conditional synergies to control a dexterous robotic hand to grasp and release objects. We demonstrated that our controller can lift objects of different weights and materials while avoiding slip, react online when the weight of the object changes, place them down on surfaces, and hand them over to humans.
In addition, the control architecture is modular, so the synergy grasp mapping component can be easily changed in order to control several precision grasp types. However, our experiments also revealed various limitations of our controller. For example our method fails to stabilize the object when rotational slip occurs.
In addition hardware limitations such as, slow update rates and noise in the force measurements can create problems that result in the object falling. In future work we plan to incorporate additional sensing modalities, such as vision to alleviate some of these issues.",['5.'],4837,multifieldqa_en,en,,daa4eb9d8b28a987b1c2c049200634cdc510636b19a64ccd," Title: Force Feedback Control For Dexterous Robotic Hands Using Conditional Postural SynergiesPublish Date: Unkown.Author List: Dimitrios Dimou, José Santos-Victor, Plinio Moreno.

Figure 6: The average normal force applied by all fingers (blue line), the thresholds f threshold high n (purple dashed line) and f threshold low n (yellow dashed line), and the grasp size used in each time-step (red). The task is divided four stages: 1) (red part) the initial grasp of the object, in this stage the force controller closes the grasp until the applied normal force is 0.5. In the bottom row, for our forth experiment, the robot picks up a foam brick, rotates it 180 degrees, and hands it over to a person, using a pinch grasp. The force controller takes as input the force readings of the fingertips and computes the grasp size. To avoid slippage the desired normal contact force is calculated to be proportional to the tangential contact forces. The applied normal force is then controlled using the size of the grasp as a control variable. Larger grasp sizes mean less force is applied to the object. The grasp size is then given to the posture sampler that generates a grasp posture, i.e. the finger joint angles. We show that with our controller we can control a dexterous robotic hand to lift objects of different weights using three precision grasps. Our controller is also able to compensate and retain a stable grasp during changes in the objects' weight, for example when filling up a cup or emptying it. In addition we show how with the addition of the hand pose information we can use the controller to calculate if the Tangential force is due to gravity or due to a support surface and use this information to perform handovers and place down objects. In previous works only lifting tasks had been considered. In our work we demonstrate that our approach can be used to perform more complex tasks, such as placing objects on surfaces and performing handovers, which was not done in previous works. Our control algorithm will use tactile feedback from the force sensors on the fingertips of the hand to decide the forces that need to be applied to the object in each step of the task. We avoid slip by defining a tangential force gain and a safety margin that work for a large number of objects. We use a synergistic framework to generate grasp postures, that is conditioned on two variables: the grasp type and the grasp size. We control only the two conditional variables greatly simplifying the control pipeline.Our control algorithm could also be applications to different hands as it does not depend on the hands configuration. It could be used for dexterous manipulation skills such as lifting and placing down objects. For more information on the project visit: http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/29/science/science-technology/features/force-control-with-anthropomorphic-robot-hand.html. Force f t = mg due to gravity. In order for the object to remain stable we need to apply a normal force. Previous works have used multi-modal tactile sensors like the BioTac sensor, which provides information about the pressure, skin deformation, and temperature, to predict slip and based on that signal to increase the appliednormal force. In our work we use the FTS3 sensors which is a low-cost sensor that measures the 3D force applied in each fingertip. We use this error signal to control the grasp size variable g size, that we use as a conditional variable in our posture mapping function. The grasp posture mapping func func is implemented as follows: where K is a parameter that controls the rate of decrease of the grasp sizes, and is experimentally selected. If the measured normal force is below the grasped size increases in order to apply less force. This is similar to the deadband control method, where instead of having a fixed reference point, an operating range is set. The operating range changes according to the force signals from the robot's fingertips. ion is based on the conditional postural synergies model presented in. It uses a conditional Variational Auto-Encoder model to generate grasps postures conditioned on additional variables such as the grasp size. The model is trained on a set of labeled grasp samples acquired by teleoperating a robotic hand using a data-glove. Using this model we are able to abstract away the low-level control of each joint of each finger and generate gr asps based on more general characteristics such as type and the size of the grasp. Finally, we can modify our controller to release objects instead of grasping them. The hand starts in an open pre-grasp position, a latent point is sampled from the prior distribution of the posture mapping function, and given the desired grasp type and grasp size a grasp posture is sampled. The initial grasp size is set to the maximum value, and when the force controller comes into effect and depending on the state of the system and the forces on the fingertips grasp size changes by some value C, according to equations 1,2. plexity of the control process compared to independently controlling a 21 DoF hand to perform different grasp types. We do not rely on slip prediction for controlling the desired normal force, which involves gathering labeled data and works only for the hand poses in the training dataset. We can use our controller to also release objects instead of only grasping them. We used 10 household objects shown in Figure. With the heaviest object weighing 380g and the lightest 1g. During the experiments the trajectories of the arm were prerecorded, while the hand was controlled online by our control algorithm. The architecture of the cVAE model was the same as in, with the addition of the grasp type as a conditional variable, which was one-hot encoded. The final value of the parameter was set to -50 mN. To select the values of the parameters in our controllers we conducted preliminary experiments where we tested lifting and releasing several objects, with different physical properties. For the experiments we used the Seed Robotics RH8D Hand, which is a robotic hand with 7 DoFs. The hand was mounted on a Kinova Gen3 7DoF robot. The experiment is divided in four parts: 1) the robot enters the GRASP phase and the force controller generates grasps to achieve a normal contact force below the f of f set n threshold. 2) The robot lifts the object and adjusts the grasp size to avoid the object falling, 3) the hand rotates to place the chips can on the horizontal position, and 4) the arm lowers until the object touches the box, when the hand detects the supporting surface, it starts to slowly release the object. The controller can also react online when the weight of the object changes, place them down on surfaces, and hand them over to humans. The control architecture is modular, so the synergy grasp mapping component can be easily changed in order to control several precision grasp types. However, our experiments also revealed various limitations of our controller.

abstract

CG:SHOP is an annual geometric optimization challenge and the 2022 edition proposed the problem of coloring a certain geometric graph defined by line segments. Surprisingly, the top three teams used the same technique, called conflict optimization. This technique has been introduced in the 2021 edition of the challenge, to solve a coordinated motion planning problem.
In this paper, we present the technique in the more general framework of binary constraint satisfaction problems (binary CSP). Then, the top three teams describe their different implementations of the same underlying strategy. We evaluate the performance of those implementations to vertex color not only geometric graphs, but also other types of graphs.

Introduction

The CG:SHOP challenge (Computational Geometry: Solving Hard Optimization Problems) is an annual geometric optimization competition, whose first edition took place in 2019. The 2022 edition proposed a problem called minimum partition into plane subgraphs. The input is a graph G embedded in the plane with edges drawn as straight line segments, and the goal is to partition the set of edges into a small number of plane graphs (Fig. ) .
This goal can be formulated as a vertex coloring problem on a graph G defined as follows. The vertices of G are the segments defining the edges of G, and the edges of G correspond to pairs of crossing segments (segments that intersect only at a common endpoint are not considered crossing). The three top-ranking teams (Lasa, Gitastrophe, and Shadoks) on the CG:SHOP 2022 challenge all used a common approach called conflict optimization while the fourth team used a SAT-Boosted Tabu Search .
Conflict optimization is a technique used by Shadoks to obtain the first place in the CG:SHOP 2021 challenge for low-makespan coordinated motion planning , and the main ideas of the technique lent themselves well to the 2022 challenge. Next, we describe the conflict optimizer as a metaheuristic to solve constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) .
We start by describing a CSP. A CSP is a triple of • variables X = (x 1 , . . . , x n ), Each of the 57 colors is then presented in small figures. • domains D = (D 1 , . . . , D n ), and • constraints R. Each variable x i must be assigned a value in the corresponding domain D i such that all constraints are satisfied.
In general, the constraints may forbid arbitrary subsets of values. We restrict our attention to a particular type of constraints (binary CSP ), which only involve pairs of assignments. A partial evaluation is an assignment of a subset of the variables, called evaluated, with the remaining variables called non-evaluated.
All constraints involving a non-evaluated variable are satisfied by default. We only consider assignments and partial assignments that satisfy all constraints. The conflict optimizer iteratively modifies a partial evaluation with the goal of emptying the set S of non-evaluated variables, at which point it stops.
At each step, a variable x i is removed from S. If there exists a value x ∈ D i that satisfies all constraints, then we assign the value x to the variable x i . Otherwise, we proceed as follows. For each possible value x ∈ D i , we consider the set K(i, x) of variables (other than x i ) that are part of constraints violated by the assignment x i = x.
We assign to x i the value x that minimizes where w(j) is a weight function to be described later. The variables x j ∈ K(i, x) become non-evaluated and added to S. The weight function should be such that w(j) increases each time x j is added to S, in order to avoid loops that keep moving the same variables back and forth from S. Let q(j) be the number of times x j became non-evaluated.
A possible weight function is w(j) = q(j). More generally, we can have w(j) = q(j) p for some exponent p (typically between 1 and 2). Of course, several details of the conflict optimizer are left open. For example, which element to choose from S, whether some random noise should be added to w, and the decision to restart the procedure from scratch after a certain time.
The CSP as is, does not apply to optimization problems. However, we can, impose a maximum value k of the objective function in order to obtain a CSP. The conflict optimizer was introduced in a low makespan coordinated motion planning setting. In that setting, the variables are the robots, the domains are their paths (of length at most k) and the constraints forbid collisions between two paths.
In the graph coloring setting, the domains are the k colors of the vertices and the constraints forbid adjacent vertices from having the same color. The conflict optimizer can be adapted to non-binary CSP, but in that case multiple variables may be unassigned for a single violated constraint. The strategy has some resemblance to the similarly named min-conflicts algorithm , but notable differences are that a partial evaluation is kept instead of an invalid evaluation and the weight function that changes over time.
While the conflict optimization strategy is simple, there are different ways to apply it to the graph coloring problem. The goal of the paper is to present how the top three teams applied it or complemented it with additional strategies. We compare the relative benefits of each variant on the instances given in the CG:SHOP 2022 challenge.
We also compare them to baselines on some instances issued from graph coloring benchmarks. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the details of the conflict optimization strategy applied to graph coloring. In the three sections that follow, the three teams Lasa, Gitastrophe, and Shadoks present the different parameters and modified strategies that they used to make the algorithm more efficient for the CG:SHOP 2022 challenge.
The last section is devoted to the experimental results.

Literature Review

The study of graph coloring goes back to the 4-color problem (1852) and it has been intensively studied since the 1970s (see for surveys). Many heuristics have been proposed , as well as exact algorithms . We briefly present two classes of algorithms: greedy algorithms and exact algorithms. Greedy algorithms.
These algorithms are used to find good quality initial solutions in a short amount of time. The classic greedy heuristic considers the vertices in arbitrary order and colors each vertex with the smallest non-conflicting color. The two most famous modern greedy heuristics are DSATUR and Recursive Largest First (RLF ) .
At each step (until all vertices are colored), DSATUR selects the vertex v that has the largest number of different colors in its neighbourhood. Ties are broken by selecting a vertex with maximum degree. The vertex v is colored with the smallest non-conflicting color. RLF searches for a large independent set I, assigns the vertices I the same color, removes I from G , and repeats until all vertices are colored.
Exact algorithms. Some exact methods use a branch-and-bound strategy, for example extending the DSATUR heuristic by allowing it to backtrack . Another type of exact method (branch-and-cut-and-price) decomposes the vertex coloring problem into an iterative resolution of two sub-problems . The ""master problem"" maintains a small set of valid colors using a set-covering formulation.
The ""pricing problem"" finds a new valid coloring that is promising by solving a maximum weight independent set problem. Exact algorithms are usually able to find the optimal coloring for graphs with a few hundred vertices. However, even the smallest CG:SHOP 2022 competition instances involve at least a few thousands vertices.

Conflict Optimization for Graph Coloring

Henceforth, we will only refer to the intersection conflict graph G induced by the instance. Vertices will refer to the vertices V (G ), and edges will refer to the edges E(G ). Our goal is to partition the vertices using a minimum set of k color classes C = {C 1 , . . . , C k }, where no two vertices in the same color class C i are incident to a common edge.

Conflict Optimization

TABUCOL inspired neighbourhood One classical approach for the vertex coloring involves allowing solutions with conflicting vertices (two adjacent vertices with the same color). It was introduced in 1987 and called TABUCOL. It starts with an initial solution, removes a color (usually the one with the least number of vertices), and assigns uncolored vertices with a new color among the remaining ones.
This is likely to lead to some conflicts (i.e. two adjacent vertices sharing a same color). The local search scheme selects a conflicting vertex, and tries to swap its color, choosing the new coloring that minimises the number of conflicts. If it reaches a state with no conflict, it provides a solution with one color less than the initial solution.
The process is repeated until the stopping criterion is met. While the original TABUCOL algorithm includes a ""tabu-list"" mechanism to avoid cycling, it is not always sufficient, and requires some hyper-parameter tuning in order to obtain a good performance on a large variety of instances. To overcome this issue, we use a neighbourhood, but replace the ""tabu-list"" by the conflict optimizer scheme presented above.
PARTIALCOL inspired neighbourhood PARTIALCOL another local search algorithm solving the vertex coloring problem was introduced in 2008. This algorithm proposes a new local search scheme that allows partial coloring (thus allowing uncolored vertices). The goal is to minimize the number of uncolored vertices.
Similarly to TABUCOL, PARTIALCOL starts with an initial solution, removes one color (unassigning its vertices), and performs local search iterations until no vertex is left uncolored. When coloring a vertex, the adjacent conflicting vertices are uncolored. Then, the algorithm repeats the process until all vertices are colored, or the stopping criterion is met.
This neighbourhood was also introduced alongside a tabu-search procedure. The tabu-search scheme is also replaced by a conflict-optimization scheme. Note that this neighbourhood was predominantly used by the other teams.

Finding Initial Solutions

Lasa team used two approaches to find initial solutions: 1. DSATUR is the classical graph coloring algorithm presented in Section 1. 2. Orientation greedy is almost the only algorithm where the geometry of the segments is used. If segments are almost parallel, it is likely that they do not intersect (thus forming an independent set).
This greedy algorithm first sorts the segments by orientation, ranging from − π 2 to π 2 . For each segment in this order, the algorithm tries to color it using the first available color. If no color has been found, a new color is created for coloring the considered segment. This algorithm is efficient, produces interesting initial solutions and takes into account the specificities of the competition.

Solution Initialization

The gitastrophe team uses the traditional greedy algorithm of Welsh and Powell to obtain initial solutions: order the vertices in decreasing order of degree, and assign each vertex the minimum-label color not used by its neighbors. During the challenge Gitastrophe attempted to use different orderings for the greedy algorithm, such as sorting by the slope of the line segment associated with each vertex (as the orientation greedy initialization presented in Section 3), and also tried numerous other strategies.
Ultimately, after running the solution optimizer for approximately the same amount of time, all initializations resulted in an equal number of colors.

Modifications to the Conflict Optimizer

Taking inspiration from memetic algorithms, which alternate between an intensification and a diversification stage, the algorithm continually switched between a phase using the above conflict score, and one minimizing only the number of conflicts. Thus during the conflict-minimization phase, the random variables f (C j ) and w(u) are both fixed equal to 1 leading to a conflict score
Each phase lasted for 10 5 iterations. Adding the conflict-minimization phase gave minor improvements to some of the challenge instances.

Shadoks

In this section, we describe the choices used by the Shadoks team for the options described in Section 2.1. The Shadoks generally chose to eliminate the color with the smallest number of elements. However, if the multistart option is toggled on, then a random color is used each time. The conflict set S is stored in a queue.
The Shadoks tried other strategies, but found that the queue gives the best results. The weight function used is w(u) = 1 + q(u) p , mostly with p = 1.2. The effect of the parameter p is shown in Fig. . Notice that in all figures, the number of colors shown is the average of ten executions of the code using different random seeds.
The algorithm uses σ = 0.15, easy vertices, q max = 59022, but does not use the BDFS nor any clique. If q(u) is larger than a threshold q max , the Shadoks set w(u) = ∞ so that the vertex u never reenters S. If at some point an uncolored vertex v is adjacent to some vertex u of infinite weight in every color class, then the conflict optimizer is restarted.
When restarting, the initial coloring is shuffled by moving some vertices from their initial color class to a new one. Looking at Fig. , the value of q max does not seem to have much influence as long as it is not too small. Throughout the challenge the Shadoks almost exclusively used q max = 2000 • (75000/m) 2 , where m is the number of vertices.
This value roughly ensures a restart every few hours. q max =0.5k q max =5k q max =50k q max =100k q max =250k The Shadoks use the function f as a Gaussian random variable of mean 1 and variance σ. A good default value is σ = 0.15. The effect of the variance is shown in Fig. . Notice that setting σ = 0 gives much worse results.
Option (e) The goal of BDFS is to further optimize very good solutions that the conflict optimizer is not able to improve otherwise. Fig. shows the influence of BDFS. While on this figure, the advantages of BDFS cannot be noticed, its use near the end of the challenge improved about 30 solutions. The bounded depth-first search (BDFS) algorithm tries to improve the dequeuing process.
The goal is to prevent a vertex in conflict with some adjacent colored vertices from entering in the conflict set. At the first level, the algorithm searches for a recoloring of some adjacent vertices which allows us to directly recolor the conflict vertex. If no solution is found, the algorithm  In both figures the algorithm uses p = 1.2, easy vertices, q max = 59022, but does not use the BDFS nor any clique.
For σ ≥ 0.25, no solution better than 248 colors is found. could recolor some vertices at larger distances from the conflict vertex. To do so, a local search is performed by trying to recolor vertices at a bounded distance from the conflict vertex in the current partial solution. The BDFS algorithm has two parameters: adjacency bound a max and depth d.
In order to recolor a vertex v, BDFS gets the set C of color classes with at most a max neighbors of v. If a class in C has no neighbor of v, v is assigned to C. Otherwise, for each class C ∈ C, BDFS tries to recolor the vertices in C which are adjacent to v by recursively calling itself with depth d − 1.
At depth d = 0 the algorithm stops trying to color the vertices. During the challenge the Shadoks used BDFS with parameters a max = 3 and d = 3. The depth was increased to 5 (resp. 7) when the number of vertices in the queue was 2 (resp. 1). Degeneracy order Given a target number of colors k, we call easy vertices a set of vertices Y such that, if the remainder of the vertices of G are colored using k colors, then we are guaranteed to be able to color all vertices of G with k colors.
This is obtained using the degeneracy order Y . To obtain Y we iteratively remove from the graph a vertex v that has at most k − 1 neighbors, appending v to the end of Y . We repeat until no other vertex can be added to Y . Notice that, once we color the remainder of the graph with at least k colors, we can use a greedy coloring for Y in order from last to first without increasing the number of colors used.
Removing the easy vertices reduces the total number of vertices, making the conflict optimizer more effective. The Shadoks always toggle this option on (the challenge instances contain from 0 to 23% easy vertices).

Results

We provide the results of the experiments performed with the code from the three teams on two classes of instances. First, we present the results on some selected CG:SHOP 2022 instances. These instances are intersection graphs of line segments. Second, we execute the code on graphs that are not intersection graphs, namely the classic DIMACS graphs , comparing the results of our conflict optimizer implementations to previous solutions.
The source code for the three teams is available at: • Lasa: https://github.com/librallu/dogs-color • Gitastrophe: https://github.com/jacketsj/cgshop2022-gitastrophe • Shadoks: https://github.com/gfonsecabr/shadoks-CGSHOP2022

CG:SHOP 2022 Instances

We selected 14 instances (out of 225) covering the different types of instances given in the CG:SHOP 2022 challenge. The results are presented in Table . For comparison, we executed the HEAD code on some instances using the default parameters. The table shows the smallest number of colors for which HEAD found a solution.
We ran HEAD for 1 hour of repetitions for each target number of colors on a single CPU core (the HEAD solver takes the target number of colors as a parameter and we increased this parameter one by one). At the end of the challenge, 8 colorings computed by Lasa, 11 colorings computed by Gitastrophe, and 23 colorings computed by Shadoks over 225 instances have been proved optimal (their number of colors is equal to the size of a clique).
In order to compare the efficiency of the algorithms, we executed the different implementations on the CG:SHOP instance vispecn13806. The edge density of this graph is 19%, the largest clique that we found has 177 vertices and the best coloring found during the challenge uses 218 colors. Notice that vispecn13806 is the same instance used in other Shadoks experiments in Section 5. Notice also that HEAD algorithm provides 283 colors after one hour compared to less than 240 colors for the conflict optimizers.
We ran the three implementations on three different servers and compared the results shown in Figure . For each implementation, the x coordinate is the running time in hours, while the y coordinate is the smallest number of colors found at that time.

Results on DIMACS Graphs

We tested the implementation of each team on the DIMACS instances to gauge the performance of the conflict optimizer on other classes of graphs. We compared our results to the best known bounds and to the state of the art coloring algorithms HEAD and QACOL . The time limit for Lasa's algorithms is 1 hour.
CWLS is Lasa's conflict optimizer with the neighbourhood presented in TABUCOL , while PWLS is the optimizer with the neighbourhood presented in PARTIALCOL . Gitastrophe algorithm ran 10 minutes after which the number of colors no longer decreases. Shadoks algorithm ran for 1 hour without the BDFS option (results with BDFS are worse).
Results are presented in Table . We only kept the difficult DIMACS instances. For the other instances, all the results match the best known bounds. The DIMACS instances had comparatively few edges (on the order of thousands or millions); the largest intersection graphs considered in the CG:SHOP challenge had over 1.5 billion edges.
We notice that the conflict optimizer works extremely poorly on random graphs, but it is fast and appears to perform well on geometric graphs (r250.5, r1000.1c, r1000.5, dsjr500.1c and dsjr500.5), matching the best-known results . Interestingly, these geometric graphs are not intersection graphs as in the CG:SHOP challenge, but are generated based on a distance threshold.
On the DIMACS graphs, Lasa implementation shows better performance than the other implementations.","['Lasa, Gitastrophe, and Shadoks.']",3791,multifieldqa_en,en,,191c14b84f0c8cdad3297f2bee552fb089178995208d7185," The conflict optimizer underperforms except on the geometric graphs r* and dsjr*.CE39-0007.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the details of the conflict optimization strategy applied to graph coloring. In the three sections that follow, the three teams present the various strategies they used. The last section is devoted to the experimental results for the conflict optimizer scheme. The study of graph coloring goes back to the 4-color problem (1852) and it has been intensively studied since the 1970s (see for surveys). Many heuristics have been proposed, as well as exact algorithms. We briefly present two classes of algorithms: greedy algorithms and exact algorithms. The classic greedy heuristic considers the vertices in arbitrary order and colors each vertices with the smallest non-conflicting color. The two most famous modern exact methods use a branch-and-bound strategy, for example extending the DSATUR heuristic by allowing it to backtrack. The ""pricing problem"" finds a new valid coloring by solving a maximum weight independent set problem. algorithm proposes a new local search scheme that allows partial coloring. The goal is to minimize the number of uncolored vertices. The Shadoks generally chose to eliminate the color with the smallest number of elements. If the multistart option is toggled on, then a random color is used each time. The conflict set S is stored in a queue. The weight function used is w(u) = 1 + q(u), mostly with p = 1.2. The algorithm uses σ = 0.15, easy vertices, q max = 59022, but does not use the BDFS nor any clique. Looking at Fig., the value of q max does not seem to have much much much influence a much much more powerful algorithm than the one used by the Shadoks team in this study. The results of this study are published in the open-source version of the code. The code is available for download from the GitHub repository here: http://www.jupiter.com/jupiter-competition. B bounded depth-first search (BDFS) algorithm tries to improve the dequeuing process. BDFS is to further optimize very good solutions that the conflict optimizer is not able to improve otherwise. Shadoks almost exclusively used q max = 2000 • (75000/m) 2, where m is the number of vertices. The Shadoks use the function f as a Gaussian random variable of mean 1 and variance σ. For σ ≥ 0.25, no solution better than 248 colors is found. The source code for the three teams is available at: Lasa: https://www.cgshop.com/dogs-color • Gitastrophe:https://github.j/202222-librets- CG:SHOP 2022 Instances (out of 225) The results are presented in Table. For comparison, we executed the HEAD code on some instances using the default parameame parame. The results of the experiments performed with the code from three teams on two classes of instances. These instances are intersection graphs of line segments. Second, we execute the code on graphs that are not intersection graphs, namely the classic DIMACS graphs, comparing the results of our conflict optimizers to previous solutions. We ran HEAD for 1 hour of repetitions for each target number of colors on a single CPU core. At the end of the challenge, 8 colorings. computed by Lasa, 11 colorings computed by Gitastrophe, and 23. coloring computed by Shadoks over 225 instances have been proved optimal. The largest clique that we found has 177 vertices and the best coloring found during the challenge uses 218 colors. The conflict optimizer works extremely poorly on random graphs, but it is fast and appears to perform well on geometric graphs (r250, r1000.5, dsjr500.1c and dsJr 500.5), matching the best-known results. The DIMACS instances had comparatively few edges (on the order of thousands or millions)"

abstract

The evolutionary balance between innate and learned behaviors is highly intricate, and different organisms have found different solutions to this problem. We hypothesize that the emergence and exact form of learning behaviors is naturally connected with the statistics of environmental fluctuations and tasks an organism needs to solve.
Here, we study how different aspects of simulated environments shape an evolved synaptic plasticity rule in static and moving artificial agents. We demonstrate that environmental fluctuation and uncertainty control the reliance of artificial organisms on plasticity. Interestingly, the form of the emerging plasticity rule is additionally determined by the details of the task the artificial organisms are aiming to solve.
Moreover, we show that coevolution between static connectivity and interacting plasticity mechanisms in distinct sub-networks changes the function and form of the emerging plasticity rules in embodied agents performing a foraging task. One of the defining features of living organisms is their ability to adapt to their environment and incorporate new information to modify their behavior.
It is unclear how the ability to learn first evolved , but its utility appears evident. Natural environments are too complex for all the necessary information to be hardcoded genetically and more importantly, they keep changing during an organism's lifetime in ways that cannot be anticipated ; . The link between learning and environmental uncertainty and fluctuation has been extensively demonstrated in both natural ; , and artificial environments .
Nevertheless, the ability to learn does not come without costs. For the capacity to learn to be beneficial in evolutionary terms, a costly nurturing period is often required, a phenomenon observed in both biological , and artificial organisms . Additionally, it has been shown that in some complex environments, hardcoded behaviors may be superior to learned ones given limits in the agent's lifetime and envi-ronmental uncertainty ; ; .
The theoretical investigation of the optimal balance between learned and innate behaviors in natural and artificial systems goes back several decades. However, it has recently found also a wide range of applications in applied AI systems ; . Most AI systems are trained for specific tasks, and have no need for modification after their training has been completed.
Still, technological advances and the necessity to solve broad families of tasks make discussions about life-like AI systems relevant to a wide range of potential application areas. Thus the idea of open-ended AI agents that can continually interact with and adapt to changing environments has become particularly appealing.
Many different approaches for introducing lifelong learning in artificial agents have been proposed. Some of them draw direct inspiration from actual biological systems ; . Among them, the most biologically plausible solution is to equip artificial neural networks with some local neural plasticity , similar to the large variety of synaptic plasticity mechanisms ; ; that performs the bulk of the learning in the brains of living organisms .
The artificial plasticity mechanisms can be optimized to modify the connectivity of the artificial neural networks toward solving a particular task. The optimization can use a variety of approaches, most commonly evolutionary computation. The idea of meta-learning or optimizing synaptic plasticity rules to perform specific functions has been recently established as an engineering tool that can compete with stateof-the-art machine learning algorithms on various complex tasks ; ; Pedersen and Risi (2021); .
Additionally, it can be used to reverse engineer actual plasticity mechanisms found in biological neural networks and uncover their functions ; . Here, we study the effect that different factors (environ-arXiv:2303.06734v1 [q-bio.NC] 12 Mar 2023 mental fluctuation and reliability, task complexity) have on the form of evolved functional reward-modulated plasticity rules.
We investigate the evolution of plasticity rules in static, single-layer simple networks. Then we increase the complexity by switching to moving agents performing a complex foraging task. In both cases, we study the impact of different environmental parameters on the form of the evolved plasticity mechanisms and the interaction of learned and static network connectivity.
Interestingly, we find that different environmental conditions and different combinations of static and plastic connectivity have a very large impact on the resulting plasticity rules. We imagine an agent who must forage to survive in an environment presenting various types of complex food particles. Each food particle is composed of various amounts and combinations of N ingredients that can have positive (food) or negative (poison) values.
The value of a food particle is a weighted sum of its ingredients. To predict the reward value of a given resource, the agent must learn the values of these ingredients by interacting with the environment. The priors could be generated by genetic memory, but the exact values are subject to change. To introduce environmental variability, we stochastically change the values of the ingredients.
More precisely, we define two ingredient-value distributions E 1 and E 2 and switch between them, with probability p tr for every time step. We control how (dis)similar the environments are by parametrically setting E 2 = (1 − 2d e )E 1 , with d e ∈ [0, 1] serving as a distance proxy for the environments; when d e = 0, the environment remains unchanged, and when d e = 1 the value of each ingredient fully reverses when the environmental transition happens.
For simplicity, we take values of the ingredients in E 1 equally spaced between -1 and 1 (for the visualization, see Fig. ). The static agent receives passively presented food as a vector of ingredients and can assess its compound value using the linear summation of its sensors with the (learned or evolved) weights, see Fig. .
The network consists of N sensory neurons that are projecting to a single post-synaptic neuron. At each time step, an input X t = (x 1 , . . . , x N ) is presented, were the value x i , i ∈ {1, . . . , N } represents the quantity of the ingredient i. We draw x i independently form a uniform distribution on the [0, 1] interval (x i ∼ U (0, 1)).
The value of each ingredient w c i is determined by the environment (E 1 or E 2 ). The postsynaptic neuron outputs a prediction of the food X t value as y t = g(W X T t ). Throughout the paper, g will be either the identity function, in which case the prediction neuron is linear, or a step-function; however, it could be any other nonlinearity, such as a sigmoid or ReLU.
After outputting the prediction, the neuron receives feedback in the form of the real value of the input R t . The real value is computed as R t = W c X T t + ξ, where W c = (w c 1 , . . . , w c N ) is the actual value of the ingredients, and ξ is a term summarizing the noise of reward and sensing system ξ ∼ N (0, σ).
Figure : An outline of the static agent's network. The sensor layer receives inputs representing the quantity of each ingredient of a given food at each time step. The agent computes the prediction of the food's value y t and is then given the true value R t ; it finally uses this information in the plasticity rule to update the weight matrix.
For the evolutionary adjustment of the agent's parameters, the loss of the static agent is the sum of the mean squared errors (MSE) between its prediction y t and the reward R t over the lifetime of the agent. The agent's initial weights are set to the average of the two ingredient value distributions, which is the optimal initial value for the case of symmetric switching of environments that we consider here.
As a next step, we incorporate the sensory network of static agents into embodied agents that can move around in an environment scattered with food. To this end, we merge the static agent's network with a second, non-plastic motor network that is responsible for controlling the motion of the agent in the environment.
Specifically, the original plastic network now provides the agent with information about the value of the nearest food. The embodied agent has additional sensors for the distance from the nearest food, the angle between the current velocity and the nearest food direction, its own velocity, and its own energy level (sum of consumed food values).
These inputs are processed by two hidden layers (of 30 and 15 neurons) with tanh activation. The network's outputs are angular and linear acceleration, Fig. . The embodied agents spawn in a 2D space with periodic boundary conditions along with a number of food particles that are selected such that the mean of the food value distribution is ∼ 0. An agent can eat food by approaching it sufficiently closely, and each time a food particle is eaten, it is The sensor layer receives inputs at each time step (the ingredients of the nearest food), which are processed by the plastic layer in the same way as the static sensory network, Fig. .
The output of that network is given as input to the motor network, along with the distance d and angle α to the nearest food, the current velocity v, and energy E of the agent. These signals are processed through two hidden layers to the final output of motor commands as the linear and angular acceleration of the agent re-spawned with the same value somewhere randomly on the grid (following the setup of ).
After 5000 time steps, the cumulative reward of the agent (the sum of the values of all the food it consumed) is taken as its fitness. During the evolutionary optimization, the parameters for both the motor network (connections) and plastic network (learning rule parameters) are co-evolved, and so agents must simultaneously learn to move and discriminate good/bad food.
Reward-modulated plasticity is one of the most promising explanations for biological credit assignment . In our network, the plasticity rule that updates the weights of the linear sensor network is a rewardmodulated rule which is parameterized as a linear combination of the input, the output, and the reward at each time step:
Additionally, after each plasticity step, the weights are normalized by mean subtraction, an important step for the stabilization of Hebbian-like plasticity rules . We use a genetic algorithm to optimize the learning rate η p and amplitudes of different terms θ = (θ 1 , . . . , θ 8 ). The successful plasticity rule after many food presentations must converge to a weight vector that predicts the correct food values (or allows the agent to correctly decide whether to eat a food or avoid it).
To have comparable results, we divide θ = (θ 1 , . . . , θ 8 ) by We then multiply the learning rate η p with θ max to maintain the rule's evolved form unchanged, η norm p = η p • θ max . In the following, we always use normalized η p and θ, omitting norm . To evolve the plasticity rule and the moving agents' motor networks, we use a simple genetic algorithm with elitism .
The agents' parameters are initialized at random (drawn from a Gaussian distribution), then the sensory network is trained by the plasticity rule and finally, the agents are evaluated. After each generation, the bestperforming agents (top 10 % of the population size) are selected and copied into the next generation.
The remaining 90 % of the generation is repopulated with mutated copies of the best-performing agents. We mutate agents by adding independent Gaussian noise (σ = 0.1) to its parameters. To start with, we consider a static agent whose goal is to identify the value of presented food correctly. The static reward-prediction network quickly evolves the parameters of the learning rule, successfully solving the prediction task.
We first look at the evolved learning rate η p , which determines how fast (if at all) the network's weight vector is updated during the lifetime of the agents. We identify three factors that control the learning rate parameter the EA converges to: the distance between the environments, the noisiness of the reward, and the rate of environmental transition.
The first natural factor is the distance d e between the two environments, with a larger distance requiring a higher learning rate, Fig. . This is an expected result since the convergence time to the ""correct"" weights is highly dependent on the initial conditions. If an agent is born at a point very close to optimality, which naturally happens if the environments are similar, the distance it needs to traverse on the fitness landscape is small.
Therefore it can afford to have a small learning rate, which leads to a more stable convergence and is not affected by noise. A second parameter that impacts the learning rate is the variance of the rewards. The reward an agent receives for the plasticity step contains a noise term ξ that is drawn from a zero mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation σ.
This parameter controls the unreliability of the agent's sensory system, i.e., higher σ means that the information the agent gets about the value of the foods it consumes cannot be fully trusted to reflect the actual value of the foods. As σ increases, the learning rate η p decreases, which means that the more unreliable an environment becomes, the less an agent relies on plasticity to update its weights, Fig. .
Indeed for some combinations of relatively small distance d e and high reward variance σ, the EA converges to a learning rate of η p ≈ 0. This means that the agent opts to have no adaptation during its lifetime and remain at the mean of the two environments. It is an optimal solution when the expected loss due to ignoring the environmental transitions is, on average, lower than the loss the plastic network will incur by learning via the (often misleading because of the high σ) environmental cues.
A final factor that affects the learning rate the EA will converge to is the frequency of environmental change during an agent's lifetime. Since the environmental change is modeled as a simple, two-state Markov process (Fig. ), the control parameter is the transition probability p tr . When keeping everything else the same, the learning rate rapidly rises as we increase the transition probability from 0, and after reaching a peak, it begins to decline slowly, eventually reaching zero (Fig. ).
This means that when environmental transition is very rare, agents opt for a very low learning rate, allowing a slow and stable convergence to an environment-appropriate weight vector that leads to very low losses while the agent remains in that environment. As the rate of environmental transition increases, faster learning is required to speed up convergence in order to exploit the (comparatively shorter) stays in each environment.
Finally, as the environmental transition becomes too fast, the agents opt for slower or even no learning, which keeps them ) and the decision (b.) tasks, for a variety of parameters (p tr = 0.01, d e ∈ 0, 0.1, . . . , 1, and σ ∈ 0, 0.1, . . . , 1 in all 100 combinations). Despite the relatively small difference between the tasks, the evolved learning rules differ considerably.
For visual guidance, the lines connect θs from the same run. near the middle of the two environments, ensuring that the average loss of the two environments is minimal (Fig. ). The form of the evolved learning rule depends on the task: Decision vs. Prediction The plasticity parameters θ = (θ 1 , . . . , θ 8 ) for the rewardprediction task converge on approximately the same point, regardless of the environmental parameters (Fig. ).
In particular, θ 3 → 1, θ 5 → −1, θ i → 0 for all other i, and thus the learning rule converges to: Since by definition y t = g(W t X T t ) = W t X T t (g(x) = x in this experiment) and R t = W c X T t + ξ we get: Thus the distribution of ∆W t converges to a distribution with mean 0 and variance depending on η p and σ and W converges to W c .
So this learning rule will match the agent's weight vector with the vector of ingredient values in the environment. We examine the robustness of the learning rule the EA discovers by considering a slight modification of our task. Instead of predicting the expected food value, the agent now needs to decide whether to eat the presented food or not.
This is done by introducing a step-function nonlinearity (g(x) = 1 if x ≥ 1 and 0 otherwise). Then the output y(t) is computed as: Instead of the MSE loss between prediction and actual value, the fitness of the agent is now defined as the sum of the food values it chose to consume (by giving y t = 1). Besides these two changes, the setup of the experiments remains exactly the same.
The qualitative relation between η p and parameters of environment d e , σ and p tr is preserved in the changed experiment. However, the resulting learning rule is significantly different (Fig. ). The evolution converges to the following learning rule: In both cases, the rule has the form ∆W t = η p X t [α y R t + β y ].
Thus, the ∆W t is positive or negative depending on whether the reward R t is above or below a threshold (γ = −β y /α y ) that depends on the output decision of the network (y t = 0 or 1). Both learning rules (for the reward-prediction and decision tasks) have a clear Hebbian form (coordination of preand post-synaptic activity) and use the incoming reward signal as a threshold.
These similarities indicate some common organizing principles of reward-modulated learning rules, but their significant differences highlight the sensitivity of the optimization process to task details. We now turn to the moving embodied agents in the 2D environment. To optimize these agents, both the motor network's connections and the sensory network's plasticity parameters evolve simultaneously.
Since the motor network is initially random and the agent has to move to find food, the number of interactions an agent experiences in its lifetime can be small, slowing down the learning. However, having the larger motor network also has benefits for evolution because it allows the output of the plastic network to be read out and transformed in different ways, resulting in a broad set of solutions.
The fitness of an agent (measured as the total food consumed over its lifetime) increases over generations of the EA for both the scalar and binary readouts in the sensory network. e. The Pearson correlation coefficient of an evolved agent's weights with the ingredient value vector of the current environment (E 1 -blue, E 2 -red).
In this example, the agent's weights are anti-correlated with its environment, which is not an issue for performance since the motor network can interpret the inverted signs of food. The agents can solve the task effectively by evolving a functional motor network and a plasticity rule that converges to interpretable weights (Fig. ).
After ∼ 100 evolutionary steps (Fig. ), the agents can learn the ingredient value distribution using the plastic network and reliably move towards foods with positive values while avoiding the ones with negative values. We compare the dependence of the moving and the static agents on the parameters of the environment: d e and the state transition probability p tr .
At first, in order to simplify the experiment, we set the transition probability to 0, but fixed the initial weights to be the average of E 1 and E 2 , while the real state is E 2 . In this experiment, the distance between states d e indicates twice the distance between the agent's initial weights and the optimal weights (the environment's ingredient values) since the agent is initialized at the mean of the two environment distributions.
Same as for the static agent, the learning rate increases with the distance d e (Fig. ). Then, we examine the effect of the environmental transition probability p tr on the evolved learning rate η p . In order for an agent to get sufficient exposure to each environment, we scale down the probability p tr from the equivalent experiment for the static agents.
We find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate η p decreases (Fig. ). This fits with the larger trend for the static agent, although there is a clear difference when it comes to the increase for very small transition probabil-ities that were clearly identifiable in the static but not the moving agents.
This could be due to much sparser data and possibly the insufficiently long lifetime of the moving agent (the necessity of scaling makes direct comparisons difficult). Nevertheless, overall we see that the associations observed in the static agents between environmental distance d e and transition probability p tr and the evolved learning rate η p are largely maintained in the moving agents.
Still, more data would be needed to make any conclusive assertions about the exact effect of these environmental parameters on the emerging plasticity mechanisms. A crucial difference between the static and the moving agents is the function the plasticity has to perform. While in the static agents, the plasticity has to effectively identify the exact value distribution of the environment in order to produce accurate predictions, in the embodied agents, the plasticity has to merely produce a representation of the environment that the motor network can evolve to interpret adequately enough to make decisions about which food to consume.
To illustrate the difference, we plot the Pearson correlation coefficient between an agent's weights and the ingredient values of the environment it is moving in (Fig. ). We use the correlation instead of the MSE loss (which we used for the static agents in Fig. ) because the amplitude of the vector varies a lot for different agents and meaningful The evolved parameters of moving agents' plasticity rule for the g(s) = x, identity (a.) and the step function (Eq.
4) (b.) sensory networks (the environmental parameters here are d e ∈ [0, 1], σ = 0 and p tr = 0.001). The step function (binary output) network evolved a more structured plasticity rule (e.g., θ 3 > 0 for all realizations) than the linear network. Moreover, the learned weights for the identity network (c.) have higher variance and correlate significantly less with the environment's ingredient distribution compared to the learned weights for the thresholded network (d.)
conclusions cannot be drawn from the MSE loss. For many agents, the learned weights are consistently anti-correlated with the actual ingredient values (an example of such an agent is shown in Fig. ). This means that the output of the sensory network will have the opposite sign from the actual food value.
While in the static network, this would lead to very bad predictions and high loss, in the foraging task, these agents perform exactly as well as the ones where the weights and ingredients values are positively correlated, since the motor network can simply learn to move towards food for which it gets a negative instead of a positive sensory input.
This additional step of the output of the plastic network going through the motor network before producing any behavior has a strong effect on the plasticity rules that the embodied agents evolve. Specifically, if we look at the emerging rules the top performing agents have evolved (Fig. ), it becomes clear that, unlike the very well-structured rules of the static agents (Fig. ), there is now virtually no discernible pattern or structure.
The difference becomes even clearer if we look at the learned weights (at the end of a simulation) of the best-performing agents (Fig. ). While there is some correlation with the environment's ingredient value distribution, the variance is very large, and they do not seem to converge on the ""correct"" values in any way.
This is to some extent expected since, unlike the static agents where the network's output has to be exactly correct, driving the evolution of rules that converge to the precise environmental distribution, in the embodied networks, the bulk of the processing is done by the motor network which can evolve to interpret the scalar value of the sensory network's output in a variety of ways.
Thus, as long as the sensory network's plasticity rule co-evolves with the motor network, any plasticity rule that learns to produce consistent information about the value of encountered food can potentially be selected. To further test this assumption, we introduce a bottleneck of information propagation between the sensory and motor networks by using a step-function nonlinearity on the output of the sensory network (Eq.
4). Similarly to the decision task of the static network, the output of the sensory network now becomes binary. This effectively reduces the flow of information from the sensory to the motor network, forcing the sensory network to consistently decide whether food should be consumed (with the caveat that the motor network can still interpret the binary sign in either of two ways, either consuming food marked with 1 or the ones marked with 0 by the sensory network).
The agents perform equally well in this variation of the task as before (Fig. ), but now, the evolved plasticity rules seem to be more structured (Fig. ). Moreover, the variance of the learned weights in the bestperforming agents is significantly reduced (Fig. ), which indicates that the bottleneck in the sensory network is in-creasing selection pressure for rules that learn the environment's food distribution accurately.
We find that different sources of variability have a strong impact on the extent to which evolving agents will develop neuronal plasticity mechanisms for adapting to their environment. A diverse environment, a reliable sensory system, and a rate of environmental change that is neither too large nor too small are necessary conditions for an agent to be able to effectively adapt via synaptic plasticity.
Additionally, we find that minor variations of the task an agent has to solve or the parametrization of the network can give rise to significantly different plasticity rules. Our results partially extend to embodied artificial agents performing a foraging task. We show that environmental variability also pushes the development of plasticity in such agents.
Still, in contrast to the static agents, we find that the interaction of a static motor network with a plastic sensory network gives rise to a much greater variety of wellfunctioning learning rules. We propose a potential cause of this degeneracy; as the relatively complex motor network is allowed to read out and process the outputs from the plastic network, any consistent information coming out of these outputs can be potentially interpreted in a behaviorally useful way.
Reducing the information the motor network can extract from the sensory system significantly limits learning rule variability. Our findings on the effect of environmental variability concur with the findings of previous studies that have identified the constraints that environmental variability places on the evolutionary viability of learning behaviors.
We extend these findings in a mechanistic model which uses a biologically plausible learning mechanism (synaptic plasticity). We show how a simple evolutionary algorithm can optimize the different parameters of a simple reward-modulated plasticity rule for solving simple prediction and decision tasks.
Reward-modulated plasticity has been extensively studied as a plausible mechanism for credit assignment in the brain ; ; and has found several applications in artificial intelligence and robotics tasks ; . Here, we demonstrate how such rules can be very well-tuned to take into account different environmental parameters and produce optimal behavior in simple systems.
Additionally, we demonstrate how the co-evolution of plasticity and static functional connectivity in different subnetworks fundamentally changes the evolutionary pressures on the resulting plasticity rules, allowing for greater diversity in the form of the learning rule and the resulting learned connectivity.
Several studies have demonstrated how, in biological networks, synaptic plasticity heavily interacts with and is driven by network topology . Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that biological plasticity mechanisms are highly redundant in the sense that any observed neural connectivity or recorded activity can be achieved with a variety of distinct, unrelated learning rules .
This observed redundancy of learning rules in biological settings complements our results and suggests that the function of plasticity rules cannot be studied independently of the connectivity and topology of the networks they are acting on. The optimization of functional plasticity in neural networks is a promising research direction both as a means to understand biological learning processes and as a tool for building more autonomous artificial systems.
Our results suggest that reward-modulated plasticity is highly adaptable to different environments and can be incorporated into larger systems that solve complex tasks. This work studies a simplified toy model of neural network learning in stochastic environments. Future work could be built on this basic framework to examine more complex reward distributions and sources of environmental variability.
Moreover, a greater degree of biological realism could be added by studying more plausible network architectures (multiple plastic layers, recurrent and feedback connections) and more sophisticated plasticity rule parametrizations. Additionally, our foraging simulations were constrained by limited computational resources and were far from exhaustive.
Further experiments can investigate environments with different constraints, food distributions, multiple seasons, more complex motor control systems and interactions of those systems with different sensory networks as well as the inclusion of plasticity on the motor parts of the artificial organisms.","['As the transition probability increases, the learning rate initially rises and then declines.']",5346,multifieldqa_en,en,,7ae0ad8d4ded2dee79251ff4f951ecfcabad31d8b4f896ae," Environmental variability and network structure determine the optimal plasticity mechanisms in embodied agents.

The fitness of an agent (measured as the total food consumed over its lifetime) increases over generations of the EA for both the scalar and binary readouts in the sensory network. The Pearson correlation coefficient of an evolved agent's weights with the ingredient value vector of the current environment (E 1 -blue, E 2 -red) is not an issue for performance since the motor network can interpret the inverted signs of food. For the capacity to learn to be beneficial in evolutionary terms, a costly nurturing period is often required, a phenomenon observed in both biological, and artificial organisms. It is unclear how the ability to learn first evolved, but its utility appears evident. In some complex environments, hardcoded behaviors may be superior to learned ones given limits in the agent's lifetime and envi-ronmental uncertainty.

What kind of ultracold neutral plasmas does this study focus on?,"\section{Introduction}

Ultracold neutral plasmas studied in the laboratory offer access to a regime of plasma physics that scales to describe thermodynamic aspects of important high-energy-density systems, including strongly coupled astrophysical plasmas \cite{VanHorn,Burrows}, as well as terrestrial sources of neutrons \cite{Hinton,Ichimaru_fusion,Atzeni,Boozer} and x-ray radiation \cite{Rousse,Esarey}.  Yet, under certain conditions, low-temperature laboratory plasmas evolve with dynamics that are governed by the quantum mechanical properties of their constituent particles, and in some cases by coherence with an external electromagnetic field.   

The relevance of ultracold plasmas to such a broad scope of problems in classical and quantum many-body physics has given rise to a great deal of experimental and theoretical research on these systems since their discovery in the late 90s.  A series of reviews affords a good overview of progress in the last twenty years \cite{Gallagher,Killian_Science,PhysRept,Lyon}.  Here, we focus on the subset of ultracold neutral plasmas that form via kinetic rate processes from state-selected Rydberg gases, and emphasize in particular the distinctive dynamics found in the evolution of molecular ultracold plasmas.  

While molecular beam investigations of threshold photoionization spectroscopy had uncovered relevant effects a few years earlier \cite{Scherzer,Alt}, the field of ultracold plasma physics began in earnest with the 1999 experiment of Rolston and coworkers on metastable xenon atoms cooled in a magneto optical trap (MOT) \cite{Killian}.  

This work and many subsequent efforts tuned the photoionization energy as a means to form a plasma of very low electron temperature built on a strongly coupled cloud of ultracold ions.  Experiment and theory soon established that fast processes associated with disorder-induced heating and longer-time electron-ion collisional rate processes act to elevate the ion temperatures to around one degree Kelvin, and constrain the effective initial electron temperature to a range above 30 K \cite{Kuzmin,Hanson,Laha}.  

This apparent limit on the thermal energy of the electrons can be more universally expressed for an expanding plasma by saying that the electron correlation parameter, $\Gamma_e$, does not exceed 0.25, where, 
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_e = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 a_{ws}}\frac{1}{k_B T_e}
\label{eqn:gamma_e}
\end{equation}
defines the ratio of the average unscreened electron-electron potential energy to the electron kinetic energy.  $a_{ws}$ is the Wigner-Seitz radius, related to the electron density by, $\rho_e = 1/(\frac{4}{3} \pi a_{ws}^3)$.  These plasmas of weakly coupled electrons and strongly coupled ions have provided an important testing ground for ion transport theory and the study of electron-ion collision physics \cite{Strickler}.

Soon after the initial reports of ultracold plasmas formed by direct photoionization, a parallel effort began with emphasis on the plasma that forms spontaneously by Penning ionization and electron-impact avalanche in a dense ultracold Rydberg gas \cite{Mourachko}.  This process affords less apparent control of the initial electron temperature.  But, pulsed field-ionization measurements soon established that the photoionized plasma and that formed by the avalanche of a Rydberg gas both evolve to quasi-equilibria of electrons, ions and high-Rydberg neutrals \cite{Rolston_expand,Gallagher}.  

Early efforts to understand plasmas formed by Rydberg gas avalanche paid particular attention to the process of initiation.  Evolution to plasma in effusive atomic beams was long known for high-Rydberg gases of caesium and well explained by coupled rate equations \cite{Vitrant}.  But, low densities and ultracold velocity distributions were thought to exclude Rydberg-Rydberg collisional mechanisms in a MOT.  

In work on ultracold Rydberg gases of Rb and Cs, Gallagher, Pillet and coworkers describe the initial growth of electron signal by a model that includes ionization by blackbody radiation and collisions with a background of uncooled Rydberg atoms \cite{Mourachko,Gallagher,Li,Comparat,Tanner}. This picture was subsequently refined to include many-body excitation and autoionization, as well as attractive dipole-dipole interactions \cite{Viteau,Pillet}, later confirmed by experiments at Rice \cite{Mcquillen}.  

The Orsay group also studied the effect of adding Rydberg atoms to an established ultracold plasma.  They found that electron collisions in this environment completely ionize added atoms, even when selected to have deep binding energies \cite{Vanhaecke}.  They concluded from estimates of electron trapping efficiency that the addition of Rydberg atoms does not significantly alter the electron temperature of the plasma.  

Tuning pair distributions by varying the wavelength of the excitation laser, Weidem\""uller and coworkers confirmed the mechanical effects of van der Waals interactions on the rates of Penning ionization in ultracold $^{87}$Rb Rydberg gases \cite{Amthor_mech}.  They recognized blackbody radiation as a possible means of final-state redistribution, and extended this mechanical picture to include long-range repulsive interactions \cite{Amthor_model}.  This group later studied the effects of spatial correlations in the spontaneous avalanche of Rydberg gases in a regime of strong blockade, suggesting a persistence of initial spatial correlations \cite{RobertdeSaintVincent}.  

Robicheaux and coworkers have recently investigated the question of prompt many-body ionization from the point of view of Monte Carlo classical trajectory calculations \cite{Goforth}.  For atoms on a regular or random grid driven classically by an electromagnetic field, they find that many-body excitation enhances prompt ionization by about twenty percent for densities greater than $5.6 \times 10^{-3}/(n_0^2 a_0)^3$, where $n_0$ is the principal quantum number of the Rydberg gas and $a_0$ is the Bohr radius.  They observed that density fluctuations (sampled from the distribution of nearest neighbour distances) have a greater effect, and point to the possible additional influence of secondary electron-Rydberg collisions and the Penning production of fast atoms not considered by the model, but already observed by Raithel and coworkers \cite{Knuffman}.  

The Raithel group also found direct evidence for electron collisional $\ell$-mixing in a Rb MOT \cite{Dutta}, and used selective field ionization to monitor evolution to plasma on a microsecond timescale in ultracold $^{85}$Rb $65d$ Rydberg gases with densities as low as $10^8$ cm$^{-3}$ \cite{WalzFlannigan}.  Research by our group at UBC has observed very much the same dynamics in the relaxation of Xe Rydberg gases of similar density prepared in a molecular beam \cite{Hung2014}.  In both cases, the time evolution to avalanche is well-described by coupled rate equations (see below), assuming an initializing density of Penning electrons determined by Robicheaux's criterion \cite{Robicheaux05}, applied to an Erlang distribution of Rydberg-Rydberg nearest neighbours.  

Theoretical investigations of ultracold plasma physics have focused for the most part on the long- and short-time dynamics of plasmas formed by direct photoionization \cite{PhysRept,Lyon}.  In addition to studies mentioned above, key insights on the evolution dynamics of Rydberg gases have been provided by studies of Pohl and coworkers exploring the effects of ion correlations and recombination-reionization on the hydrodynamics of plasma expansion \cite{Pohl:2003,PPR}.  Further research has drawn upon molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reformulate rate coefficients for the transitions driven by electron impact between highly excited Rydberg states \cite{PVS}, and describe an effect of strong coupling as it suppresses three-body recombination \cite{Bannasch:2011}.  MD simulations confirm the accuracy of coupled rate equation descriptions for systems with $\Gamma$ as large as 0.3.  Newer calculations suggest a strong connection between the order created by dipole blockade in Rydberg gases and the most favourable correlated distribution of ions in a corresponding strongly coupled ultracold plasma \cite{Bannasch:2013}.  

Tate and coworkers have studied ultracold plasma avalanche and expansion theoretically as well as experimentally.  Modelling observed expansion rates, they recently found that $^{85}$Rb atoms in a MOT form plasmas with effective initial electron temperatures determined by initial Rydberg density and the selected initial binding energy, to the extent that these parameters determine the fraction of the excited atoms that ionize by electron impact in the avalanche to plasma \cite{Forest}.  This group also returned to the question of added Rydberg atoms, and managed to identify a crossover in $n_0$, depending on the initial electron temperature, that determines whether added Rydberg atoms of a particular initial binding energy act to heat or cool the electron temperature \cite{Crockett}.   

Our group has focused on the plasma that evolves from a Rydberg gas under the low-temperature conditions of a skimmed, seeded supersonic molecular beam.  In work on nitric oxide starting in 2008 \cite{Morrison2008,Plasma_expan,Morrison_shock,PCCP}, we established an initial kinetics of electron impact avalanche ionization that conforms with coupled rate equation models \cite{Saquet2011,Saquet2012,Scaling,haenelCP} and agrees at early times with the properties of ultracold plasmas that evolve from ultracold atoms in a MOT.  We have also observed unique properties of the NO ultracold plasma owing to the fact that its Rydberg states dissociate \cite{Haenel2017}, and identified relaxation pathways that may give rise to quantum effects \cite{SousMBL,SousNJP}.  The remainder of this review focuses on the nitric oxide ultracold plasma and the unique characteristics conferred by its evolution from a Rydberg gas in a laser-crossed molecular beam.  


\section{Avalanche to strong coupling in a molecular Rydberg gas}

\subsection{The molecular beam ultracold plasma compared with a MOT}

When formed with sufficient density, a Rydberg gas of principal quantum number $n_0>30$ undergoes a spontaneous avalanche to form an ultracold plasma \cite{Li,Morrison2008,RobertdeSaintVincent}.  Collisional rate processes combine with ambipolar hydrodynamics to govern the properties of the evolving plasma.  For a molecular Rydberg gas, neutral fragmentation, occurs in concert with electron-impact ionization, three-body recombination and electron-Rydberg inelastic scattering.  Neutral dissociation combined with radial expansion in a shaped distribution of charged particles, can give rise to striking effects of self-assembly and spatial correlation \cite{Schulz-Weiling2016,Haenel2017}.   

The formation of a molecular ultracold plasma requires the conditions of local temperature and density afforded by a high mach-number skimmed supersonic molecular beam.  Such a beam propagates at high velocity in the laboratory, with exceedingly well-defined hydrodynamic properties, including a propagation-distance-dependent density and sub-Kelvin temperature in the moving frame \cite{MSW_tutorial}.  The low-temperature gas in a supersonic molecular beam differs in three important ways from the atomic gas laser-cooled in a magneto-optical trap (MOT).

The milli-Kelvin temperature of the gas of ground-state NO molecules entrained in a beam substantially exceeds the sub-100 micro-Kelvin temperature of laser-cooled atoms in a MOT.  However, the evolution to plasma tends to erase this distinction, and the two further characteristics that distinguish a beam offer important advantages for ultracold plasma physics:  Charged-particle densities in a molecular beam can exceed those attainable in a MOT by orders of magnitude.  A great many different chemical substances can be seeded in a free-jet expansion, and the possibility this affords to form other molecular ultracold plasmas, introduces interesting and potentially important new degrees of freedom governing the dynamics of their evolution.


\subsection{Supersonic molecular beam temperature and particle density}

Seeded in a skimmed supersonic molecular beam, nitric oxide forms different phase-space distributions in the longitudinal (propagation) and transverse coordinate dimensions.  As it propagates in $z$, the NO molecules reach a terminal laboratory velocity, $u_{\parallel}$, of about 1400 ${\rm ms^{-1}}$, which varies with the precise seeding ratio.  

The distribution of $v_{\parallel}$, narrows to define a local temperature, $T_{\parallel}$, of approximately 0.5 K.  The beam forms a Gaussian spatial distribution in the transverse coordinates, $x$ and $y$.  In this plane, the local velocity, $v_{\perp}(r)$ is defined for any radial distance almost entirely by the divergence velocity of the beam, $u_{\perp}(r)$.  Phase-space sorting cools the temperature in the transverse coordinates, $T_{\perp}$ to a value as low as $\sim 5$ mK \cite{MSW_tutorial}.  

The stagnation pressure and seeding ratio determine the local density distribution as a function of $z$.  For example, expanding from a stagnation pressure of 500 kPa with a 1:10 seeding ratio, a molecular beam propagates 2.5 cm to a skimmer and then 7.5 cm to a point of laser interaction, where it contains NO at a peak density of $1.6 \times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$.  

Here, crossing the molecular beam with a laser beam tuned to the transition sequence, ${\rm X} ~^2 \Pi_{1/2} ~N'' = 1 \xrightarrow{\omega_1} {\rm A} ~^2\Sigma^+ ~N'=0  \xrightarrow{\omega_2} n_0 f(2)$ forms a Gaussian ellipsoidal volume of Rydberg gas in a single selected principal quantum number, $n_0$, orbital angular momentum, $\ell = 3$, NO$^+$ core rotational quantum number, $N^+ = 2$ and total angular momentum neglecting spin, $N=1$.  

A typical $\omega_1$ pulse energy of 2 $\mu$J and a Gaussian width of 0.2 mm serves to drive the first step of this sequence in a regime of linear absorption.  Overlapping this volume by an $\omega_2$ pulse with sufficient fluence to saturate the second step forms a Rydberg gas ellipsoid with a nominal peak density of $5 \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$  \cite{Morrison2008,MSW_tutorial}.  Fluctuations in the pulse energy and longitudinal mode of $\omega_1$ cause the real density to vary.  For certain experiments, we find it convenient to saturate the $\omega_1$ transition, and vary the density of Rydberg gas by delaying $\omega_2$.  An $\omega_1$-$\omega_2$ delay, $\Delta t$, reduces the Rydberg gas density by a precise factor, $e^{-\Delta t/\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the 200 ns radiative lifetime of NO ${\rm A} ~^2\Sigma^+ ~N'=0$ \cite{Carter,Hancock}.


\subsection{Penning ionization}

The density distribution of a Rydberg gas defines a local mean nearest neighbour distance, or Wigner-Seitz radius of $ a_{ws} =  \left(3/4 \pi \rho \right)^{1/3} $, where $\rho$ refers to the local Rydberg gas density.  For example, a Rydberg gas with a density of $ \rho_0=0.5 \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-3} $ forms an Erlang distribution \cite{Torquato.1990} of nearest neighbour separations with a mean value of $ 2 a_{ws}=1.6$  $\mu$m.  

A semi-classical model \cite{Robicheaux05} suggests that 90 percent of Rydberg molecule pairs separated by a critical distance, $ r_c = 1.8 \cdot 2 n_0^2 a_0 $ or less undergo Penning ionization within 800 Rydberg periods.  We can integrate the Erlang distribution from $ r=0 $ to the critical distance $r = r_c$ for a Rydberg gas of given $n_0$, to define the local density of Penning electrons ($ \rho_e$ at $t=0$) produced by this prompt interaction, for any given initial local density, $\rho_0$ by the expression:
\begin{equation}
\rho_e(\rho_0,n_0) = \frac{0.9}{2} \cdot 4 \pi \rho_0 ^2\int_0^{r_{c}} r^2 \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{4\pi}{3}\rho_0 r^3}\mathrm{d}r \quad.
\label{eqn:Erlang}
\end{equation}

Evaluating this definite integral yields an equation in closed form that predicts the Penning electron density for any particular initial Rydberg density and principal quantum number.
\begin{equation}
\rho_e(\rho_0,n_0) =\frac{0.9 \rho_0}{2}(1-\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{4\pi}{3}\rho_0 r_c^3}) \quad.
\label{Eq:PenDens}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{Penning_Latice.pdf}
\caption{Distributions of ion-ion nearest neighbours following Penning ionization and electron-impact avalanche simulated for a predissociating molecular Rydberg gas of initial principal quantum number, $n_0$, from 30 to 80, and density of 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$.  Dashed lines mark corresponding values of $a_{ws}$. Calculated by counting ion distances after relaxation to plasma in 10$^6$-particle stochastic simulations. Integrated areas proportional to populations surviving neutral dissociation.}
\label{fig:PL}
\end{figure}

Prompt Penning ionization acts on the portion of the initial nearest-neighbour distribution in the Rydberg gas that lies within $r_c$.  When a molecule ionizes, its collision partner relaxes to a lower principal quantum number, $n'<n_0/\sqrt{2}$.  This close-coupled interaction disrupts the separability of Rydberg orbital configurations in the Penning partner.  This causes mixing with core penetrating states that are strongly dissociative.  Penning partners are thus very likely to dissociate, leaving a spatially isolated distribution of ions.  We refer to the spatial correlation that results as a Penning lattice \cite{Sadeghi:2014}.  The extent of this effect varies depending on the local density and the selected initial principal quantum number.  Figure \ref{fig:PL} shows the degree to which Rydberg gases with initial principal quantum numbers from 30 to 80 form a Penning lattice for an initial density of $1 \times 10^{12} ~{\rm cm}^{-3}$.  

\subsection{Spontaneous electron-impact avalanche}

The electrons produced by prompt Penning ionization start an electron impact avalanche.  The kinetics of this process are well described by a set of coupled rate equations that account for state-to-state electron-Rydberg inelastic scattering, electron-impact ionization and three-body ion-electron recombination \cite{PPR,Saquet2011,Saquet2012,Scaling} using detailed rate coefficients,  $k_{ij}$, $k_{i,ion}$ and $k_{i,tbr}$ validated by MD simulations \cite{PVS}.  
\begin{eqnarray}
-\frac{d\rho_i}{dt}&=&\sum_{j}{k_{ij}\rho_e\rho_i}-\sum_{j}{k_{ji}\rho_e\rho_j} \nonumber\\
&& +k_{i,ion}\rho_e\rho_i-k_{i,tbr}\rho^3_e 
  \label{level_i}
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent and,
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\rho_e}{dt}=\sum_{i}{k_{i,ion}\rho_e^2}-\sum_{i}{k_{i,tbr}\rho^3_e}
  \label{electron}
\end{equation}

The relaxation of Rydberg molecules balances with collisional ionization to determine an evolving temperature of avalanche electrons to conserve total energy per unit volume. 
\begin{equation}
E_{tot}=\frac{3}{2}k_BT_e(t)\rho_e(t)-R\sum_i{\frac{\rho_i(t)}{n_i^2}},
  \label{energy}
\end{equation}
Here, for simplicity, we neglect the longer-time effects of Rydberg predissociation and electron-ion dissociative recombination \cite{Saquet2012}.

Such calculations show that the conversion from Rydberg gas to plasma occurs on a timescale determined largely by the local Penning electron density, or Penning fraction, $P_f = \rho_e/\rho_0$, which depends on the local density of Rydberg molecules and their initial principal quantum number.  

Avalanche times predicted by coupled rate equation calculations range widely.  For example, in a model developed for experiments on xenon, simulations predict that a Rydberg gas with $n_0 = 42$ at a density of $8.8 \times 10^8 ~{\rm cm}^{-3}$ ($P_f = 6 \times 10^{-5}$) avalanches with a half time of  40 $\mu$s \cite{Hung2014}.  At an opposite extreme, rate equations estimate that a Rydberg gas of NO with $n_0=60$ at a density of $1 \times 10^{12} ~{\rm cm}^{-3}$ ($P_f = 0.3$) rises to plasma in about 2 ns \cite{Saquet2012}.  

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width= .49 \textwidth]{SFI_n=49.pdf}
   \caption{Contour plots showing SFI signal as a function the applied field for an $nf(2)$ Rydberg gas with an initial principal quantum number, $n_0=49$.  Each frame represents 4,000 SFI traces, sorted by initial Rydberg gas density.  Ramp field beginning at 0 and 150 ns (top, left to right), and  300 and 450 ns (bottom) after the $\omega_2$ laser pulse.  The two bars of signal most evident at early ramp field delay times represent the field ionization of the $49f(2)$ Rydberg state respectively to NO$^+$ X $^1\Sigma^+$ cation rotational states, $N^+=0$ and 2.  The signal waveform extracted near zero applied field represents the growing population of plasma electrons.  
   }
\label{fig:SFI}
\end{figure}

Selective field ionization (SFI) probes the spectrum of binding energies in a Rydberg gas.  Applied as a function of time after photoexcitation, SFI maps the evolution from a state of selected initial principal quantum number, $n_0$, to plasma \cite{Haenel2017}.  Figure \ref{fig:SFI} shows SFI spectra taken at a sequence of delays after the formation of $49f(2)$ Rydberg gases of varying density.    

Here, we can see that a $49f(2)$ Rydberg gas with an estimated initial density $\rho_0 = 3 \times 10^{11} ~{\rm cm}^{-3}$ relaxes to plasma on a timescale of about 500 ns.  Observations such as these agree well with the predictions of coupled rate-equation calculations.  We can understand this variation in relaxation dynamics with $\rho_0$ and $n_0$ quite simply in terms of the corresponding density of prompt Penning electrons these conditions afford to initiate the avalanche to plasma.  

Figure \ref{fig:scaled_rise} illustrates this, showing how rise times predicted by coupled rate-equation simulations for a large range of initial densities and principal quantum number match when plotted as a function of time scaled by the ultimate plasma frequency and fraction of prompt Penning electrons.  The dashed line gives an approximate account of the scaled rate of avalanche under all conditions of Rydberg gas density and initial principal quantum number in terms of the simple sigmoidal function:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\rho_e}{\rho_0} = \frac{a}{b+e^{-c\tau}},
  \label{scaledEq1}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{equation}
\tau = t \omega_e P_f^{3/4},
  \label{scaledEq2}
\end{equation}
in which $\omega_e$ is the plasma frequency after avalanche, $P_f$ is the fraction of prompt Penning electrons, and $a = 0.00062$,  $b =   0.00082$ and $c =     0.075$ are empirical coefficients.

\subsection{Evolution to plasma in a Rydberg gas Gaussian ellipsoid}

As outlined above, the local density and principal quantum number together determine the rate at which a Rydberg gas avalanches to plasma.  Our experiment crosses a 2 mm wide cylindrically Gaussian molecular beam with a 1 mm diameter TEM$_{00}$ $\omega_1$ laser beam to produce a Gaussian ellipsoidal distribution of molecules excited to the A $^2\Sigma^+$ $v=0, ~N'=0$ intermediate state.  A larger diameter $\omega_2$ pulse then drives a second step that forms a Rydberg gas in a single $n_0f(2)$ state with the spatial distribution of the intermediate state.  

We model this shaped Rydberg gas as a system of 100 concentric ellipsoidal shells of varying density \cite{haenelCP}.  Coupled rate equations within each shell describe the avalanche to plasma.  This rate process proceeds from shell to shell with successively longer induction periods, determined by the local density as detailed above.  The rising conversion of Rydberg molecules to ions plus neutral dissociation products conserves the particle number in each shell.  We assume that local space charge confines electrons to shells, conserving quasi-neutrality.  Electrons exchange kinetic energy at the boundaries of each shell, which determines a single plasma electron temperature.  

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width= .5 \textwidth]{shell_model_100}
   \caption{(top frame) Cross-sectional contour diagram in the $x,y$ plane for $z=0$ describing the distribution of ion plus electron density over 100 shells of Gaussian ellipsoid with initial dimensions, $\sigma_x= 0.75$ mm and $\sigma_y= \sigma_z = 0.42$ mm and an initial $n_0 = 50$ Rydberg gas density, $\rho_0 = 2 \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{3}$ after an evolution time of 100 ns.

\label{fig:shell}
\end{figure}

The upper frame of Figure \ref{fig:shell} shows contours of NO$^+$ ion density after 100 ns obtained from a shell-model coupled rate-equation simulation of the avalanche of a Gaussian ellipsoidal Rydberg gas of nitric oxide with a selected initial state, $50f(2)$ and a density of $2 \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$.  Here, we simulate a relaxation that includes channels of predissociation at every Rydberg level and redistributes the energy released to electrons, which determines a uniform rising electron temperature for all shells.  

For comparison, the lower frame plots curves describing the ion density of each shell as a function of time from 20 to 100 ns, as determined by applying Eq \ref{scaledEq1} for the local conditions of initial Rydberg gas density.  This numerical approximation contains no provision for predissociation.  Coupled rate-equation simulations for uniform volumes show that predissociation depresses yield to some degree, but has less effect on the avalanche kinetics \cite{Saquet2012}.  Therefore, we can expect sets of numerically estimated shell densities, scaled to agree with the simulated ion density at the elapsed time of 100 ns to provide a reasonable account of the earlier NO$^+$ density profiles as a function of time.   


\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width= .4 \textwidth]{Shell_pop}

   }
\label{fig:shell_yields}
\end{figure}

For each time step, the difference, $\rho_0 - \rho_e$ defines the neutral population of each shell.  We assign a fraction of this population to surviving Rydberg molecules, such that the total population of NO$^*$ as a function of time agrees with the prediction of the shell-model simulation, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:shell_yields}.  We consider the balance of this neutral population to reflect NO$^*$ molecules that have dissociated to form N($^4$S) $+$ O($^3$P).  Figure \ref{fig:shell} plots these surviving Rydberg densities as a function of radial distance for each evolution time.  At the initial density of this simulation, note at each time step that a higher density of Rydberg molecules encloses the tail of the ion density distribution in $x$.   

\subsection{Plasma expansion and NO$^+$ - NO$^*$ charge exchange as an avenue of quench}

We regard the ions as initially stationary.  The release of electrons creates a radial electric potential gradient, which gives rise to a force, $-e\nabla \phi_{k,j}(t)$, that accelerates the ions in shell $j$ in direction $k$ according to \cite{Sadeghi.2012}:

\begin{align}
\frac{-e}{m'}\nabla \phi_{k,j}(t) = & \frac{\partial u_{k,j}(t)}{\partial t} \notag  \\
= & \frac{k_BT_e(t)}{m'\rho_j(t)} \frac{\rho_{j+1}(t) - \rho_j(t)}{r_{k,j+1}(t) - r_{k,j}(t)},
  \label{dr_dt}
\end{align}

\noindent where $\rho_j(t)$ represents the density of ions in shell $j$.  

The instantaneous velocity, $u_{k,j}(t)$ determines the change in the radial coordinates of each shell, $r_{k,j}(t)$, 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial r_{k,j}(t)}{\partial t}=u_{k,j}(t) = \gamma_{k,j}(t) r_{k,j}(t),
  \label{dr_dt}
\end{equation}
\noindent which in turn determines shell volume and thus its density, $ \rho_j(t)$.   
The electron temperature supplies the thermal energy that drives this ambipolar expansion.  Ions accelerate and $T_e$ falls according to: 

\begin{equation}
\frac{3k_B}{2}\frac{\partial T_e(t)}{\partial t}= -\frac{m'}{\sum_{j}{N_j}}\sum_{k,j}{N_j u_{k,j}(t)\frac{\partial u_{k,j}(t)}{\partial t}},
  \label{dr_dt}
\end{equation}
\noindent where we define an effective ion mass, $m'$, that recognizes the redistribution of the electron expansion force over all the NO$^+$ charge centres by resonant ion-Rydberg charge exchange, which occurs with a very large cross section \cite{PPR}.  
\begin{equation}
m' =\left (1+ \frac{\rho^*_{j}(t)}{ \rho_j(t)}\right) m ,
  \label{dr_dt}
\end{equation}
\noindent in which $\rho^*_{j}(t)$ represents the instantaneous Rydberg density in shell $j$.

The initial avalanche in the high-density core of the ellipsoid leaves few Rydberg molecules, so this term has little initial effect.  Rydberg molecules predominate in the lower-density wings.  There, momentum sharing by charge exchange assumes a greater importance.  

We see this most directly in the $\omega_2$ absorption spectrum of transitions to states in the $n_0 f(2)$ Rydberg series, detected as the long-lived signal that survives a flight time of 400 $\mu$s to reach the imaging detector.  The balance between the rising density of ions and the falling density of Rydberg molecules depends on the initial density of electrons produced by prompt Penning ionization.  As clear from Eq \ref{Eq:PenDens}, this Penning fraction depends sensitively on the principal quantum number, and for all principal quantum numbers, on the initial Rydberg gas density.  

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width= .4 \textwidth]{w2_spectra}
   \caption{Double-resonant spectra of nitric oxide Rydberg states in the $nf$ series converging to NO$^+$ $v=0$, $N^+=2$ (designated, $nf(2)$), derived from the late-peak signal obtained after a flight time of 400 $\mu$s by scanning $\omega_2$ for $\omega_1$ tuned to NO A $^2\Sigma^+$ $v=0$, $N'=0$ for initial $nf(2)$ densities from top to bottom of 0.07, 0.10, 0.13, 0.19, 0.27, 0.30, 0.32 and $3 \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{3}$.  
  }
\label{fig:w2_spectra}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:w2_spectra} shows a series of $\omega_2$ late-signal excitation spectra for a set of initial densities.  Here, we see a clear consequence of the higher-order dependence of Penning fraction - and thus the NO$^+$ ion - NO$^*$ Rydberg molecule balance - on $n_0$, the $\omega_2$-selected Rydberg gas initial principal quantum number.  This Penning-regulated NO$^+$ ion - NO$^*$ Rydberg molecule balance appears necessary as a critical factor in achieving the long ultracold plasma lifetime required to produce this signal.  We are progressing in theoretical work that explains the stability apparently conferred by this balance.  


\subsection{Bifurcation and arrested relaxation}

Ambipolar expansion quenches electron kinetic energy as the initially formed plasma expands.  Core ions follow electrons into the wings of the Rydberg gas.  There, recurring charge exchange between NO$^+$ ions and NO$^*$ Rydberg molecules redistributes the ambipolar force of the expanding electron gas, equalizing ion and Rydberg velocities.  This momentum matching effectively channels electron energy through ion motion into the overall $\pm x$ motion of gas volumes in the laboratory.  The internal kinetic energy of the plasma, which at this point is defined almost entirely by the ion-Rydberg relative motion, falls.  Spatial correlation develops, and over a period of 500 ns, the system forms the plasma/high-Rydberg quasi-equilibrium dramatically evidenced by the SFI results in Figure \ref{fig:SFI}.  

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[width= .4 \textwidth]{Bifurcation.pdf}

   }
\label{fig:bifurcation}
\end{figure}

In the wings, momentum redistribution owing to cycles of ion-Rydberg charge transfer retards radial expansion \cite{Pohl2003,PPR}.  By redirecting electron energy from ambipolar acceleration to $\pm x$ plasma motion, NO$^+$ to NO$^*$ charge exchange dissipates electron thermal energy.  This redistribution of energy released in the avalanche of the Rydberg gas to plasma, causes the ellipsoidal Rydberg gas to bifurcate \cite{Schulz-Weiling2016,Haenel2017}, forming very long-lived, separating charged-particle distributions.  We capture the electron signal from these recoiling volumes on an imaging detector as pictured in Figure \ref{fig:bifurcation}.  Here, momentum matching preserves density and enables ions and Rydberg molecules to relax to positions that minimize potential energy, building spatial correlation.  

The semi-classical description of avalanche and relaxation outlined above forms an important point of reference from which to interpret our experimental observations.  The laser crossed molecular beam illumination geometry creates a Rydberg gas with a distinctively shaped high-density spatial distribution.  This initial condition has an evident effect on the evolution dynamics.  We have developed semi-classical models that explicitly consider the coupled rate and hydrodynamic processes governing the evolution from Rydberg gas to plasma using a realistic, ellipsoidal representation of the ion/electron and Rydberg densities \cite{haenelCP}.  No combination of initial conditions can produce a simulation that conforms classically with the state of arrested relaxation we observe experimentally. 


\subsection{A molecular ultracold plasma state of arrested relaxation}

Thus, we find that spontaneous avalanche to plasma splits the core of an ellipsoidal Rydberg gas of nitric oxide. As ambipolar expansion quenches the electron temperature of this core plasma, long-range, resonant charge transfer from ballistic ions to frozen Rydberg molecules in the wings of the ellipsoid quenches the ion-Rydberg molecule relative velocity distribution. This sequence of steps gives rise to a remarkable mechanics of self-assembly, in which the kinetic energy of initially formed hot electrons and ions drives an observed separation of plasma volumes. These dynamics redistribute ion momentum, efficiently channeling electron energy into a reservoir of mass-transport. This starts a process that evidently anneals separating volumes to a state of cold, correlated ions, electrons and Rydberg molecules. 

We have devised a three-dimensional spin model to describe this arrested state of the ultracold plasma in terms of two, three and four-level dipole-dipole energy transfer interactions (spin flip-flops), together with Ising interactions that arise from the concerted pairwise coupling of resonant pairs of dipoles \cite{SousMBL,SousNJP}.  

The Hamiltonian includes the effects of onsite disorder owing to the broad spectrum of states populated in the ensemble and the unique electrostatic environment of every dipole.  Extending ideas developed for simpler systems \cite{Burin1,Sondhi}, one can make a case for slow dynamics, including an arrest in the relaxation of NO Rydberg molecules to predissociating states of lower principal quantum number.

Systems of higher dimension ought to thermalize by energy transfer that spreads from rare but inevitable ergodic volumes (Griffiths regions) \cite{Sarang2, Roeck_griffith, RareRegions_rev, Thermal_inclusions}.  However, a feature in the self-assembly of the molecular ultracold plasma may preclude destabilization by rare thermal domains:  Whenever the quenched plasma develops a delocalizing Griffiths region, the local predissociation of relaxing NO molecules promptly proceeds to deplete that region to a void of no consequence.

In summary, the classical dynamics of avalanche and bifurcation appear to create a quenched condition of low temperature and high disorder in which dipole-dipole interactions drive self-assembly to a localized state purified by the predissociation of thermal regions.  We suggest that this state of the quenched ultracold plasma offers an experimental platform for studying quantum many-body physics of disordered systems. \\

They form via kinetic rate processes from state-selected Rydberg gases. They have provided an important testing ground for ion transport theory and the study of electron-ion collision physics. We focus on the subset of ultracoldneutral pl asmas that form viaKinetic rate processes. We also emphasize the distinctive dynamics found in the evolution of molecular ultracolds. We describe the initial growth in the growth of research in the field of Ultracold Plasmas. We conclude with an overview of the progress made in the last twenty years of research on the field.

This picture was subsequently refined to include many-body excitation and autoionization, as well as attractive dipole-dipole interactions. Research by our group at UBC has observed very much the same dynamics in the relaxation of Xe Ryd Berg gases of similar density prepared in a molecular beam. In both cases, the time evolution to avalanche is well-described by coupled rate equations (see below), assuming an initializing density of Penning electrons determined by Robicheaux's criterion. This group later studied the effects of spatial correlations in the spontaneous avalanche of Rydburg gases in a regime of strong blockade, suggesting a persistence of initial spatial correlations. The Raithel group also found direct evidence for electron collisional $\ell$-mixing in a Rb MOT, and used selective field ionization to monitor evolution to plasma on a microsecond timescale in ultracold $^{85}$Rb $65d$ Rdberg gases with densities as low as $10^8$ cm$^{-3}$ The formation of a molecular ultracold plasma requires the conditions of local temperature and density afforded by a high mach-number skimmed supersonic molecular beam. Newer calculations suggest a strong connection between the order created by dipole blockade in Rydberg gases and the most favourable correlated distribution of ions in a corresponding strongly coupled ultracolds plasma. The low-temperature gas in a supersonIC molecular beam differs in three important ways from the atomic gas laser-cooled in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). The milli-Kelvin temperature of the gas of ground-state NO molecules entrained in a beam substantially exceeds the sub-100 micro-KELvin temperature in a MOT. Charged-particle densities in a molecular beam can exceed those attainable by a MOT by orders of magnitude. A great deal of chemical expansion can be seeded in a free-jet expansion of many different chemical can be achieved. The NO ultrac old plasma has unique properties owing to the fact that its Ryd Berg states dissociate. It also has relaxation pathways that may give rise to quantum effects. Seeded in a skimmed supersonic molecular beam, nitric oxide forms different phase-space distributions in the longitudinal (propagation) and transverse coordinate dimensions. As it propagates in $z$, the NO molecules reach a terminal laboratory velocity of about 1400 mK. The density distribution of a Rydberg gas defines a local mean nearest neighbour distance, or Wigner-Seitz radius of a radius of $4/3/3. For certain experiments, we find it convenient to saturate the $z$ transition, and vary the density of Rydburg gas by delaying $1/2/2, $2/3, $3/4, $5/5, $6/6, $7/7, $8/8, $9/9, $10/10, $11/11, $12/12, $13/13, $14/14, $15/15, $16/16, $17/17, $18/18, $19/19, $20/20, $21/21, $22/22, $23/23, $24/24, $25/25, $26/26, $27/28, $28/29, $29/28. Penning ionization acts on the portion of the initial nearest-neighbour distribution in the Rydberg gas that lies within $r_c$. When a molecule ionizes, its collision partner relaxes to a lower principal quantum number, $n'<n_0/\sqrt{2}$. This close-coupled interaction disrupts the separability of Ryd Berg orbital configurations in the Penning partner. Penning partners are thus very likely to dissociate, leaving a spatially isolated distribution of ions. The extent of this effect varies depending on the local density and the selected initial quantum number. The electrons produced by prompt Penning ionized start an electron impact avalanche. The energy per unit unit of avalanche determine the evolving temperature per unit of the avalanche. Such calculations show that the conversion from Rydburg gas to plasma occurs on a local timescale determined by the longer-time effects of the Rydenberg gas on a plasma. We neglect the longer time effects of a plasma on a longer timescale, for simplicity, we neglect the no-time effect of the plasma on the Ridenberg gas. We refer to the spatial correlation that results as a Penning lattice. We call it the ‘Penning lattices’. Selective field ionization (SFI) probes the spectrum of binding energies in a Rydberg gas. SFI maps the evolution from a state of selected initial principal quantum number, $n_0$, to plasma. A $49f(2)$ Ryd Berg gas with an estimated initial density relaxes to plasma on a timescale of about 500 ns. The rise times predicted by coupled rate-equation simulations for a large range of initial densities and principal quantum numbers match when plotted as a function of time scaled by the ultimate plasma frequency and fraction of prompt Penning electrons. The dashed line gives an approximate account of the scaled rate of avalanche under all conditions of Rydburg gas density and initial principal Quantum number in terms of the simple sigmoidal function: $\omega_e$ and fraction, $\rho_e(t=0) P_f$ are empirical coefficients. Our experiment crosses a 2 mm wide cylindrically Gaussian molecular beam with a 1 mm diameter laser beam to produce a Ryberg gas avalanches to a plasma. As outlined above, the local density and principalQuantum number together determine the rate at which a R yberg gas avalanche takes place. We can understand this variation in relaxation dynamics by looking at the density of prompt electrons in the gas. We assume that local space charge confines electrons to shells, conserving quasi-neutrality. Electrons exchange kinetic energy at the boundaries of each shell, which determines a single plasma electron temperature. We simulate a relaxation that includes channels of predissociation at every Rydberg level and redistributes the energy released to electrons. This determines a uniform rising electron temperature for all shells. We consider the balance of this neutral population to reflect NO$^*$ molecules that have dissociated to form N($^4$S) $+$ O($^3$P) as detailed above. We assign a fraction of this population to surviving Ryd Berg molecules, such that the total population of NO$*$ as a function of time agrees with the prediction of the shell-model simulation. We conclude that NO$+$ is an avenue of exchange as an avenue for quench of quench charge as well as for the formation of superconductors. We propose a new theory of supernovae that could be used to explain the origin of the quench effect in supernovas. We call this theory the NO-supernovae theory and it is based on the theory of the superconducting superconductor, which has been used in a number of previous studies. The balance between the rising density of ions and the falling density of Rydberg molecules depends on the initial density of electrons produced by prompt Penning ionization. We see this most directly in the absorption spectrum of transitions to states in the $n_0 f(2)$ Ryd Berg series, detected as the long-lived signal that survives a flight time of 400 $\mu$s to reach the imaging detector. This Penning fraction depends sensitively on the principal quantum number, and for all principal quantum numbers, on theinitial Rydburg gas density. We show a clear consequence of the higher-order dependence of the NO+$ ion fraction - and thus the NO$+ ion fraction of Penning ions - in the spectra of nitric oxide Rydberg states converging to NO$^+$ $v=0$ (designated, $nf( 2)$), derived from the late-peak signal obtained after a flighttime of 400 $mu#s. We also show that the balance between ions and RydBERG molecules is dependent on the ion-Rydberg balance on the Penning-regulated NO+ ion-regulated ion number. We conclude that Penning ionization has a positive effect on the balance. The system forms the plasma/high-Rydberg quasi-equilibrium dramatically evidenced by the SFI results in Figure. The laser crossed molecular beam illumination geometry creates a Rydberg gas with a distinctively shaped high-density spatial distribution. We have developed semi-classical models that explicitly consider the coupled rate and hydrodynamic processes governing the evolution from Ryd Berg gas to plasma. The Hamiltonian includes the effects of onsite disorder owing to the broad spectrum of states populated in the ensemble and the unique electrostatic environment of every dipole. The model describes this arrested state of the ultracold plasma in terms of two, three and four-level dipole-dipole energy transfer interactions (spin flip-flops), together with Ising interactions that arise from the concerted pairwise coupling of resonant pairs of dipoles. We find that spontaneous avalanche to plasma splits the core of an ellipsoidal Rydburg gas of nitric oxide. As ambipolar expansion quenches the electron temperature of this core plasma, long-range, resonant charge transfer from ballistic ions to frozen Rydenberg molecules in the wings of theEllipsoid quenched the ion-Ryden molecule relative velocity distribution. This sequence of steps gives rise to a remarkable mechanics of self-assembly. A feature in the self-assembly of the molecular ultracold plasma may preclude destabilization by rare thermal domains. Whenever the quenched plasma develops a delocalizing Griffiths region, the local predissociation of relaxing NO molecules promptly proceeds to deplete that region to a void of no consequence. We suggest that this state offers an experimental platform for studying quantum many-body physics of disordered systems."
What types of sensors are now capable of estimating physical activity levels and physiological outcomes of older adults?,"\section{Introduction}
Cognitive deficit of older adults is one of the biggest global public health challenges in elderly care. Approximately 5.2 million people of 65 and older are suffered with any form of cognitive impairments in United States in 2012 \cite{stat12}. Dementia is one of the major causes of the cognitive impairments which is more acute among 85 and older population (50\%) \cite{stat12}. However, the costs (financial and time) of health care and long-term care for individuals with Alzheimer's (special form of dementia) or other dementias are substantial. For example, during 2016, about 15.9 million family and friends in United States provided 18.2 billion hours of unpaid assistance to those with cognitive impairments which is a contribution to the nation valued at \$230.1 billion. One the other hand, total payments for all individuals with all form of cognitive impairments are estimated at \$259 billion. Total annual payments for health care, long-term care and hospice care for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias are projected to increase from \$259 billion in 2017 to more than \$1.1 trillion in 2050. Among the above costs, a significant amount are relevant to clinical and diagnostic tests \cite{stat17}. Although clinical and diagnostic tests have become more precise in identifying dementia, studies have shown that there is a high degree of underrecognition especially in early detection. However, there are many advantages to obtaining an early and accurate diagnosis when cognitive symptoms are first noticed as the root cause findings of impairment always lessen the progress of impairment status and sometimes symptoms can be reversible and cured.

With the proliferation of emerging ubiquitous computing technologies, many mobile and wearable devices have been available to capture continuous functional and physiological behavior of older adults. Wearable sensors are now capable of estimating number of steps being taken, physical activity levels, sleep patterns and physiological outcomes (heart rate, skin conductance) of older adults \cite{sano15}. Ambient sensors also help capture the movement patterns of objects and humans for activity and behavior recognition \cite{dawadi14,dawadi15}. Researchers also proved the existence of correlations between cognitive impairment and everyday task performance \cite{dawadi14, akl15,alam16} as well as physiological symptoms \cite{alam16,sano15}. Although current studies showed some successes in IoT-assisted cognitive health assessment in different domains individually, there are several existing challenges in developing and validating a fully automated multi-modal assessment model.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Real-time IoT System}: A real-time IoT system must include a continuous and fault tolerant data streaming capability among central hub, wearable sensors and ambient sensors regardless of network communication protocol (WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth etc.) which are not available in existing researches.
\item \emph{Multi-modal Context Fusion}: Though several offline clinically validated cognitive health assessment tools exist \cite{wai03, starling99, krapp07, yesavage82, zung71}, there is no universally accepted method for IoT-assisted automatic cognitive health assessment in smart home environment that can fuse multi-modal sensor contexts altogether. For example, some researchers showed ambient sensors based Activities of Daily Livigin (ADLs) sequence pattern can signify the cognitive health status of older adults \cite{akl15, dawadi15}. Researchers also showed wearable Electrodermal Activity pattern analysis may carry the significance of cognitive status \cite{sano15}. However, for validation of IoT based cognitive health assessment, self-reported surveys, clinical diagnosis and observation based tools are used individually by prior researchers \cite{akl15, dawadi15, sano15, alam16}.
\end{enumerate}

Regarding aforementioned challenges for the automation of cognitive health assessment, \emph{AutoCogniSys} considers (i) reproducibility of our model in any smart home system consists of ambient motion sensors, wearable accelerometer (ACC) sensors, wearable Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors individually or combined streams; (ii) context awareness based on ambient motion sensors and wearable ACC sensors in any types of activities such as hand gestural, postural and complex ADLs; and (iii) high accuracy, i.e., a recall rate of over 90\% with less than 5\% false positive rate. More specifically, \emph{AutoCogniSys} extends our existing work \cite{alam16} in three dimensions,

\emph{(1) True Automation:} We first investigate the correlations of cognitive impairment with human activities and stress where we manually labeled activities, extract the corresponding physiological sensor (EDA and PPG) features of each activity, and use statistical method to find correlations. Then, we propose automatic complex activity recognition based on a Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Network (HDBN) model, fine-grained extraction of physiological sensor features and finally machine learning classification of cognitive impairment.

\emph{(2) Noises Elimination:} We define different types of noises on ACC, EDA and PPG sensors, propose extensive signal processing techniques to remove noises and show significant improvement can be achieved in cognitive impairment classification.

\emph{(3) Implementation and Evaluation:} Finally, we design and implement IoT system and analytic methods and minimize the human involvement to automate our proposed cognitive health assessment approach by considering effective smart home sensor customization and deployment, data collection, screening, cleaning and filtering, feature computation, normalization and classification, and activity  model training.

\textbf{Research Questions:} \emph{AutoCogniSys} consequently tackles the following key research questions.

$\bullet$ Can we detect simultaneously the periodic rhythms of  both hand gestures and postural activities from wrist-worn ACC sensor signal for diverse population (population with same activity but diverse ways such as walking with walker, stretcher or normally)? If so, how can we incorporate the hand gesture, posture and ambient sensor data streams to help improve the ADLs recognition models?

$\bullet$ How can we exploit and relate the micro-activity features into noise free physiological sensor signals processing to automate cognitive health assessment process? What are the critical roles of clinical survey and technology guided assessment methodologies and their inter-relationships for automating the different intermediate steps of cognitive health assessment process?

To tackle these, we make the following \textbf{key contributions}:

$\bullet$ We employ an extensive signal deconvolution technique that in conjunction with machine learning technique helps facilitate a wrist-worn ACC-based multi-label (hand gestural and postural) activity recognition for diverse population. We then leverage multi-label context sets with ambient and object sensor signals for complex activity recognition based on HDBN model.

$\bullet$ We propose a novel collaborative filter for EDA signal processing by postulating signal as a mixture of three components: \emph{tonic phase, phasic phase} and \emph{motion artifacts}, and employ convex optimization technique for filtering out the motion artifacts. We also propose a novel PPG signal processing technique to filter out the inherent motion artifacts and noises using improved Periodic Moving Average Filtering (PMAF) technique.

$\bullet$  We design and prototype an IoT system consisting of multiple devices (wearable wrist band, IP camera, object and ambient sensors) connected with central hub via WiFi, Ethernet and Bluetooth communication protocols. We collected data from 22 older adults living in a continuing care retirement community center in a very natural setting (IRB \#HP-00064387).

$\bullet$ Finally, we employ statistical and machine learning techniques to jointly correlate the activity performance metrics and stress (EDA and PPG) features that helps achieve max. 93\% of cognitive impairment status detection accuracy. We evaluate \emph{AutoCogniSys} on 5 clinically validated offline assessment tools as ground truth.
\section{Related Works}
\emph{AutoCogniSys} builds on previous works on wearable devices based low-level (postural and hand gestural) activity recognition and their integration with ambient sensors to recognize complex ADLs, the underlying signal processing and applications on cognitive health assessment automation.
\subsection{Wearable Sensor Signal Processing}
Wearable sensors can be two types: physical and physiological. Physical sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope etc.) signal values change over the movements of the sensor devices. Physiological sensors change over physiological condition of body such as EDA changes over stress and PPG changes over heart rate. However, physical movements also impose noises on physiological sensor signals which is called \emph{motion artifacts}.
\subsubsection{Physiological Signal Processing}
A continuous and descrete decomposition of EDA, and time and frequency domain analytics of PPG signal have been investigated before to extract relevant physiological features which were contaminated with noises and motion artifacts \cite{alam16}. \cite{setz10} denoised and classified EDA from cognitive load and stress with accuracy higher than 80\%. Though motion artifacts removal techniques such as exponential smoothing \cite{hern11} and low-pass filters \cite{poh10, hernandez14} provide significant improvement in filtering EDA signals, wavelet transforms offer more sophisticated refinement for any kind of physiological sensors such as electroencephalogram \cite{krish06, zikov02}, electrocardiogram \cite{erc06,alfa08}, and PPG \cite{lee03}. \cite{chen15} proposed a stationary wavelet transform (SWT) based motion artifacts removal technique. `cvxEDA' proposed  a convex optimization technique considering EDA as a mixture of white gaussian noise, tonic and phasic components where white gaussian noise includes motion artifacts and external noises \cite{greco16}. \emph{AutoCogniSys} intelligently combines SWT and `cvxEDA' together to remove noises and motion artifacts from EDA signal. On the other hand, it is more difficult to remove motion artifacts from PPG signal due to its periodicity of nature \cite{wang13}. Researchers proposed different methods such as frequency analytics \cite{garde13,wang13}, statistical analytics \cite{peng14} and digital filter \cite{lee10} to reduce noises and motion artifacts from PPG. \emph{AutoCogniSys} used Periodic Moving Average Filter (PMAF) in this regard \cite{lee07}.
\subsubsection{Physical Sensor Signal Processing}
ACC based hand gesture recognition has been explored by several researchers in past such as discrete hidden markov model \cite{liu10}, artificial neural network \cite{arce11}, weighted naive bayes and dynamic time warping \cite{mace13}. Akl et. al. proposed 18 gesture dictionary based Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier \cite{akl11}. Wrist-worn ACC based postural activity recognition approach has been proposed using Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes and deep neural networks \cite{gj14, wang16}, the accuracy stagnates at 85\% using SVM method \cite{martin16}. However, neither of past works proposed any technique that can provide single body worn ACC sensor-based multiple body contexts recognition nor works efficiently for diverse posture say walking normally, with walker, with double walker or wheel chair. Our proposed 8-hand gesture recognition technique assisted sparse-deconvolution method improves classification performances on both normal and diverse postures. However, we incorporated hand gestures and postures in conjunction with ambient sensors into single-inhabitant HDBN model \cite{alam16b} that provides significant improvement in complex activity recognition.
\subsection{Cognitive Health Assessment}
Smart home environment has been used for providing automated health monitoring and assessment in the ageing population before \cite{dawadi14, gong15, akl15, dawadi15}. `SmartFABER' proposed a non-intrusive sensor network based continuous smart home environmental sensor data acquisition and a novel hybrid statistical and knowledge-based technique to analyz the data to estimate behavioral anomalies for early detection of mild-cognitively impairment \cite{riboni16}. \cite{skubic15} presented an example of unobtrusive, continuous monitoring system for the purpose of assessing early health changes to alert caregivers about the potential signs of health hazards. Though, prior researches proposed a sequence of ambient motion sensor streams as complex activity components in activity based health assessment \cite{dawadi14, gong15, akl15, dawadi15}, we consider inclusion of an wearable wrist-band with in-built ACC sensor to detect hand gesture and posture, augmenting with the ambient sensor readings to help recognize complex activities as well as cognitive health assessment of older adults. Additionally, we propose intelligent use of physiological features of skin through different physiological sensor signals (EDA, PPG) processing in daily activity tasks and incorporate context-awareness for automation of cognitive health assessment that have not been explored before.

\section{Overall Architecture}
We first investigate existing IoT-based cognitive health care frameworks that covers every aspects of wearable (physical, physiological) and ambient (passive infrared and object) sensor signals computing. \emph{AutoCogniSys} is comprised of three component modules: (i)~sensing, (ii)~processing, and (iii)~analysis. The `sensing' module consists of clinical assessment tools (surveys, observation and clinical backgrounds) and sensing signals (ambient and wearable sensors). `Sensor processing' module is comprised of three sub-modules: a)~clinical assessment feature extraction from assessment tools; b)~ambient sensor feature extraction; and c)~wearable sensor processing (noise removal, segmentation, feature extraction, classification etc.). `Analysis' module is comprised of machine learning and statistical analytics-based score prediction of cognitive impairment. Automation of each module's functionality and inter-intra modular transactions without human interference can be called {\it true automation} of cognitive health assessment. Fig.~\ref{fig:overview} shows the overall flow of \emph{AutoCogniSys} which is discussed in details in the following sections.
\subsection{Demographic Ground Truth Data Collection}
Currently in standard clinical practice and research, the most accurate evaluations of cognitive health assessment are one-to-one observation and supervision tasks/questionnaires for monitoring an individual's functional abilities and behavior \cite{resnick15}. In the first stage of this pilot study, we have investigated current literatures and carefully chosen the clinically proven functional and behavioral health assessment survey tools \cite{resnick15}. On the other hand, to cross check with the survey based evaluations, we have also chosen clinically justified observation based behavioral assessment methods. First, following the resident consent, our clinical research evaluator collects demographic and descriptive data (age, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, education and medical commodities). She has performed two types of clinical assessments: (1) \emph{Observation based} where the resident's cognition is assessed using the Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) scale \cite{wai03}. (2) \emph{Survey based} where five widely used and clinically well validated surveys are taken into account: (a) \emph{Yale Physical Activity Survey} \cite{starling99}; (b) \emph{Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living}; (c) \emph{Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living} \cite{krapp07}; (d) \emph{Geriatric Depression Rating scale} \cite{yesavage82}; and (e) \emph{Zung Self-Rating Anxiety scale} \cite{zung71}.
\subsection{Smart Environment Creation}
For an ideal IoT-based system, instrumenting and deploying it at each participant's natural living environment warrants for assembling a flexible set of hardware and software interfaces to ease the system configuration, setup, and network discovery processes. The sensor system placed in the residences of volunteers needs to meet several specific physiological signals and activity monitoring needs. However, we must confirm that the devices are reliable with potential for re-deployment as well as appear unintimidating to the participants. Inspired by the above requirements, we developed a real testbed IoT system, {\it SenseBox}, by customizing Cloud Engine PogoPlug Mobile base station firmware to integrate with WiFi (connect ambient and object sensors) and Bluetooth (connect wristband) protocol. The smart home components are as follows: (i) PogoPlug base server with a continuous power supply, (ii) 3 binary Passive Infrared sensors in three different rooms (kitchen, livingroom and bedroom) to capture room level occupancy, (iii) 7 binary object sensors attached with closet door, entry door, telephone, broom, laundry basket, trash can and trash box, (iv) three IP cameras in the appropriate positions to collect the ground truth data and (v) an Empatica E4 \cite{empatica} wrist-band (integrated sensors: PPG at 64 Hz, EDA at 4 Hz, Body temperature at 1 Hz and a triaxial ACC at 32 Hz) on the participant's dominating hand.
\section{Activity Recognition}
We aim to detect single wrist-worn ACC sensor based hand gesture and postural activities and insert these into an HDBN graphical model in conjunction with ambient and object sensor values for complex activity recognition. We consider the recognition problem asan activity tupple of $\langle gesture,posture,ambient,object \rangle$. Though, Alam et. al. provides significant performance improvement for single wrist-worn ACC sensor aided 18-hand gesture based postural activity recognition in lab environment \cite{alam17}, it faces some practical challenges in real-time smart environment with older adults due to the diversity of their postures. For example, some older adults use walker, double walking sticks or wheel chair for walking in which cases collecting 18 hand gestures and corresponding postural activities for training requires endless efforts and carefulness. To reduce the complexity of ground truth labeling and later state space explosion for graphical model (HDBN), we propose to use rotational normalization method that can merge some hand-gestures subject to directional differences and forms an 8-hand gesture model. However, our proposed Feature Weight Naive Bayes (FWNB) classifier adds significant improvement on Alam et. al. proposed sparse-deconvolution method as well as recognition in diverse postural environment.

\subsection{Hand Gesture Recognition}
\label{sec:hand_gesture}
\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposes an 8-gesture dictionary (as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:hand_gestures}) and a Feature Weighted Naive Bayesian (FWNB) framework for building, modeling and recognizing hand gestures. The method comprises of the following steps: (i) \emph{Preprocessing:} wrist-worn ACC sensor provided 3-axis data are passed through 0.4Hz low-pass filter to remove the data drift. (ii) \emph{Rotation normalization:} Normalizing the rotation of hand gestures provides greater accuracy and allows for more realistic, orientation-independent motion. At first, we find the best fit plane of the acceleration vectors thus if the motion lies in a single plane, then the acceleration vectors of a closed shape should on average lie in that main plane. Then, we take all acceleration segments between points of inflection to form one single vector called reference vector that provides us the general direction of user's motion. After that, each vector is normalized relative to the reference vector. This normalization helps remove a lot of hand gestures from prior considered 18 hand gestures resulting a reduced dictionary of 8 gestures. (iii) \emph{Feature Weighted Naive Bayesian model:} Naive Bayes classifier is light-weight and efficient technique for hand gesture recognition. We extract 12 ACC features \cite{alam17} and calculate weight for each feature type based on the similarity of feature measures of the trained gestures (0$<$weight$<$1). While recognizing gestures, the proximity of each feature measure to the average trained feature measure of each gesture type is calculated by a normal distribution. Then, the proximity value is multiplied by the feature weight that was calculated in the training phase.  All of these multiplied values are added together and the system predicts the gesture type with the greatest value as the user gesture. In the learning data points, there should be static postural activities (such as sitting, lying etc.) to avoid unexpected noises over wrist-worn ACC sensors. In the final hand gesture dictionary, we save the reference vector as our signal dictionary.
\subsection{Postural Activity Recognition}
In normal lab environment, wrist-worn ACC sensor signal is a mixture (convolution) of actual hand gesture and postural activity relevant signals \cite{alam17}. \emph{AutoCogniSys} improves the idea by reducing the number of hand gestures and postural activities to 8 (as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:hand_gestures}) using rotation normalization and 4 (walking, sitting, standing and lying). Then, we use sparse-deconvolution method (with 31\% signal reconstruction error) to get Approximately Sparse Factor. The summary of the entire process is stated bellow:

{\it Building Deconvolution Method:} We first consider the wrist-worn ACC sensor signals (3-axis values) as a convolution of hand gesture and postural activity effects and build a deconvolution framework. The deconvolution framework takes a known signal (hand gesture effects) and a equalizer parameter ($\lambda$) as input and provides an Approximately Sparse Factor signal (postural activity effects) as output. For 3-axis ACC signals, we need to learn associated 3 equalizer parameters for each hand gesture. Moreover, each equalizer parameter is involved with 4 postural activities that results a total 96 ($8\times 3\times 4$) equalizer parameters to learn. 

{\it Learning Classification Model:} We use the Approximately Sparse Factor signal to extract 12 statistical features and SVM with sequential machine optimization (SMO) \cite{cao06} for postural activity recognition.

{\it Prediction Model:} After recognizing the hand gestures following the method explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:hand_gesture}, we take the corresponding reference vector as known signal and extract the Approximately Sparse Factor signals incorporating corresponding 3 equalizer parameters ($\lambda$) for the sparse-deconvolution method. Then, we apply feature extraction and prior learned SMO based SVM classifier \cite{cao06} to classify final postural activity. Fig.~\ref{fig:deconvolution} illustrates a single axis example of the deconvolution.

\subsection{Complex Activity Recognition}
We build a HDBN based complex activity recognition framework for single inhabitant scenario smart home environment \cite{alam16b} taking the advantage of detected hand gestural and postural activities along with the ambient and object sensor streams. At first, we obtain instant hand gestural and postural activities from our above proposed models, and additionally motion sensor and object sensor readings from our IoT-system for every time instant generating a 4-hierarchy of HDBN model. Considering the context set $\langle gestural, postural, ambient,object\rangle$ as a hierarchical activity structure (extending two 2-hierarchical HDBN \cite{alam16b}), we build complex activity recognition model for single inhabitant scenario. Finally, we infer the most-likely sequence of complex activities (and their time boundaries), utilizing the well-known Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm \cite{dempster77} for training and the Viterbi algorithm \cite{forney73} for run-time inference.
\section{Automatic Activity Features Estimation}
The effects of cognitive ability on daily activity performance have been studied before \cite{dawadi14,akl15}. They experimentally and clinically validated that cognitive impairment highly reduces the daily activity performances and this activity performance can be computed as an indicator of cognitive ability status of older adults. The standard activity features refer to completeness of task (TC), sequential task ability (SEQ), interruption avoidance capabilities (INT) etc. In current behavioral science literature, the above activity features carry specific definition based on the sub-tasks involved with a complex activity \cite{dawadi14,akl15}. Completeness of task refers to how many sub-tasks are missed by the participants. Sequential task ability refers to how many sequences of sub-tasks are missed referring the gerontologist defined standard sequences of the sub-task for the particular complex activity. Interruption avoidance capability refers to how many times the participants stop or interleave while doing any sub-task. The final goal of activity features estimation is to provide overall task score. The task score is proportional to the functional ability of participants in performance daily activities. Our behavioral scientist team, comprises with Nursing professor, gerontologist and retirement community caregivers, carefully discus, optimize and choose 87 sub-tasks in total for 13 complex activities.

Each of the sub-task comprises with sequential occurrences of hand gesture and postural activities. However, no researchers ever considered hand gesture for activity features estimation due to complexity of multi-modal wearable and ambient sensors synchronization and multi-label activity classification \cite{dawadi14,akl15}. \emph{AutoCogniSys} exploited single wrist-worn sensor based hand gesture and postural activity recognition, and proposed an activity features (TC, SEQ and INT) estimation method including these two parameters in conjunction with object and ambient sensor features that provide significant improvement of cognitive health assessment of older adults.
\subsection{Machine Learning Based Complex Activity Features Estimation}
In current cognitive health assessment literature, complex activity features can be defined as $\langle TC,SEQ,INT,TS\rangle$. We used supervised method to estimate TC, SEQ and INT, and unsupervised method to estimate TS. We first, formulate the automated scoring as a supervised  machine learning problem in which machine learning algorithms learn a function that maps $\langle${\it hand gesture, posture, object, ambient sensor}$\rangle$ feature set to the direct observation scores. We use bagging ensemble method to learn the mapping function and SMO based SVM \cite{cao06} as base classifier. The learner averages by boostrapping individual numeric predictions to combine the base classifier predictions and generates an output for each data point that corresponds to the highest-probability label. We train three classifiers considering observation as ground truth for TC, SEQ and INT scores and test on the testing dataset. We derive unsupervised scores using dimensionality reduction technique for each feature set. First, we take all features of each activity, apply optimal discriminant analysis technique as a dimensionality reduction process \cite{zhang09} and reduce the feature sets into single dimensional value which represents the automated task completeness scores of the particular user activity. A min-max normalization is applied that provides us a uniform range of the variables using $
z_i=\frac{x_i-min(x)}{max(x)-min(x)}$ equation where $x=\{x1,\ldots,x_n\}$ and $z_i$ is $i^{th}$ normalized data. The final single dimensional score represents machine learning based TS score.
\section{Physiological Sensor Signals Processing}
The autonomic nervous system (ANS) restrains the body's physiological activities including the heart rate, skin gland secretion, blood pressure, and respiration. The ANS is divided into sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) branches. While SNS actuates the body's resources for action under arousal conditions, PNS attenuates the body to help regain the steady state. Mental arousal (say stress, anxiety etc.) activates the sweat gland causing the increment and reduction of  Skin Conductance on SNS and PNS physiological conditions respectively. However, Instant Heart Rate also has similar effect on SNS and PNS physiological condtions i.e., a higher value of heart rate is the effect of SNS and lower value is the outcome of PNS. EDA and PPG sensors are widely used to estimate the instant value of skin conductance and heart rate respectively \cite{alam16}.
\subsection{EDA Sensor Signal Processing}
EDA is the property of the human body that causes continuous variation in the electrical characteristics of the skin which varies with the state of sweat glands in the skin. There are three types of arousal: \emph{cognitive, affective and physical}. \emph{Cognitive} arousal occurs when a person tries to solve any problem using her cognitive ability. \emph{Affective} arousal occurs when a person is worried, frightened or angry either doing daily activities or in resting position. On the other hand, \emph{physical} arousal is related to the brain command to move bodily parts which is imposed on the total arousal as an artifact, called \emph{motion artifact}. However, there are always some noises due to the weather conditions (temperature, humidity etc.) and device motion. This \emph{motion artifact} can be the prime cause of signal contamination of physiological outcomes while performing daily activities which must be removed. \emph{AutoCogniSys} proposes an EDA sensor signal processing method consists of three steps: (i) noise and motion artifacts removal, (ii) separation of tonic component and phasic component (explained later) from contamination free EDA signal and (iii) feature extraction on the response window.
\subsubsection{Motion Artifacts Removal}
There are many types of motion artifacts but the unsual steep rise is the mostly occured ones associated with EDA signal while performing daily activities \cite{edel67}. We use well-known steep rising noises reduction technique, SWT \cite{chen15}. We first consider EDA signal as a mixture of a slow variant tonic and fast variant phasic component, i.e., SWT coefficient is modeled as a mixture of two Gaussian components, phasic (close to zero valued signal) and tonic (high rising signal). After expanding EDA signal into multiple levels of scaling and wavelet coefficients, we choose adaptively a threshold limit at each level based on the statistical estimation of the wavelet coefficients' distribution, and employ that on the wavelet coefficients of all levels. Finally, an inverse wavelet transform technique is applied to the thresholded wavelet coefficients to obtain the artifacts free EDA signal. Fig~.\ref{fig:eda_artifact_removal} shows a sample of raw and motion artifacts free EDA signal.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\vspace{-.1in}
   \epsfig{file=eda_signal_artifact.pdf,height=1.6in, width=3.5in}
\caption{Dashed line represents noisy EDA signal and solid red line represents \emph{AutoCogniSys} proposed motion artifact free EDA signal}
   \label{fig:eda_artifact_removal}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Convex Optimization Technique to EDA Deconvolution}
After the motion artifact removal, we consider EDA as the sum of three components for $N$ sample: a slow tonic driver ($t$), fast (compact, bursty) non-negative sparse phasic driver ($r$) and a reminder error term ($\epsilon_r$).
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eda_signal}
y = t + r + \epsilon_r
\end{equation}
This additive error $\epsilon_r$ is a White Gaussian Noise. The central problem associated with the deconvolution method is to get tonic $t$ component from the above equation. \cite{greco16} showed that EDA signal deconvolution (separation of tonic, phasic and noise terms from EDA signal) is a quadratic optimization problem and defined tonic component as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tonic}
t = Bl + Cd,
\end{equation}
where $B$ is a tall matrix whose columns are cubic $B$-spline basis functions, $l$ is the vector of spline coefficients, $C$ is a $N\times 2$ matrix, $d$ is a $2\times 1$ vector with the offset and slope coefficients for the linear trend. The above equation is subject to the following optimization problem,
\begin{eqnarray}
minimize \frac{1}{2} {||Mq + Bl + Cd- y||}^2_2 +\alpha {||Aq||}_1 + \frac{\lambda}{2} {||l||}^2_2\\
subject\;to\; Aq \geq 0\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $M$ and $A$ are tridiagonal matrices and $q$ is an auxiliary variable. After solving the above equation, we can get the optimal values for $\{q,l,d\}$ that can be used to obtain tonic component from the equation~\ref{eq:tonic}. The reminder of the equation~\ref{eq:eda_signal} ($r+\epsilon_r$) is considered as a mixture of White Gaussian Noise ($\epsilon_r$) and a fast variant phasic component ($r$). We employ butterworth low-pass filter (5Hz) and hanning smoothing with window size 4 (optimal) to remove $\epsilon_r$ from phasic component ($r$).
\subsection{PPG Signal Processing}
PPG is used mainly for measuring the oxygen saturation in the blood and blood volume changes in skin. An ideal PPG signal processing must contain the following steps: noise and motion artifacts removal, heart rate detection, heart rate variability estimation and feature extraction.
\subsubsection{PPG Signal Noise and Motion Artifacts Removal}
Similar to EDA signal, PPG signal is also contaminated with motion artifacts and noises. However, unlike EDA signal, PPG produce quasiperiodicity in a time series spectrum \cite{mete30}. We use Periodic Moving Average Filter (PMAF) to remove motion artifacts and noises \cite{lee07}. We first segment the PPG signal on periodic boundaries and then average the $m^{th}$ samples of each period. After filtering the input PPG signal with a 5-Hz $8^{th}$-order Butterworth low-pass filter, we estimate the maximum and minimum value of each period. The mean of each period are obtained from the maximum and minimum values applying the zero crossing method. These points of the means help determine the boundaries of each period. Then, interpolation or decimation is performed to ensure that each period had the same number of samples \cite{lee07}. 
\subsubsection{Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability Estimation}
We first apply PMAF on PPG signal to remove noises and motion artifacts, refine PPG by smoothing the signal using 1-dimensional Gaussian Filter and Convolution, calculate first derivative of the convoluted signal and finally find the differences between two consecutive peak values which is called HRV \cite{sel08}. The occurrences of total peak values (R-peak or beat) in each minute is called Heart Rate (HR) with an unit of Beat Per Minute. The signal value property of HRV and HR are inversely proportional which means the mental arousal that increases HR should decrease HRV in the time segment window. Fig~\ref{fig:ppg_artifact_removal} shows a sample of the noisy and filtered PPG signal and their corresponding Instant Heart Rate.

\vspace{-.15in}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Physiological Sensor Signal Feature Extraction}
Using the above mentioned methods, we removed the noises and motion artifacts from EDA and PPG signals and generated two time series signal from EDA (tonic and phasic components) and one time series signal from PPG (HRV). Then, we segment each of the time series signal based on our prior detected complex activities such that each response window starts and ends with the starting and ending points of each complex activity. We extract 7 statistical time-series features for EDA (as shown in Table~\ref{tab:eda_features}) and 8 features for HRV (Table~\ref{tab:hrv_features}) within the response window).

\section{Experimental Evaluation}
In this section, we explain our data collection, available benchmark dataset, baseline methods and evaluation.
\subsection{Datasets and Baseline Methods}
We validate and compare \emph{AutoCogniSys} with baseline methods on both publicly available and our collected datasets.
\subsubsection{RCC Dataset: Collection and Ground Truth Annotation}
For collecting Retirement Community Center Dataset (RCC Dataset), we recruited 22 participants (19 females and 3 males) with age range from 77-93 (mean 85.5, std 3.92) in a continuing care retirement community with the appropriate institutional IRB approval and signed consent. The gender diversity in the recruited participants reflects the gender distribution (85\% female and 15\% male) in the retirement community facility. A trained gerontology graduate student evaluator completes surveys with participants to fill out the surveys. Participants are given a wrist band to wear on their dominant hand, and concurrently another trained IT graduate student have the IoT system setup in participants' own living environment (setup time 15-30 minutes). The participants are instructed to perform 13 \emph{complex ADLs}. Another project member remotely monitors the sensor readings, videos and system failure status. The entire session lasts from 2-4 hours of time depending on participants' physical and cognitive ability.

We follow the standard protocol to annotate demographics and activities mentioned in the IRB. Two graduate students are engaged to annotate activities (postural, gestural and complex activity) whereas the observed activity performances are computed by the evaluator. Two more graduate students are engaged to validate the annotations on the videos. In overall, we are able to annotate 13 complex activities (total 291 samples) labeling for each participant; 8 hand gestures (total 43561 samples) and 4 postural activities (total 43561 samples) labeling. Annotation of postural and complex activities outcomes no difficulties from recorded videos. However, annotation of hand-gestures is extremely difficult in our scenario. We used video based hand tracker that can track and sketch wrist movements from a video episode \cite{hugo14}. This sketching can help us significantly to identify which particular hand gesture is being performed in the time segment.
\subsubsection{EES Datasets: EDA and PPG Sensor Datasets}
We used Eight-Emotion Sentics (EES) dataset to validate \emph{AutoCogniSys} proposed physiological signal processing approaches \cite{picard01}. The dataset consists of measurements of four physiological signals (PPG/Blood Volume Pulse, electromyogram, respiration and Skin Conductance/EDA) and eight affective states (neutral, anger, hate, grief, love, romantic love, joy, and reverence). The study was taken once a day in a session lasting around 25 minutes for 20 days of recordings from an individual participant. We consider only PPG and EDA for all of the affective states in our study.
\subsubsection{Baseline Methods}
Though no frameworks ever combined all modalities together into real-time automated cognitive health assessment, we evaluate \emph{AutoCogniSys} performance by comparing the performances of its components individually with upto date relevant works. For hand gesture and postural activity recognition, we consider \cite{alam17} proposed method as baseline. For complex activity recognition, we compare our hand gesture and postural activity classifiers aided HDBN model with three-level Dynamic Bayesian Network \cite{zhu12} framework. For activity performance estimation, activity performance based cognitive health assessment; and EDA and PPG based cognitive health assessment, we have considered \cite{alam16} proposed method as baseline.
\subsection{Activity Recognition Evaluation}
The standard definition for \emph{accuracy} in any classification problem is $\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$ where $TP,TN,FP$ and $FN$ are defined as true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative. For complex activity recognition evaluation, we additionally consider \emph{start/end duration error} as performance metric that can be explained as follows: consider that the true duration of ``cooking'' is 30 minutes (10:05 AM - 10:35 AM) and our algorithm predicts 29 minutes (10.10 - to 10.39 AM). Then, the start/end duration error is 9 minutes ($|$5 minutes delayed start$|$ + $|$4 minutes hastened end$|$), in an overall error of e.g., 30\% (9/30=0.3). We measure cross-participant accuracy using leave-two-participants-out method for performance metrics, i.e., we take out two of the participants' data points from the entire dataset, train our proposed classification models, test the model accuracy on the two left-out participants relevant data points, and continue the process for entire dataset.

 \end{minipage}
\end{figure*}

Fig~\ref{fig:hand_gesture_accuracy} displays Feature Weighted Naive Bayes (FWNB) based the 8-hand gestural activity recognition accuracies comparisons with the baseline methods which clearly depicts the outperformance of our method (5\% improvement) with an overall accuracy of 92\% (FP rate 6.7\%) in RCC dataset. For postural activity recognition, dataset achieving 91\% postural activity recognition accuracy (FP rate 9.5\%) which outperforms the baseline approach significantly (8\% improvement). Now, we expand the postural activities for RCC datasets into 3 diverse `walking' postures: `normal walking', `walking with walker', `walking with single stick' and the accuracy goes down to 88\% (FP 7.9\%). Fig.~\ref{fig:posture_accuracy_normal} and Fig.~\ref{fig:posture_accuracy_extended} illustrate 4-class postural and extended 6-class postural classifier accuracies respectively which clearly posit that \emph{AutoCogniSys} outperforms in each case of postural activities as well as overall performances (8\% and 7\% improvement respectively).

For complex activity classification, we choose RCC dataset to train our HDBN model. Our leave-two-participants out method results an accuracy of 85\% (FP Rate 3.6\%, precision 84.2\%, recall 84.5\%, ROC Area 98.2\%) with a start/end duration error of 9.7\%. We run the entire evaluation for baseline complex activity recognition algorithm too achieving an overall accuracy of 78\% (FP Rate 5.2\%, precision 79.6\%, recall 78.5\%, ROC Area 82.7\%) which is clearly lower performed method than our approach. Fig. \ref{fig:complex_activity_roc} and Fig~\ref{fig:complex_activity_accuracy} illustrate the ROC curve and each complex activity recognition accuracy comparisons with baseline method which depict the outperformance of our framework over baseline methods (7\% improvement). Fig~\ref{fig:complex_activity_accuracy} also shows that inclusion of postural activity improves the final complex activity recognition (4\% improvement).

\subsection{Quantification of Performance Score}
To characterize both the qualitative and quantitative health assessment performance scores, we start with four different feature groups ranging from both functional and physiological health measures: (i) observation based activity features, (ii) automatic activity performance features, (iii) EDA features and (iv) PPG features.

In \emph{observation based activity features}, we design a complex activity set comprised of multiple subtasks which are involved with task {\it interruption, completion and sequencing}. Participants are instructed to perform the complex activities while the trained evaluator observed the aforementioned functional activity performance measures. Each incorrect attempt of performance measure will be assigned one point thus higher score reflects lower performance of functional activities \cite{dawadi14}. We first detect hand gesture and postural activities. Then, we feed the low-level activity contexts (gestural and postural) combined with ambient contexts (object and ambient motion sensor readings) into HDBN for single inhabitant model \cite{alam16b} to recognize complex activities. The complex activity recognition framework provides both activity labels and activity window (start-end points). Then, we extract features of object sensor, ambient sensor, gestural activity and postural activity events for each activity window. The features are number of occurrences, mean number of occurrences, consecutive 1, 2, 3, $\ldots$ 20 occurrences, top 10, 20, 30, $\ldots$, 90 percentile etc (29 features in total). In \emph{physiological features} we first detect 13 complex activities using HDBN algorithm which provides activity labels and activity window (start-end points), apply noise reduction, motion artifacts removal, extract 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features for each activity and take the mean of them over time (minutes) to get 15 (7+8) complex activity physiological features set for each participant. In summary, we extract 3 observation based activity features, 29 automatic activity performance features, 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features.
\subsection{Physiological Signal Processing Performance Evaluation}
Standard evaluation technique should use both experimental and publicly available datasets to confirm the outperformance of the novel approaches. We first evaluate our physiological signal processing techniques using a publicly available dataset (EES Dataset \cite{picard01}) to detect 8 human emotions. Then, in next section, we evaluate our methods in assessing cognitive health status of older adults using RCC dataset.

For EDA, we first apply SWT method to remove motion artifacts and noises. Then, we use cvxEDA method to separate tonic and phasic components of EDA. Then, we extract 7 EDA features on a sliding window of 4 seconds. Finally, we feed the 7 EDA features into a SMO based SVM algorithm \cite{cao06}. We use 10-fold cross validation to classify eight emotions achieving 87\% of overall accuracy (FP rate 6\%). For PPG, we first apply our proposed PMAF based noises and motion artifacts removal technique. Then, we calculate HRV and perform time-domain feature extraction to extract 8 HRV features on a sliding window of 4 seconds. We feed these features into a SMO based SVM algorithm \cite{cao06}. Our 10-fold cross validation shows accuracy of 79\% (FP rate 11.5\%) of detecting 8 emotions on EES Dataset. Fig. \ref{fig:ees_eda} and Fig. \ref{fig:ees_ppg} clearly depict that \emph{AutoCogniSys} proposed EDA and PPG signal processing techniques significantly improve the accuracy over the baseline \cite{alam16} method (10\% and 12\% improvement).

\subsection{Evaluation of Performance Scores}
The feature subsets used in the experimentation for observation and survey based clinical assessments and technology guided physiological and activity initiated health assessments are depicted in Table~\ref{tab:feature_subset}. From our 6 demographics surveys, we find significant distributions in terms of cognition only for SLUMS Score (S-Score). Based on that, we divide our participants pool into three groups: \emph{Not Cognitively Impaired (NCI), Mild Cognitively Impaired (MCI) and Cognitively Impaired (CI)} where the number of participants are $5$, $7$ and $10$ respectively.

\subsection{Statistical Correlation Analysis of Cognitive Health}
We used Pearson correlation coefficients with significance on $p<0.05$* for individual feature and partial correlation coefficients with significance on $p<0.005$** for group of features correlation analysis. Fig. \ref{fig:group_correlation} and Fig. \ref{fig:group_correlation_baseline} show the group correlation analysis results based on \emph{AutoCogniSys} proposed framework and baseline \cite{alam16} framework respectively. It can be clearly depicted that our proposed framework improves the correlation with the ground truths.
\subsection{Machine Learning Classification of Cognitive Health}
We evaluate using machine learning classifiers to predict cognitive status of older adults using both individual modalities and combined features. We use leave-two-participants out method to train and test classification accuracy.

We first choose the individual activity features (machine learning method based interruption scores, sequencing scores, unsupervised scores) and their combined features to train and test cognitive impairment status classification for SMO based SVM algorithm \cite{cao06}. The classification accuracies are 72\%, 69\%, 76\% and 83\% respectively. Then we consider 7 EDA-activity features and 8 HRV-activity features individually in training and testing phase of SMO based SVM algorithm \cite{cao06} resulting 85\% and 80\% accuracy respectively.

For combined classifier, we first applied sequential forward feature selection to find the best combinations of 1- 3 features for cognitive impairment classification group MCI, NCI and CI in terms of combined activity features (29 features), EDA-activity features (7 features) and HRV-activity features (8) features. Our final combined classifier (SMO based SVM algorithm \cite{cao06}) provides an accuracy of {\bf 93\%} in detecting the cognitive impairment status of older adults. Fig. \ref{fig:combined_classification} shows our proposed individual and combined methods outperform the baseline \cite{alam16} significantly (13\% improvement). Fig. \ref{fig:each_activity_cognitive_assessment} shows the cognitive impairment status prediction accuracy for each modality (activity feature, EDA and HRV) per individual complex activity.
\subsection{Discussion}
If we exclude the postural activities from automated activity performance scoring, we find reduced statistical correlation with original task completeness performance for \{NCI, MCI, CI\} participant group (INT 0.53*, SEQ 0.21' and unsupervised 0.49'). However, if we skip our proposed motion artifact removal stage, we find reduced statistical correlation with \{NCI, MCI\} and \{MCI, CI\} groups of participants (EDA and HRV correlations respectively \{0.51*, -0.51*\} and \{-0.53*,0.46\}). To test our proposed motion artifacts removal impact on EDA signals more rigorously, we choose 5 random participants, engage one expert motion artifact annotator to annotate motion artifacts segment on each participant's first 30 minutes of complex dataset using recorded video and apply both baseline and our methods to detect motion artifact segments. While baseline method achieves 75.5\% (FP rate 20.3\%) accuracy in detecting motion artifact segments, \emph{AutoCogniSys} outperforms achieving 89.9\% (FP rate 8.9\%) accuracy. In terms of experience, we have seen 100\% acceptance of wearing wrist-band,  71\% of acceptance for signing consent on using cameras and 0\% failure rate of collecting continuous data.
\section{Conclusion}
We propose, \emph{AutoCogniSys}, an IoT inspired design approach combining wearable and ambient sensors embedded smart home design, extensive signal processing, machine learning algorithms and statistical analytics to automate cognitive health assessment in terms of complex activity performances and physiological responses of daily events. Additionally, our postural activity detection approach in diverse population cum improved activity performance measurement and fundamental physiological sensor artifacts removal from physiological sensors help facilitate the automated cross-sectional cognitive health assessment of the older adults. Our efficient evaluation on each modality (physical, physiological and ambient) and each activity mode proves that any of the mode (say single activity and single sensor) also can provide significant improved cognitive health assessment measure.



",['Wearable sensors.'],7670,multifieldqa_en,en,,34f9b2c3d79ced580687f9653a6908215f79b1405a918cd0," Cognitive deficit of older adults is one of the biggest global public health challenges in elderly care. Approximately 5.2 million people of 65 and older are suffered with any form of cognitive impairments in United States in 2012. Total annual payments for health care, long-term care and hospice care for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias are projected to increase from \$259 billion in 2017 to more than \$1.1 trillion in 2050. There is no universally accepted method for IoT-assisted automatic cognitive health assessment in smart home environment that can fuse multi-modal sensor contexts altogether. However, there are many advantages to obtaining an early and accurate diagnosis when cognitive symptoms are first noticed as the root cause findings of impairment always lessen the progress of impairment status and sometimes symptoms can be reversible and cured. For validation of IoT based cognitive health Assessment, self-reported surveys, clinical diagnosis and observation based tools are used individually by prior researchers. For example, some researchers showed ambient sensors based Activities of Daily Livigin (ADLs) sequence pattern can signify the cognitive health status of older Adults. ealth assessment, \emph{AutoCogniSys} considers reproducibility of our model in any smart home system. We propose automatic complex activity recognition based on a Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Network (HDBN) model, fine-grained extraction of physiological sensor features and finally machine learning classification of cognitive impairment. We design and prototype an IoT system consisting of multiple devices (wearable wrist band, IP camera, object and ambient sensors) connected with central hub via WiFi, Ethernet and Bluetooth communication protocols. We collected data from 22 older adults living in a continuing care retirement community center in a very natural setting (IRIR) We propose a novel collaborative filter for EDA signal processing by postulating signal as a mixture of three components:  tonic phase, phasic phase and motion artifacts. We use a novel PPG signal processing technique to filter out the inherent motion artifacts and noises using improved Periodic Moving Average Filtering (PMAF) technique. We show significant improvement can be achieved in cognitive impairment classification. AutoCogniSys builds on previous works on wearable devices based low-level (postural and hand gestural) activity recognition and their integration with ambient sensors to recognize complex ADLs. We use statistical and machine learning techniques to jointly correlate the activity performance metrics and stress (EDA and PPG) features that helps achieve max. 93\% of cognitive impairment status detection accuracy. The underlying signal processing and applications on cognitive health assessment automation can be used in the future to improve the accuracy of cognitive health assessments. The study was published in the open-source journal Cogent Cognition (http://www.cogent-cognition.org/article.php?article=Cogent  Cognition and Cognitive Impairment Status Diagnosis &type=Cognition &ls=1&ls-key=1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,29-32,33,32-33,34,34-34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,59-60,61,62,63 into single-inhabitant HDBN model that provides significant improvement in complex activity recognition. We consider inclusion of an wearable wrist-band with in-built ACC sensor to detect hand gesture and posture, augmenting with the ambient sensor readings. We propose intelligent use of physiological features of skin through different physiological sensor signals (EDA, PPG) processing in daily activity tasks. We incorporate context-awareness for automation of cognitive health assessment that have not been explored before. We first investigate existing IoT-based cognitive health care frameworks that covers every aspects of wearable (physical, physiological) and ambient (passive infrared and object) sensor signals computing. We have carefully chosen the clinically proven functional and behavioral health assessment tools for this pilot study. We also have chosen clinically justified observation based behavioral assessment methods for the residents. We conclude with a discussion of the benefits and risks of using this technology in the long-term health care system for older adults.

We aim to detect single wrist-worn ACC sensor based hand gesture and postural activities and insert these into an HDBN graphical model. We consider the recognition problem asan activity tupple of gesture,posture,ambient,object. We propose to use rotational normalization method that can merge some hand-gestures subject to directional differences and forms an 8-hand gesture model. Our proposed Feature Weight Naive Bayes (FWNB) classifier adds significant improvement on Alam et. al. proposed sparse-deconvolution method as well as recognition in diverse postural environment. For example, some older adults use walker, double walking sticks or wheel chair for walking in which cases collecting 18 hand gestures and corresponding postural activity for training requires endless efforts and carefulness. For more information, visit: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/10/29/science-mag-science-hands-gesture-recognition-8.html#storylink=cpy. We are also happy to provide a link to our website, where you can see the full study and download a copy of the code for your own use. AutoCogniSys has developed a method to recognize hand gestures using rotation normalization and 4 (walking, sitting, standing and lying) postural activities. The deconvolution framework takes a known signal (hand gesture effects) and a equalizer parameter ($\lambda$) as input and provides an Approximately Sparse Factor signal (postural activity effects) as output. The system predicts the gesture type with the greatest value as the user gesture. For 3-axis ACC signals, we need to learn associated 3 equalizer parameters for each hand gesture. We then apply feature extraction and prior learned SMO based SVM classifier (SMO) to classify final postural activity. We used a light-weight and efficient technique for hand gesture recognition called Naive Bayes classifier. It is based on the similarity of feature measures of the trained gestures (0$<$weight$ <$1) and the proximity of each feature measure to the average trained feature measure of each gesture type is calculated by a normal distribution. It uses a sparse-deconvolution method (with 31\% signal reconstruction error) to get Approximately Spare Factor. We build a HDBN based complex activity recognition framework for single inhabitant scenario smart home environment. We take advantage of detected hand gestural and postural activities along with the ambient and object sensor streams. We infer the most-likely sequence of complex activities (and their time boundaries), utilizing the well-known Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for training and the Viterbi algorithm for run-time inference. Our behavioral scientist team, comprises with Nursing professor, gerontologist and retirement community caregivers, carefully discus, optimize and choose 87 sub-tasks in total for 13 complex activities. The final goal of activity features estimation is to provide overall task score. The task score is proportional to the functional ability of participants in performance daily activities. We first, formulate the automated scoring as a supervised  machine learning problem in which machine learning algorithms learn a function that maps the hand gesture, posture, object, ambient sensor feature set to the direct observation scores. We use bagging ensemble method to learn the mapping function and SMO based SVM as base classifier. The learner averages by boostrapping.ng ASF signal of walking. individual numeric predictions to combine the base classifier predictions and generates an output for each data point that corresponds to the highest-probability label. We train three classifiers considering observation as ground truth for TC, SEQ and INT scores and test on the testing dataset. We derive unsupervised scores using dimensionality reduction technique for each feature set. The final single dimensional score represents machine learning based TS score. EDA sensor signal processing method consists of three steps: (i) noise and motion artifacts removal, (ii) separation of tonic component and phasic component (explained later) from contamination free EDA signal and (iii) feature extraction on the response window. We use well-known steep rising noises reduction technique, SWT. We first consider EDA signals as a mixture of a slow variant tonic and fast variant ph asic component, i.e., SWT coefficient is modeled as a mix of two Gaussian components, phasIC (close to zero valued signal) and tonic (high rising signal). After expanding EDA. signal into multiple levels of scaling and wavelet coefficients, we choose adaptively a threshold limit at each level based on the statistical estimation of the wavelet. distribution, and inverse wavelet coefficient of all levels. EDA signal deconvolution (separation of tonic, phasic and noise terms from EDA signal) is a quadratic optimization problem. We employ butterworth low-pass filter (5Hz) and hanning smoothing with window size 4 (optimal) to remove the tonic component from the noise. PPG Signal Processing is used mainly for measuring the oxygen saturation in the blood and blood volume changes in skin. An ideal PPG signal processing must contain the following steps: noise and motion artifacts removal, heart rate detection, variability estimation and feature extraction. We use the Periodic Moving Average Filter (PMAF) to first remove the first segment of the PPG signals. Then the interpolation is performed to ensure that the same number of samples had the same mean number of each period. After each period, we estimate the maximum and minimum value of each mean value of the input signal with a 5-Hz low-order filtering filter with a window size of 4. We then determine the maximum values and minimum values applying the zero crossing method and then the average samples of the first and second segments of PMAF are used to obtain the artifacts free EDA signals. For example, in the figure below, we use the thresholded wavelet coefficients to get the artifactsFreeEDA.nsform technique. R-peak or beat) in each minute is called Heart Rate (HR) with an unit of Beat Per Minute. The signal value property of HRV and HR are inversely proportional which means the mental arousal that increases HR should decrease HRV in the time segment window. We extract 7 statistical time-series features for EDA and 8 features for HRV within the response window. Then, we segment each of the time series signal based on our prior detected complex activities such that each response window starts and ends with the starting and ending points of each complex activity. We validate and compare and compare our methods with baseline methods on both publicly available and publicly available datasets. We conclude with an evaluation of our data collection, available benchmark dataset, and baseline evaluation methods. We hope that this will help you understand how to use the data to improve your retirement planning and decision-making. We are happy to help you with any questions you may have about the data collection and evaluation methods that we have used in this study. We would like to hear from you if you have any questions about this study or any other aspect of the study. Please contact us at [email protected] and we will try to answer them as soon as possible. Back to the page you came from. The study was published in the online version of this article. We used Eight-Emotion Sentics (EES) dataset to validate physiological signal processing approaches. The study was taken once a day in a session lasting around 25 minutes for 20 days of recordings from an individual participant. We used video based hand tracker that can track and sketch wrist movements from a video episode. For complex activity recognition, we compare our hand gesture and postural activity classifiers aided HDBN model with three-level Dynamic Bayesian Network framework. We measure cross-participant accuracy using leave-two-participants-out method for performance metrics, i.e. we take out two of the participants' data points from the entire dataset. We train our proposed classification models, test the model accuracy on the two left-out participants relevant data points, and continue the process for entire dataset, which is called Bayes' Bayes method. We consider only PPG and EDA for all of the affective states in our study. We evaluate performance by comparing the performances of its components individually with upto date relevant works. For activity performance estimation, we have considered EDA and PPG based cognitive health assessment as baseline. Curacy comparisons with baseline approaches (graphical signatures of all hand gestures are shown) For postural activity recognition, dataset achieving 91\% posturalactivity recognition accuracy (FP rate 9.5\%) which outperforms the baseline approach significantly (8\% improvement) For complex activity classification, we choose RCC dataset to train our HDBN model. We run the entire evaluation for baseline complex activity recognition algorithm too achieving an overall accuracy of 78\% (FP Rate 5.2\%, precision 79.6\%, recall 78.5’%, ROC Area 82.7’%) which is clearly lower performed method than our approach. Inclusion of postural activities improves the final complexactivity recognition (4’% improvement), and the accuracy goes down to 88’s (FP 7.9’%), Fig.~\ref{fig:posture_accuracy_normal.pdf, height=1.6in, width=2.1in) and Fig. “AutoCogniSys” outperforms in each case of posturally activities as well as overall performances (8”% and 7 % improvement respectively) and the ROC curve and each complex activity. recognition accuracy comparisons with. baseline method which depict the outperformance of our framework over baseline methods (7 %. We first evaluate our physiological signal processing techniques using a publicly available dataset (EES Dataset) to detect 8 human emotions. Then, in next section, we evaluate our methods in assessing cognitive health status of older adults using RCC dataset. In summary, we extract 3 observation based activity features, 29 automatic activity performance features, 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features. We use 10-fold cross validation to classify eight emotions achieving 87\% of overall accuracy (FP rate 6\%). For PPG, we first apply our proposed PMAF based noises and motion artifacts removal technique. We calculate HRV and perform time-domain feature extraction to extract 8 HRv features on a sliding window of 4 seconds. We feed these features into a SMO based SVM algorithm to classify 8 emotions on EES dataset. Our 10- fold cross validation shows accuracy of 79\% (FP rates 11.5\%) of detecting 8 emotions. We find significant significant distributions in terms of cognition only for S only S surveys. We also found significant distributions for S. only for cognition only S only for older adults. We used the feature subsets used in the observation and observation-based experiments for the clinical and clinical assessments. UMS Score (S-Score) based on that, we divide our participants pool into three groups. NCI, MCI and CI represent not cognitive, mild cognitive and cognitively impaired group of population. TC, INT, SEQ, EDA and HRV represent task completeness, interruption scores, sequencing scores, electrodermal activity features and heart rate variability features. We used Pearson correlation coefficients with significance on $p<0.05$* for individual feature and partial correlation coefficients for group of features correlation analysis. We use leave-two-participants out method to train and test classification accuracy. Then we consider features individually and combined features in training and testing phase of SMO based SVM algorithm. The classification accuracy is 72%, 69%, 76% and 83% respectively. The resulting 85% and 80% accuracy respectively is compared with baseline method for cognitive impairment detection. We evaluate using machine learning classifiers to predict cognitive status of older adults using both individual modalities and combinedfeatures. We also evaluate using a machine learning method based on interruption scores and sequencing scores to test cognitive impairment status classification for SMO-based SVM algorithms. We conclude that our proposed framework improves the correlation with the ground truths. It can be clearly depicted that the proposed framework is more accurate than the baseline framework. ion to find the best combinations of 1- 3 features for cognitive impairment classification group MCI, NCI and CI in terms of combined activity features. Our final combined classifier (SMO based SVM algorithm) provides an accuracy of 93% in detecting the cognitive impairment status of older adults. If we exclude the postural activities from automated activity performance scoring, we find reduced statistical correlation with original task completeness performance. We propose an IoT inspired design approach combining wearable and ambient sensors embedded smart home design, extensive signal processing, machine learning algorithms and statistical analytics to automate cognitive health assessment.

What did the decision to base the water rates on usage reflect?,"Time to clean house in Paso Robles Home
Front Page » Time to clean house in Paso Robles
September 5, 2010 Opinion By JIM REED
I’d like to give you an update on the issue of our civil servants cramming hundreds of millions of dollars in spending down our throats after the people of Paso Robles voted down the water rate increase last November. The rate increase is being hung up in the courts by the City Attorney. What was supposed to be a quick issue to get in front of a judge, has been drug out as long as possible by the City Attorney.
Even if the courts throw out the current rate increase, I expect that our civil servants will just change a couple of words in the rate increase notice and force the same old plan on us again.
There is a real problem with the people we have hired to work for us in Paso Robles. It seems that decisions are made based on some agenda, even if it is contrary to citizens’ wishes.
City Councilmen Ed Steinbeck, Nick Gilman and Mayor Duane Picanco, on August 19th, voted unanimously to hire the same law firm employed by the City of Bell. You may have heard the recent news story about the City of Bell’s corrupt city representatives.
This law firm allowed the elected officials and City employees to pillage the General Fund for their own benefit, contrary to the rights and interests of the citizens. We are already paying several City employees $12,000 per month with equally ridiculous benefits and pensions. What does this say about our elected representatives?
I believe most residents are like me. We elect people we believe have our best interest in mind. Over the last few years I have seen that nothing is farther from the truth. The people we have elected have lost track of the fact that “the City” exists to protect and deliver services to the citizens. To them it is some all-important ideal they strive to cultivate and improve according to their agenda. They have forgotten that they are elected to represent the citizens.
We have an election coming up in November. We have the opportunity to elect some responsible, principled people to represent us. If we elect more people from within this system, we will get more of the same type of government. We need to look at where the new candidates stand. Will they lawfully represent the citizens of the city? Or, are they happy with the way things are being run?
We have stood together in the past and have made real significant changes in important matters that are going to affect our lives for years to come. There are several thousand citizens that made their voice heard on the water issue, more than enough votes to make a change in our city government.
Please come out and vote for a democratic representative governing body for Paso Robles instead of the tyrannical leadership that exists now.
Jim Reed is a longtime resident of Paso Robles.

pasoobserver – Here is something to observe and get you going in the right direction:
California Government Code Section 65584
(a) (1) For the fourth and subsequent revisions of the
housing element pursuant to Section 65588, the department shall
determine the existing and projected need for housing for each region
pursuant to this article. For purposes of subdivision (a) of Section
65583, the share of a city or county of the regional housing need
shall include that share of the housing need of persons at all income
levels within the area significantly affected by the general plan of
(2) While it is the intent of the Legislature that cities,
counties, and cities and counties should undertake all necessary
actions to encourage, promote, and facilitate the development of
housing to accommodate the entire regional housing need, it is
recognized, however, that future housing production may not equal the
regional housing need established for planning purposes.
(b) The department, in consultation with each council of
governments, shall determine each region’s existing and projected
housing need pursuant to Section 65584.01 at least two years prior to
the scheduled revision required pursuant to Section 65588. The
appropriate council of governments, or for cities and counties
without a council of governments, the department, shall adopt a final
regional housing need plan that allocates a share of the regional
housing need to each city, county, or city and county at least one
year prior to the scheduled revision for the region required by
Section 65588. The allocation plan prepared by a council of
governments shall be prepared pursuant to Sections 65584.04 and
65584.05 with the advice of the department.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the due dates for
the determinations of the department or for the council of
governments, respectively, regarding the regional housing need may be
extended by the department by not more than 60 days if the extension
will enable access to more recent critical population or housing
data from a pending or recent release of the United States Census
Bureau or the Department of Finance. If the due date for the
determination of the department or the council of governments is
extended for this reason, the department shall extend the
corresponding housing element revision deadline pursuant to Section
65588 by not more than 60 days.
(d) The regional housing needs allocation plan shall be consistent
with all of the following objectives:
(1) Increasing the housing supply and the mix of housing types,
tenure, and affordability in all cities and counties within the
region in an equitable manner, which shall result in each
jurisdiction receiving an allocation of units for low- and very low
(2) Promoting infill development and socioeconomic equity, the
protection of environmental and agricultural resources, and the
encouragement of efficient development patterns.
(3) Promoting an improved intraregional relationship between jobs
(4) Allocating a lower proportion of housing need to an income
category when a jurisdiction already has a disproportionately high
share of households in that income category, as compared to the
countywide distribution of households in that category from the most
recent decennial United States census.
(e) For purposes of this section, “household income levels” are as
determined by the department as of the most recent decennial census
pursuant to the following code sections:
(1) Very low incomes as defined by Section 50105 of the Health and
(2) Lower incomes, as defined by Section 50079.5 of the Health and
(3) Moderate incomes, as defined by Section 50093 of the Health
and Safety Code.
(4) Above moderate incomes are those exceeding the moderate-income
level of Section 50093 of the Health and Safety Code.
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, determinations
made by the department, a council of governments, or a city or county
pursuant to this section or Section 65584.01, 65584.02, 65584.03,
65584.04, 65584.05, 65584.06, 65584.07, or 65584.08 are exempt from
the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing
with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code).

To whatisup —- First of all, I reviewed AB 602 Assembly Bill. Thanks. I am sorry to inform you but AB 602 is not the LAW as you so stated in your blog. I contacted the Deputy Chief Council’s office in Sacramento handling AB 602 to confirm your misstatement of facts. You know,in the English language, It shouldn’t be so difficult to answer some simple questions with a “YES” or “NO” answer. Yet, you are reluctant to do so, but you go on and on with a thesis along with some rhetoric. I never talked about a court suit over the “water issue”, I asked YOU, not about waiting for a court decision. Maybe, you did with some other people. Also, I was not ranting about the wineries usage of water. My response to you on your vague question about “there are people not paying their fair share for their use of water”. I related, are you talking about the wineries? I am well aware that most of the wineries are outside the city limits using the same aquifer. You took my question out of context., nice try! You are just being a popinjay and rhetorical. Also, you didn’t answer another question about “what is the unit cost of water” in Templeton? as compared to Paso Robles.

I am on a well. I am sure you are capable of doing your own homework. I also am quite sure if you really contacted the Deputy Chief Counsel’s Office you have been set straight. What I gave you is a proposed small adjustment in the wide range of laws that make up the California Housing element. I assumed you could stumble onto the facts based on what I gave you. By the way, I believe you can review the Paso Robles Housing element plan on the City’s website or at the Library. The California Housing Element Laws that all cities and counties have to follow have been in place for almost 25 years. I realize you don’t actually have a clue how to look the laws up. Either educate yourself or keep making a fool of yourself, your choice. A simple Google search of California Housing Element Laws will get you going. Good Luck!
TO WHATISUP — I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT LAW YOU ARE REFERRING TO THAT SAYS “WE” THE PEOPLE HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE NEW DEVELOPMENT? AGAIN, FOR THE THIRD TIME, YOU FAILED TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS POSED TO YOU IN MY PRIOR RESPONSES TO YOU ON SEPT.10TH &11TH. IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU DON’T WANT TO ANSWER THEM? YOU DO WHAT OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS DO SO WELL, AND THAT IS “IN ONE EAR AND OUT OF THE OTHER EAR” IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU ARE EITHER EMPLOYED BY THE CITY OR YOU HAVE OTHER DEALING WITH THE CITY, SO BE IT. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT YOU THINK THE CITY DOES EVERYTHING RIGHT. APPARENTLY, YOU PRESENT YOURSELF AS BEING VERY BIAS ON CITY DECISIONS. IT LIKE THEY CAN’T DO ANYTHING WRONG ACCORDING TO YOUR LOGIC. THEY KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR THE CITIZENS OF PASO,THAT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF ARROGANCE ALONG WITH NARCISSISM.
WHAT PEOPLE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT DOESN’T PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF WATER? ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE WINERIES USING THE SAME AQUIFER?
I BELIEVE YOU RELATED THAT YOU RESIDE IN TEMPLETON, BUT YOU OWN PROPERTY IN PASO. BY THE WAY, WHAT IS THE COST PER UNIT OF WATER USAGE IN TEMPLETON COMPARED TO PASO? OF COURSE, TEMPLETON IS IN AN UNINCORPORATED AREA (COUNTY JURISDICTION).
WELL, I GAVE YOU SOME SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO PAY FOR THE NACIMIENTO WATER PIPELINE AND SEWER TREATMENT PLANT. ALSO, REMEMBER IT’S THE CITIZENS’ MONEY THAT IS BEING SPENT. WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, IS LET THE CITIZENS OF PASO DECIDE WITH THEIR VOTE ON HOW TO FINANCE THIS HUGE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT EXPENDITURE. JUST BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE PROPOSITION 218 AND STOP CIRCUMVENTING THE LAW.
WOULD YOU OBJECT TO HAVING TO FINANCE SOME NEW BONDS ON YOUR PROPERTY TAX BILL AS A ” SPECIAL TAX” OR AN ASSESSMENT TAX” TO PAY FOR THE NACIMIENTO WATER PIPELINE AND SEWER TREATMENT PLANT? A PERCENTAGE OF PASO CITIZENS FINANCE LOCAL SCHOOL BONDS ON THEIR PROPERTY TAX BILL AND DON’T HAVE ANY KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL. HOW ABOUT THAT COMPARISON FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT? WHAT SAY YOU?
I say less CapsLock, please.

I have answered your questions. I have been quite detailed in my answers and I am sorry if you can’t deal with the detail. I guess it is your inconvenient truth. You do seem to like to deflect and go around in circles. Another example, now you are ranting about the wineries using the same aquaifier as the City. Let me be clear for you, I don’t like the amount of water the wineries are using. However, the wineries are in the County, not in the City and the City can’t do anything about it. They wineries are allowed to take the water they are taking even if it drops the City’s water levels in their wells. You need to complain to Sacramento. It sounds like you just don’t want to pay anything for the infrastructure because you really just don’t want it built.
Several of your observations of my opinions are bizarre considering I have stated several times I believe the Courts need to decide if Paso Robles has, or has not followed the rules as to funding the infrastucture. Obviously, as I have stated before, if the City loses the lawsuit the infrastructure will have to be paid out of the City’s General Fund until a new method of payment is voted on by the Citizens of Paso Robles. Pretty clear.
Your idea of charging based on a special assesment rather than the amount of water a property uses means that people who use little water, but live on a more expensive property will pay more than their share, based on their water usage. In addition, how do you deal with a rental unit where the renter is supposed to pay the water bill? Your idea is inherantly unfair, but my guess is it will favor you, so you don’t care if it is unfair and other people would pay part of your share. You also have decided that since I have alternative ideas to yours I must work for, or have business with the City of Paso Robles, another attempt to deflect from the issue. However, once again, I have never worked for the City or have ever done business with the City and don’t expect to ever do business with the City. I do own property in the City which is why I pay attention. Finally, it turns out there needs to be a fix to the housing element laws, the existance of which you are questioning. As I understand it the fix to the housing elemnt laws is because of some lawsuit. This should give you all the information you need to educate yourself on the California Housing Element laws that every city and county in California has to follow:

SOURCE : California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation
Housing California DIGEST : This bill states the intent of the Legislature
in enacting this bill to modify the courts opinion in Urban
Habitat Program v. City of Pleasanton (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 1561, with respect to the interpretation of
Section 65009 of the Government Code, and revises and
clarifies statute of limitations and remedies for specified
housing related challenges.
Senate Floor Amendments of 8/20/10 revise the statute of
limitations and remedies for specified housing-related
ANALYSIS : The Planning and Zoning Law requires cities
and counties to prepare and adopt a general plan, including
a housing element, to guide the future growth of a
community. Following a staggered statutory schedule,
cities and counties located within the territory of a
metropolitan planning organization (MPO) must revise their
housing elements every eight years, and cities and counties
in rural non-MPO regions must revise their housing elements
every five years. These five- and eight-year periods are
known as the housing element planning period.
Before each revision, each community is assigned its fair
share of housing for each income category through the
regional housing needs assessment (RHNA) process. A
housing element must identify and analyze existing and
projected housing needs, identify adequate sites with
appropriate zoning to meet its share of the RHNA, and
ensure that regulatory systems provide opportunities for,
and do not unduly constrain, housing development. The
reviews both draft and adopted housing elements to
determine whether or not they are in substantial compliance
with the law. The Planning and Zoning Law and the Subdivision Map Act
also includes a number of sections governing zoning and
entitlements specifically related to housing, including:
? The Housing Accountability Act, which requires a city or
county to make one or more specified findings in order to
disapprove a particular housing development.
? A provision requiring cities and counties, when adopting
an ordinance which limits the number of housing units
which may be constructed on an annual basis, to make
findings as to the public health, safety, and welfare
benefits that justify reducing the housing opportunities
of the region. ? Density bonus law, which requires cities and counties to
grant a developer a density bonus, incentives, and
concessions when the developer proposes to include
specified percentages of affordable housing within a
development. ? The Least Cost Zoning Law, which requires cities and AB 602
counties to designate and zone sufficient vacant land for
residential use with appropriate standards to meet
housing needs for all income categories and to contribute
to producing housing at the lowest possible cost.
? A requirement that, when determining whether to approve a
tentative subdivision map, a city or county shall apply
only those ordinances, policies, and standards in effect
as of the date the developer’s application is deemed
Prior to a recent court decision, it was understood that
current law allowed a party to challenge the adequacy of a
city’s or county’s housing element at any time during a
planning period, provided that the challenger brought the
action “in support of or to encourage or facilitate the
development of housing that would increase the community’s
supply of [affordable] housing.” The challenging party was
required first to serve the city or county with a notice
identifying the deficiencies in the housing element. After
60 days or the date on which the city or county took final
action in response to the notice, whichever occurred first,
the challenging party had one year to file the action in
court. This process and statute of limitations also
applied to actions brought pursuant to the housing-related
statutes listed above. In 2006 Urban Habitat Program brought suit to challenge the
City of Pleasanton’s housing policies, including the city’s
annual cap on housing permits and the city’s cap on the
aggregate number of permissible housing units, both of
which Urban Habitat claimed were insufficient to allow the
city to meet its RHNA obligation. In 2008, the First
District California Court of Appeals issued an unpublished
decision in the case of Urban Habitat Program v. City of
Pleasanton allowing the case to proceed with respect to
some causes of action, but ruling that the challenge to the
housing element itself was time-barred. The court stated:
Although the statute does not specify the time within
which [a deficiency] notice must be given, it is our
conclusion that the statute must be interpreted as
containing a time limit within which this requirement
must be met? In sum, a party bringing a challenge AB 602
governed by section 65009, subdivision (d), has 90
days from the date a legislative action is taken or
approval is given to notify the local land use
authority of any claimed deficiencies in such an
action or approval. Its claim then accrues 60 days
after it gives this notice.
In other words, instead of being able to initiate a
challenge to a deficient housing element at any time during
the planning period, housing advocates and other interested
parties may now only initiate such a challenge by
submitting a deficiency notice within 90 days of the
housing element’s adoption.
1.Removes from the current list of city or county actions
which may be challenged pursuant to Government Code 65009
notice and accrual provisions those actions related to
the Housing Accountability Act, the Subdivision Map Act,
and the application of a Density Bonus ordinance to a
particular project, all of which are project-specific
actions. The bill maintains the ability to use these
notice and accrual provisions to challenge the adequacy
of a city’s or county’s density bonus ordinance
2.Extends lengthening the time in which a deficiency notice
may be served to cover all remaining city or county
actions described in this section of law, as opposed to
just housing element challenges. In other words, the
amendments apply the longer timeframe to serve the
deficiency notice to actions relating to the Least Cost
Zoning Law, annual limits on housing permits, and the
adequacy of a density bonus ordinance, in addition to
housing element law. 3.Provides that an entity challenging such an action in
support of affordable housing may serve the deficiency
notice up to five years after the city’s or county’s
action. After 60 days or the date on which the city or
county takes final action in response to the notice,
whichever occurs first, the challenging party has one
year to file an action in court, except that the lawsuit AB 602
may not be filed more than five years after the city’s or
county’s action. In other words, the entity must file
the lawsuit within one year of the expiration of the
deficiency notice or within five years of the city’s or
county’s action, whichever occurs first.
4.Provides that a housing element from a prior planning
period may not be challenged if the city or county has
adopted a revised housing element for the new planning
Government Code 65755 . Current law requires a court, if it
finds any portion of a general plan, including a housing
element, out of compliance with the law, to include within
its order or judgment one or more of the following remedies
for any or all types of developments or any or all
geographic segments of the city or county until the city or
county has complied with the law:
? Suspend the authority of the city or county to
issue building permits.
grant zoning changes and/or variances.
grant subdivision map approvals.
? Mandate the approval of building permits for
residential housing that meet specified criteria.
? Mandate the approval of final subdivision maps for
housing projects that meet specified criteria.
? Mandate the approval of tentative subdivision maps
for residential housing projects that meet specified
This bill clarifies that in any action or proceeding
brought pursuant to the notice and accrual provisions of
Government Code Section 65009 described above, neither the
court remedies described above nor any injunction against
the development of a housing project shall abrogate,
impair, or otherwise interfere with the full exercise of
the rights and protections granted to an applicant for a
tentative map or a vesting tentative map under specified
provisions of the Subdivision Map Act or to a developer
under a specified provision relating to development AB 602
Under current law, HCD operates a number of grant programs
to which cities and counties may apply. In many cases, the
law requires a city or county to have an HCD-approved
housing element in order to be eligible for funding. This bill provides that if a third-party challenges the
adequacy of a housing element in court and the court finds
that the housing element substantially complies with all of
the requirements of housing element law, the element shall
be deemed to be in compliance for purposes of state housing
The statutory language interpreted by the court and at
issue in this bill was added to statute by AB 998 (Waters),
Chapter 1138, Statutes of 1983, a bill sponsored by the
League of California Cities and the California Building
Industry Association. AB 998 created a short statute of
limitations period for land use decisions generally but
provided a specific exception to protect the ability to
challenge deficient housing elements. The Senate Housing
and Land Use Committee and the Senate Third Reading
analysis of the bill stated that the bill:
Specifies that for challenges in support of low- and
moderate-income housing requirements, the petitioner
shall notice local government 60 days prior to filing
action. The [one-year] statute of limitations then
begins on the first day the legislative body fails to
In the intervening 25 years prior to the Urban Habitat
ruling, housing advocates filed and successfully settled at
least ten cases in which the 60-day deficiency notice was
sent more than 90 days after adoption of the city’s or
county’s housing element. In none of these cases was the
timeliness on the advocates’ suit contested. Likewise, six
bills amended other portions of this statute during those
intervening years, and there was never any controversy
surrounding the lack of a deadline for housing advocates to
serve a deficiency notice nor any attempt to change the AB 602
statute in this regard. Current level of housing element compliance . According to
HCD’s website as of June 7, 2010, only 46 percent of cities
and counties have adopted an HCD-approved housing element
for the current planning period that began in 2005 for the
San Diego region, 2008 for the Southern California, Fresno,
Kern, and Sacramento regions, and the summer of 2009 for
the remaining areas of the state. Unlocking the private market . The purpose of housing
element law is to create opportunities for the private
housing market to function. Builders cannot build without
access to appropriately zoned land, and current land use
plans in many cities and counties in California fail to
provide sufficient opportunities to accommodate projected
population growth. The San Diego Association of
Governments’ Regional Comprehensive Plan describes this
typical California paradox in the following way:
Under current plans and policies, more than 90 percent
of [the San Diego region’s] remaining vacant land
designated for housing is planned for densities of
less than one home per acre, and most is in the rural
back country areas dependent upon scarce groundwater
supplies. And of the remaining vacant land planned for
housing in the 18 incorporated cities, only about
seven percent is planned for multifamily housing. When
taken together, the current land use plans of the 19
local jurisdictions do not accommodate the amount of
growth anticipated in our region. SANDAG’s population
forecast, which reflects the current adopted local
land use plans in the region, projects that while
population will increase by 37 percent by 2030,
housing will grow by just 30 percent. The forecast
shows that if local plans are not changed, demand for
housing will continue to outpace the supply, just as
Housing element law addresses this problem directly by
requiring cities and counties to zone land at appropriate
densities to accommodate the projected housing needs of all
income groups and to remove constraints that prevent such
sites from being developed at the allowed densities. AB 602
Cities and counties, however, are not required to build
housing because that is the role of private developers.
The law holds cities and counties accountable only for that
which they control: zoning and land use entitlements.
Without the ability to enforce housing element law, the
market’s ability to meet housing demand may well remain
locked up.

To whatisup — Thank you for your response to my comments. However, you failed to answer some of my questions that I mentioned to you. It’s almost like dealing with some City officials. They just let the public vent at their bimonthly council meetings. In my opinion, it’s difficult to deal with narcissism and arrogance. Over the years, there has been some very good input to our elected officials on how to proceed on the Nacimiento water pipeline,but it fell on deaf ears. You wanted me to answer some of your questions,but you did not answer some of my questions. Again, are you willing to subsidize new development?,Yes?or No?, are you willing to pay for a commodity that you are not receiving? Yes?or No? and another question for you. Are you willing to pay over 300% on your water bills within the five (5) year plan that the City has proposed? Also, the water rates will be subject to later increases too. By the way, I do concur with the city’s plan of “you pay for the amount of water units you use”. (748 gal=one unit). However, the higher water rates are not good for our senior citizens on fixed incomes and other struggling families in our community. My first suggestion years ago was desalination. The response was it was too expensive. Of course, now it is more expensive. I would suggest that our elected officials recall the existing bonds (The bonds can be recalled early). The City council can explain to the citizens in detail with financing of new bonds at a lower interest rate as of now for the sewer plant and Nacimiento water pipeline and present their new proposal in compliance with Proposition 218. Let the citizens of Paso VOTE on the financing bonds for their approval. Most of the citizens,that I had spoken to were not happy with the way our City Council handled the Nacimiento water pipeline project. The citizens of Paso didn’t give our City Council a “BLANK CHECK” for $176 million to spend without voter approval. I would suggest that it be a “special tax” or “an assessment” be levied on our property taxes. A percentage of those bonds can be deducted on Federal Income taxes. As it is now, a” fee” on a capital funding project is not deductible. Of course, there are homeowners would not go for this suggestion due to our poor economy. My analogy mentioned above would be, you would get something back on a “special tax” or an “assessment” verses nothing on a “fee”. What say you?

Unfortunately the law says we have to subsidize new development in California. I don’t like it, but it is the law. I know paying using the property taxes was bandied about. The argument against it was it would mean some would be paying for water they aren’t using and others could be big water users, but pay a small special assessment on their property taxes. I think the decision that was made to base it on usage was out of fairness. It seems to me if people are using water and not paying their share of the costs it is not fair. The Senior issue is very difficult. If someone is retired for twenty years is it realistic to think prices don’t go up during the 20 years of retirement. Think what prices were in 1990 compared to today. Should Seniors never have to pay for capital improvements? Paso Robles also had very low water rates. Rates that are no longer possible given the circumstances. Desalination will happen eventually. California is out of water. If you want to pay $1,000,000 a gallon there is no more allotable water of any consequence in California. The expense will be tremendous — still have to build a desalination plant, still have to build a pipeline. I don’t know if the plant has to be built along the ocean or if the salt water could be piped over to Paso Robles. If it has to be built along the ocean, Paso Robles doesn’t own land on the ocean and, in any case, the environmentalists will keep it in courts for years as they have done so for other proposed desalination plants in Southern California. Eventually necessity will force desalination past the environmentalists, but not yet.

Whatisup – On one of your previous post you made the comment you haven’t heard any of the legal suggestions for the water issue, But you obviously have. That is a good thing. So we can move the discussion ahead.
Once, again this was handled incorrectly by our city custodians from the beginning. And now here we are. The public is not supporting this very expensive, very limited benefit project. As you said, until a plan is developed that the public can support, things don’t look good.
All this discussion about the water issue has only reinforced my opinion the issue hasn’t been about water, only how the plan should be paid for. Or more specifically, to what extent do we allow our elected custodians and our un-elected GOD tzar decide which laws they will follow and which laws they will ignore. When the City GOD tzar tell citizens at a council meeting if we don’t agree with the City’s plan, then we should just sue him, and when the City Attorney explains to a citizen at a City Council meeting that she does have to respond to their questions because she does NOT work for them. When the project is voted down by the citizens and the council brings it right back up, it is clear that our elected representatives are not doing their job providing direction to their employees and listening to and representing the CITIZENS.
The subject of the original post was the need to elect different representation. I think with all the conversation made on this post, as well as the post on Cal Coast about the hiring of the new legal firm you were involved in, Supports my original opinion.",['Fairness.'],5701,multifieldqa_en,en,,8fbf0a6531d9250e6bcda0c7ba456441f6d4073bf08de826," Time to clean house in Paso Robles Home. Jim Reed: It seems that decisions are made based on some agenda, even if it is contrary to citizens’ wishes. The rate increase is being hung up in the courts by the City Attorney. We are already paying several City employees $12,000 per month with equally ridiculous benefits and pensions. We have the opportunity to elect some responsible, principled people to represent us. If we elect more people from within this system, we will get more of the same type of government. We need to look at where the new candidates stand. Will they lawfully represent the citizens of the city? Or, are they happy with the way things are being run? We have stood together in the past and have made real significant changes in important matters that are going to affect our lives for years to come. There are several thousand citizens that made their voice heard on the water issue, more than enough votes to make a change in our city government. The comments below represent the opinion of the writer and do not represent the views or policies of CalCoastNews.com. The department will determine each region’s existing and projectedhousing need pursuant to Section 65584.01 at least two years prior to the scheduled revision. The department will adopt a final regional housing need plan that allocates a share of the regionalhousing need to each city, county, or city and county. “Household income levels” are as of the most recent decennial census. AB 602 is not the LAW as you so stated in your blog. I contacted the Deputy Chief Council's office in Sacramento to confirm your misstatement of facts. You know,in the language, it’t so difficult to answer some simple questions with a “YES” or “NO” answer. Yet, you are reluctant to do so, but you go on and on with a thesis along with some rhetoric. I am sorry to inform you but AB 601 is the law, and you are wrong about it. You should have read the bill before you wrote your blog post. You are wrong, and I’m sorry to tell you that you’re wrong, too. I am well aware that most of the wineries are outside the city limits using the same aquifer. What I gave you is a proposed small adjustment in the wide range of laws that make up the California Housing element. By the way, I believe you can review the Paso Robles Housing element plan on the City’s website or at the Library. The California Housing Element Laws that all cities and counties have to follow have been in place for almost 25 years. Either educate yourself or keep making a fool of yourself, your choice. Good Luck! To Whatisup — I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT LAW YOU ARE REFERRING to THAT SAYS “WE’S THE PEOPLE HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE NEW DEVELOPMENT? AGAIN, FOR the THIRD TIME, YOU FAILED TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS POSED TO YOU IN MY PRIOR RESPONSES TO YOU ON SEPT.10TH &11TH. IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU DON’t WANT TO AnSWER THEM? YOU DO WHAT OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS DO SO WELL, AND THAT IS “IN ONE EAR AND OUT OF THE OTHER EAR” It SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU ARE EITHER EMPLOYED BY THE CITY OR YOU HAVE OTHER DEALING WITH THE CITY, SO BE IT. he City and the City can't do anything about it. They wineries are allowed to take the water they are taking even if it drops the City’s water levels in their wells. It sounds like you just don’t want to pay anything for the infrastructure because you really just don't want it built. Your idea of charging based on a special assesment rather than the amount of water a property uses means that people who use little water, but live on a more expensive property will pay more than their share. In addition, how do you deal with a rental unit where the renter is supposed to pay the water bill? Your idea is inherantly unfair, but my guess is it will favor you, so you don't care if it is unfair and other people would pay part of your share. Finally, it turns out there needs to be a fix to the housing element laws, the existance of which you are questioning. This should give you all the information you need to educate yourself on the California Housing Element laws that every city and county in California has to follow. I have never worked for the City or have ever done business with the City and don't expect to ever do businesswith the City. I do own property in the City which is why I pay attention. Housing Accountability Act requires a city or county to make one or more specified findings in order todisapprove a particular housing development. Density bonus law requires cities and counties togrant a developer a density bonus, incentives, and concessions when the developer proposes to includespecified percentages of affordable housing within a development. Least Cost Zoning Law requires cities to designate and zone sufficient vacant land for vacant land with appropriate standards to meet housing needs for all income categories and to contribute to producing housing at the lowest possible cost. In 2006 Urban Habitat Program brought suit to challenge the city of Pleasanton’s housing policies. In 2008, the First.District California Court of Appeals issued an unpublished decision in the case of Urban. Habitat program v. City of. Pleasanton allowing the case to proceed with respect to some causes of action, but ruling that the challenge to the. housing element itself was time-barred. In sum, a party bringing a challenge AB 602Governed by section 65009, subdivision (d), has 90 days from the date a legislative action is taken or approval is given to notify the local land use authority of any claimed deficiencies in such an action or approval. The bill extends the time in which a deficiency notice may be served to cover all remaining city or county actions described in this section of law. The bill maintains the ability to use these notices and accrual provisions to challenge the adequacy of a city’s or county’S density bonus ordinance. AB 602 provides that a housing element from a prior planning period may not be challenged if the city and county has adopted a revised housing element for the new planning code.

The Senate Housing and Land Use Committee and the Sena Committee on Housing have voted in favor of this bill and it is expected to be signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown in the coming weeks. The legislation was sponsored by the League of California Cities and the California Building Industry Association. Housing element law is to create opportunities for the private housing market to function. Builders cannot build without appropriately zoned land, and current land use plans in many cities and counties in California fail to provide sufficient opportunities to accommodate projected population growth. AB 602 would require housing advocates to serve a 60-day deficiency notice to local government before filing a lawsuit. Only 46 percent of cities                and counties have adopted an HCD-approved housing element for the current planning period that began in 2005 for the San Diego region, 2008 for the Southern California, Fresno, purposefullyKern, and Sacramento regions, and the summer of 2009 for the remaining areas of the state. The law holds cities  accountable only for that which they control: zoning and land use entitlements. Without the ability to enforce housing element law, the private market’s ability to meet housing demand may well remainlocked up. The bill has no Fiscal Com: No Fiscal Com.: No funding for the housing element program. It has no fiscal impact: No fiscal impact for the Housing Element Program. It will not have any impact on the state’S housing assistance program. I concur with the city’s plan of “you pay for the amount of water units you use” (748 gal=one unit).

What did Mary tell the disciples?,"A Homily from Easter Sunday, 2017.
Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look[a] into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him in Hebrew,[b] “Rabbouni!” (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”; and she told them that he had said these things to her.
Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary wept in the throws of grief. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary dragged herself out of bed after a sleepless night and walked to the tomb in a kind of trance. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary cried—scared, confused, alone. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary thought that the powers of death had the last Word. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary heard a voice in the darkness calling her name—Mary.
Throughout this Lenten season, we’ve examined the ways that the powers and principalities hold us captive—how they push us towards securing our own survival, dominating others, using God for our own agenda. We’ve seen how in Jesus’ ministry, he’s constantly in resistance mode—exposing the powers for what they really are and envisioning an alternative way of living in the world. He describes this way as “the kingdom of God,” the living water we drink so we never thirst again, the light of the world. Jesus invites those who follow him into similar acts of resistance—to free us from the power money has on us by giving it away, to choose to see ourselves as Jesus sees us, resisting the shame that says I’m not enough, to practice Sabbath that contradicts productivity, to untie the grave clothes of someone who’s hands and feet are still tied in the trappings of death.
But all Jesus’ acts of resistance had a cost. All of the times he just wouldn’t shut up, all of the crowds he attracted because he actually noticed those who were normally ignored, the powers finally said enough is enough and put an end to his resistance the only way they could guarantee silence and division—by nailing him to a tree.
Just then, she turned and saw a man the shadow of a man behind her; a man she assumed was the gardener, his face unfamiliar in the darkness. He repeated the question—“Woman, why are you crying?” Thinking that perhaps he knew what happened or worse, that he was a culprit, she begged, “Sir if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him and I will get him.” But Jesus interrupted her pleading, interrupted her desperation, and called her by name from the darkness, Mary.
Mary. He calls her name. Her name. The name that captures the particularity of her life. To the gardener, she would just be the crying woman. At other points in her life, she was the possessed woman, the woman who wasn’t enough, the woman on the outside of the group. Never nameless—but still unnamed. Never not Mary, but still, not known.
Early in the morning, while it was still dark, God defeated the powers and principalities in the ultimate act of resistance—resurrection. The grave could not contain the Lord. Even death wasn’t enough.
In the resurrection, God defeats the powers of death and shows that it’s God who has the final Word. Nothing, not even death, can keep us from being fully known by God. The powers try to have the final say on our names, our identities, the markers by which we measure ourselves, the systems that hold people captive or keep people in oppression. But Jesus calls us out of the darkness by name.
On this Easter Sunday, we hear our Risen Lord calling our names from the darkness—Jesus, the resurrected one, the name above all names, the great I am, the Prince of Peace, the alpha and omega, the light of the world. The risen Lord has spoken.
This is the name unto which you were baptized. As you come forward and mark the sign of the cross on your forehead today, hear Jesus speaking your name from the darkness and drawing you into the light.
From our worship service on the fifth Sunday of Lent, April 2, 2017.
“Is the Lord really with us or not?” “Is the Lord really with us or not?” Why did you bring us all the way from Egypt to let us die of thirst in this desert? At least in Egypt, we had water. At least in Egypt, we weren’t so thirsty. At least in Egypt, we knew what tomorrow would hold. At least in Egypt, we weren’t so thirsty.
But no, that’s not the story they give us. They are hard on their ancestors. They tell how it is. The elders who sat and wrote down these stories understood something about our bodies, who we are and how we work. After all the generations these stories passed through, they tell the truth about how quickly we forget, about how quickly we complain, about how quickly we grow thirsty, about how much we need water.
It doesn’t take long, does it. By the end of this sermon, I will no doubt feel thirsty, not from walking on hard dusty ground in the heat of the day, but just from speaking with you. Most of us wake up in the morning needing a drink. Our bodies depend on water. We cannot live without it. Thirst, then, doesn’t happen only one time. When the Israelites panicked that they had no water, they weren’t only thinking of the present moment. They knew what was coming! We need water to live! Without water, we will die! Even if we have water for today, we will need water again tomorrow! We can drink until we are satisfied, only to know that we will eventually be thirsty for more.
The gospel of John tells a story about a woman who gave up on this question all together. She moved beyond wondering if the Lord was really with her, so confident God had forgotten her that she gave up wondering at all. Born a Samaritan into a world that valued other bodies as better than her body: male bodies, Jewish bodies, even married bodies. Even after encountering Jesus, she still leaves their conversation without a name, numbered as one of many, simply called, “Samaritan woman.” She too, was thirsty. Most believe that her shame led her to drink water in the heat of the day, when no one else would be at the rocky well, when she could get a drink alone, without experiencing the stigma and stares of others. When she came to get a drink, Jesus was also at the well, thirsty himself and in need of rest and water from the long journey through Samaria.
The Israelites complaint for water sends Moses to the only one who can satisfy, the only one who can meet this need. Moses turns to God, “What should I do with these people? How can I satisfy their thirst? I’ve looked around, I’ve checked far and wide, turned the house upsidedown, looked under the seats of the car, at the bottle of every bottle, I’ve even looked for dew on the ground and under the lids of jars and there is no water to be found. Where do we go for water? Is the Lord really with us or not?
The Israelites who wrote down this story and allowed the ancestors to look like desperate complainers who doubted God and tested God, they were onto something. They knew that we are thirsty people. Jesus knew also. All who are thirsty, come! All who believe in me, drink this living water! We are desperate to feel God’s presence, to be bathed in the water of the Spirit, to know that this is not all there is, to feel a sense of belonging to the One who is greater than I. We can only make it so long in the desert, so long wandering from one trial to the next, without a drink.
And yet, Jesus also says, “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. Notice with me: not blessed are those who are righteous, but those who thirst for righteousness. Not blessed are those who are righteous, but those who thirst for righteousness. Blessed are those who thirst for relationship with God, to know God, to see God.
I wonder, “Does Jesus want us to keep wanting?” Does Jesus want us to keep thirsting? Many faithful followers of Jesus throughout history have never claimed their thirst was quenched, never fully satisfied. You know that moment when you quench your thirst, when you sigh with relief when your throat is at ease once again, that’s the opposite of how many of God’s children have described the life of faith. They describe wanting more, being satisfied at times, while knowing they will be thirsty again.
What will be waiting for you at the rock? Will the water gush out, bursting forth, covering you from head to toe with God’s presence, drenching you in hope, cleansing you from the dust that’s caked to your feet and renewing you for a new day, a new hour, a new moment basking in the presence of God?
What will be waiting for you at the rock? Will the water drip slowly, quenching your thirst for but a moment, giving you just a glimpse of God’s spirit? Will it be so hard to get the water from the rock, that you’ll have to bend down, get underneath that dripping water to try and catch a drop? Will it be just enough for you to know, if only for a moment, that God is really with you? Will it be just enough to satisfy you for this hour, but keep you coming back for more?
What will be waiting for you at the rock? What if it seems like the water has run out, like there isn’t a drop left, the way that Mother Teresa described? What then? We follow her example. She still goes to the rock, over and over again, not to get water quench her own thirst, but to relieve the thirst of God’s other children.
This post was adapted from our sermon series on Interpreting Exodus. Pastor Megan preached this sermon at Butner Federal Prison complex on August 30, 2015.
On Father’s Day 2015, we gathered for worship at the labyrinth in front of UNC hospital, having devoted the month of June to exploring the question, “What happens after we die?” Many have watched their father’s die in this place or other similar spaces. We shared in a time of both remembrance and prayer/meditation, participating in the ancient spiritual practice of walking the labyrinth. A labyrinth is a kind of maze, laid out in a circle.
Tony graciously shared the following reflections from his experience at the labyrinth on the hot June day.
It’s smaller than I expected, stark and hard‐surfaced, with no landscaping for ornamentation or shade. I don’t know what to expect from it… or from myself. But that’s part of the appeal. I stand at the entrance, hesitating, trying to clear my mind. This doesn’t work very well, so I just start walking.
Almost immediately, the path presents itself as a linear and chronological symbol of my life’s journey. Like my physical lifetime, it has a beginning and an end, with an as‐yet undetermined amount between. This could be interesting. I like it so far… although I’m insecure about my style… and unsure about proper protocol. Is someone staring at me? Do I have to meditate? How slowly should I walk? Is it better to focus my thoughts… or to simply let them come? Will I control this thing, or allow it to control me?
I begin to see each step as an increment of elapsed time, an irretrievable expenditure of life energy. I equate my initial discomfort to the natural immaturity of my childhood years. I gradually move beyond it, into metaphorical adulthood. This is much better.
Most of the path is a series of gentle arcs. These are fairly easy to maneuver, like my comfortable life. But these segments are connected by intermittent sharp turns, mostly 180‐degree switchbacks. I see these as representing significant life changes or challenges, requiring more concentration and skill to negotiate. I notice that I am executing some of these turns mechanically, and some more gracefully. I begin to anticipate upcoming turns, and try to maintain good form around each one.
I can’t see much of the path ahead, nor the end. I spend a significant amount of mental energy dealing with this uncertainty, constantly wanting to know my real‐time ratio of “distance walked” to “distance remaining”. This is a recurring distraction.
Today is Father’s Day, and my Dad is on my mind. He recently completed his well‐walked journey, and is now watching me… even if as mere metaphor… or only as an element of my own (self‐) consciousness. I feel his presence embedded in his absence. I’m aware that it’s not only my turn to walk… it’s my only turn to walk.
I think about my children, grandson, soon‐to‐arrive granddaughter, and their descendants. The familiar succession of life, death and new life seems magical, divinely‐derived, and strangely better than living forever. My role is limited, but critical. I love the part, and embrace it.
I am acutely aware that others are journeying all around me. These are friends of mine. We meet, almost brushing, as we walk. The path seems purposefully narrow, perhaps perfectly so. I suddenly understand that it is impossible to walk this close to others without being affected by them. I affect them too… seen as small adjustments in their position or posture. As we meet, I try not to encroach too much, but making sure not to pull away. I put creative energy into maintaining the perfect degree of separation between our bodies. This feels like more art than science… each friend deserving a customized approach. This closeness seems good to me.
There is a much younger walker behind me, getting ever closer. I’m clearly holding her back. Maybe this means that the younger generation wants me to hurry up and get out of their way. I remind myself not to stretch the symbolism too far… as I pick up my pace.
I now see the end of the path ahead. I have been expecting this part to be emotionally complicated, but it is not. The final section is round… large and unrestrictive… a qualitative change from the narrow linear pathway. The circle opens up to welcome me. It is easy to step into, a perfectly natural thing to do at the end of my walk. Inside the circle, I am centered… comfortable… peaceful… thankful.
16 As Jesus passed alongside the Galilee Sea, he saw two brothers, Simon and Andrew, throwing fishing nets into the sea, for they were fishermen. 17 “Come, follow me,” he said, “and I’ll show you how to fish for people.” 18 Right away, they left their nets and followed him. 19 After going a little farther, he saw James and John, Zebedee’s sons, in their boat repairing the fishing nets. 20 At that very moment he called them. They followed him, leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers.
This is a story about 4 fishermen, Simon, Andrew, James and John. It’s a normal morning at the docks. Each one of them is going about business as usual. They arrived at dawn, bundled up in the cool morning air and started work without much conversation. Simon and Andrew are working on one fishing boat and see the Teacher approaching. “Hey. There he is,” says Andrew. Jesus from Nazareth. You can’t go anywhere without hearing about him lately. What’s he doing down here?” They paddle back to shore, not wanting to miss any trouble this Jesus fellow might stir up. Simon and Andrew get the beach and Jesus comes over to talk to them. It’s like he had come there that morning just to find these two guys. Jesus didn’t say much, “Come and follow me.” Jesus invited these 2 fishermen to be his disciples, to follow after him, to walk behind him, tracing his every step.
Further down the beach, the same scene repeats. This time, Jesus walks directly up to James and John who are focused on repairing their fishing net. Jesus says the same thing to them and now all four fishermen walk behind their rabbi with no idea of what’s ahead of them.
It’s a big deal! The four normal guys, working a normal job, on a normal morning, decide to follow Jesus. Maybe you’ve wondered like I have, how is it that Simon, Andrew, James and John do it? How do they drop everything to follow Jesus? What were they thinking? How did they feel?
It’s interesting. The story doesn’t tell us. There’s nothing about how they felt. It doesn’t say they were excited, or moved, or scared, or joyful or resistant. This story about four fisherman gives us only verbs. Jesus passed alongside the Galilee Sea. He saw two brothers. He said, Come, follow. Then, Simon and Andrew left and followed. Jesus saw James and John. Jesus called them. They followed him.
This is a story about four fisherman who decided to follow Jesus.
This is also a story about fishing. I’ve been fishing been fishing three or four times. Once I realized that fishing was primarily a crack of dawn activity, I knew it wasn’t really for me. Jesus uses a kind of puzzling image about fishing. He says, “Come, follow me, and I’ll show you how to fish for people.” I don’t know about you, but this I find this to be very strange. I realized this week why his image is so confusing to me. What do you imagine when someone talks about fishing? What I imagine when I hear the word “fish” or “fishing” is a fishing pole, the rod, reel, bait, tackle box, worms, that kind of fishing. So I’ve always interpreted what Jesus said this way.
I will make you fishers of men, fishers of men, fishers of men. I will make you fishers of men, if you follow me.
The road Jesus invites these four fishermen to follow him on will mean casting a net of love and welcome to people that they do not anticipate. Jesus will cast his net into the sea of a broken world, filled with sinners, people who have messed up, people who are outsiders, who don’t belong. Jesus will stay in the homes of poor, be guilty of associating prostitutes and touching the hands of people with communicable diseases. Jesus will throw his net into the sea and invite everyone in. Jesus will eventually be arrested and executed because those in power decided his fishing net included a few too many of the wrong people. This is a story about fishing.
This isn’t only a story about four fisherman, or only a story about fishing. It’s also, and perhaps, most importantly, a story about God.
If this is only a story about four fisherman who decide to follow Jesus, the pressures on you and me! After all, aren’t we too called to follow Jesus? Called to be his disciples? Wasn’t that the invitation you first heard when you first heard about Jesus? God has called us and we must decide. Jesus wants us all to follow him, to be like him, to walk in his footsteps, to do what he does. Of course this story is about that! And they do it, don’t they? Simon, Andrew, James, John, they do it! They decide and they do follow Jesus, imperfectly at that. Still, it’s a lot of pressure, a lot of responsibility. If life becomes all about what we do for Jesus, something is missing.
If this is only a story about fishing, have some of us failed? Is it too late for us? Some of us might not be the best at fishing, not all the great about casting Jesus’ loving net to our brothers and sisters. His net is sometimes, or maybe more than sometimes, a bit more expansive than we might be comfortable with. He calls us to be like him and fish for people, and yet, sometimes we can barely get the net into the water. Perhaps for others, we aren’t even convinced that Jesus would include us in the net at all, no matter how deep into the water he goes. He can really mean me? Would his net really reach me? There’s still more to the story.
This is a story about God, who God is, how God acts, what God does. Before Andrew, Simon, James and John follow Jesus, Jesus finds them. Before they follow Jesus, Jesus comes to them! They don’t have to go searching, they have been found. Jesus saw. Jesus spoke. Jesus called. Jesus said, “Come.“ We don’t follow Jesus in order to find him, to prove our worthiness with what we do, or even by showing Jesus how big our nets are. We follow Jesus because he first came to us. He came down to the beach to meet these four fishermen. He came specifically for Simon and for Andrew, for James and for John, for you and me.
This blog post was adapted from Pastor Megan’s sermon at Butner Federal Prison on January 25, 2015.
The life of faith consists of seasons. One scholar suggests that we can categorize these seasons of life as seasons of being securely oriented, painfully disoriented, and surprisingly reoriented. These generalizations could apply to our self-acceptance, our relations to significant others, and our participation in public or private life. We might think about these seasons as passages of life, stages of growth, or even identity crises. Acknowledging where we find ourselves in a particular season can allow us to be honest about where we are at in our lives and where we are in relation to God.
The Psalms, a collection of prayers, songs, and poems addressed to God, correspond to these seasons of orientation, disorientation, and reorientation. As we read through the book, we find Psalms where the writer is full of thanksgiving to God, securely oriented in life. We also find Psalms that demonstrate disorientation, perhaps categorized by loss, transition, grief, suffering, or even anger. Finally, some Psalms are written from a perspective of reorientation, wherein the Psalmist transitions from a period of being disoriented to being reoriented in relation to God and others.
The Psalms can become our partner in prayer. Giving us words when we have none, we pray the Psalms joining with all those who have prayed them before us and all who will pray them after we are gone. As we pray the Psalms, we find permission to be utterly honest with God about our feelings and situation, free to speak openly and deeply to God about what we are experiencing. Praying the Psalms also helps us to envision God’s future when we can’t see it ourselves. Lastly, the Psalms guard us against religion or merely thinking about God. Using their words in prayer brings us into direct conversation with the living God, in language we may never have imagined would come from our lips.

Psalms of Orientation: These Psalms reflect a confident belief that the world is well ordered, reliable, and life-giving to the person of faith.
Psalms of Disorientation: These Psalms reflect the brokenness of life, when it is no longer orderly but savage. Spoken out of the depths, they are still bold acts of faith.
Psalms of New Orientation: The pit is not the end of life; there is more. New orientation Psalms reflect the surprise of new possibilities that are experienced as pure gift from God. They are full of thanks.

Joseph’s story opens in Genesis 37 and it’s a long one. Joseph was one of 11 kids, the youngest son. In Genesis 37, the story says, “Now Jacob (Joseph’s dad) loved Joseph more than any of his other sons because he was born when Jacob was old. Jacob had made for him a long robe. When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of his brothers, they hated him and couldn’t even talk nicely to him.” Sibling rivalry, jealousy, family drama—maybe a little too familiar for some of us.
Just when you want to feel bad for Joseph, show him sympathy, “Poor kid—he can’t help that he’s the favorite,” Joseph makes himself quickly unlikeable. When Joseph’s head hits the pillow at night, he has vivid dreams about the future, dreams where he rules over his brothers. In one of these dreams, he’s in the field working with his brothers. They each tie a bundle of grain together…I imagine it like a hay bail. His bail rises up, towering and floating in the air above the others, while each of his ten older brother’s bails of hay, bows down to his bail, as if he’s ruling over them like a king. What’s worse—he didn’t keep his mouth shut about his dreams. Nope. He went ahead and announced them at the dinner table. When I imagine this scene, I’m reminded of the importance of friends. He seriously needed a friend to say, “Dude, listen, you have some dreams where you’re awesome and your brothers treat you like a king. They hate you, man. Keep your dreams to yourself.” Joseph lacked such a friend, so he bragged about his dreams—that combined with his fancy North Face jacket that Daddy bought for him only and the favoritism their dad showed him, brought his brothers to plot about how they might rid themselves of this pesky brat forever.
Joseph’s brothers considered killing Joseph, but they settled on kidnapping him and selling him into slavery instead. That way, they wouldn’t have his death on their foreheads, without having to put up with him anymore. They took Joseph’s fancy coat and destroyed it, making it look like a wild animal killed Joseph. This they showed to their father, so that he would assume that Joseph was dead; their dad would never suspect they had any part in his disappearance.
Meanwhile, Joseph was taken off to Egypt where he worked as a slave. Though he did well there and followed all the rules, he became a victim for a second time, when his master’s wife accused him of a crime he didn’t commit. Over a period of 13 years, Joseph worked as a slave and spent years locked up in prison. After a series of unlikely events, some terrible and some remarkable, Joseph rose to power and became the king’s right hand man, his adviser.
With the king’s blessing and support, Joseph led his country in preparing for a famine, putting food away on reserve during seven years of plenty. When a famine struck the land, Egypt was in a good position, able to lean on the reserved food that Joseph had put away. The surrounding lands, including Joseph’s homeland, had to lean on Egypt for food or else they would starve.
Joseph shows his brother’s enormous generosity. He has them go home, pack up and move their entire family, including their elderly father Jacob to Egypt to be near Joseph. Not long after making the trip to Egypt and being reunited with his father, their father, an elderly man at this point, Jacob dies.
And the final chapter of the story opens. Jacob is dead. Their father is gone. Now what?
Realizing that their father was dead, Joseph’s brothers said, “What if Joseph still bears a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the wrong that we did to him?” 16 So they approached[b] Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this instruction before he died, 17 ‘Say to Joseph: I beg you, forgive the crime of your brothers and the wrong they did in harming you.’ Now therefore please forgive the crime of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 18 Then his brothers also wept,[c] fell down before him, and said, “We are here as your slaves.” 19 But Joseph said to them, “Do not be afraid! Am I in the place of God? 20 Even though you intended to do harm to me, God intended it for good, in order to preserve a numerous people, as he is doing today. 21 So have no fear; I myself will provide for you and your little ones.” In this way he reassured them, speaking kindly to them.
Fear is a powerful force. Fear motivates and fear paralyzes.
It’s a little funny how they phrase the words of their father. The brothers put a great deal of distance between themselves and Joseph. Instead of saying, “Our father told us to tell you…” they say, “Your father to us to tell you…” They distance themselves from Joseph and from the message that their dad supposedly gave them to pass along.
And then, they do it again. “Please forgive the crime of the servants of the God of your father,” his brothers say. They refer to themselves in third person—“the servants of the God of your father.” It’s not “our crime” that “we committed,” but the crime of these others.
Fear not only keeps them from confession, fear also keeps them from receiving forgiveness. They are scared for their lives the moment their father breathes his last, but haven’t they already been through this conversation with Joseph? At the dinner table, when Joseph revealed his identity to them, he tells them not to worry. “It’s ok. Yeah, it was awful, but look where I am! Look at how God has used me to help save those who would be starving now. I’m even saving you!” Joseph has already offered them forgiveness, but they haven’t fully received it. They haven’t believed what he’s said. Perhaps their views of themselves were so low that they didn’t see themselves worthy of forgiveness. Maybe they’ve carried the guilt for so long about what they’ve done, they fear what life will be like without it. It’s become so much an engrained part of their identity, they don’t know who they are apart from the guilt of what they’ve done. They fear receiving Joseph’s forgiveness. They fear forgiving themselves.
To the plea of the 10 brothers, to this made-up, manipulative, last cry for safety, Joseph has two responses. First, he weeps. His weeping—his display of vulnerability and emotion—causes his brothers to begin to weep also. There they are, 11 grown brothers, weeping on the floor of the house. Why did Joseph begin to weep? The story doesn’t say. Let’s notice, brothers and sisters—the road to releasing fear and offering and receiving forgiveness may not come without weeping.
Fear is a powerful force. Fear is an excellent motivator—moving us to do particular things and act in particular ways. But fear not only motivates, it can also paralyze, cause us to freeze right where we’re at, accept things for how they are. This final chapter begins with the brothers saying to one another, “What if…?” What if Joseph still bears a grudge against us…? Fear finishes the sentence, beginning in the words, “What if…?” Fear finishes the sentence. What if…he still bears a grudge against us? What if…we confess our evil to Joseph and he says that’s the end of us? What if…we ask for forgiveness and he denies it—if I say, will you forgive me, and he says, “no”?
“What if’s” sneak into our minds and hearts.
What if…I never get out of here?
What if I fail as a parent?
What if I don’t belong?
What if no one notices I’m gone?
What if I stand up for what I believe is right and it costs me my reputation?
What if I make a mistake at work and lose my job?
What if I risk opening myself up to someone and get hurt or betrayed again?
What if my body fails me?
What if I can never accept that the past can’t change?
What if I’m not worthy of God’s forgiveness or the forgiveness of those I’ve wronged?
What if I can never forgive myself?
We do not have to live in fear. We do not have to be motivated or paralyzed by it. Look at the God that we serve! Joseph explains how God has been with him. He says to his brothers, “Even though you intended to do harm to me, God intended it for good, in order to preserve a numerous people, as he is doing today.” Does this mean that God wanted or desired Joseph’s brothers to kidnap him, throw him into slavery and ruin his life to avenge their jealousy? No. God doesn’t desire that jealousy and revenge rule our lives. God doesn’t will for us to do evil or to harm other people. Rather, God is able to overcome evil and transform it. God can overcome evil! When Jesus was captured, tried as a criminal and sentenced to death, God overcame death, raising Jesus from the death.
This post was adapted from my sermon preached at Butner Federal Prison on September 14, 2014.
We were gathered at the plaza, right between the giant bull statue and the unattractive fences of a construction site. Luminary bags weighted with rice and lit candles marked the sacred space surrounding 30 of us, one to represent each person who died as a result of domestic violence the previous year in our state. The vigil began as planned, simple, but meaningful, to remember victims of this tragedy and raise awareness about the suffering that takes place behind closed doors. About halfway through the simple service, a woman stumbled into the vigil, interrupting the solemn mood without realizing that a group was gathered and someone was speaking. She stood silent for a few moments, listening to the speaker. When she realized that the speaker was talking about domestic violence, she began to interrupt, asking questions to the speaker, sharing details from her own experience with abuse. “What would you do…what would you do if…?” she cried. Then, as unexpectedly as she joined us and as abruptly as her interruption, she began to weep, uncontrollably crying for the rest of the vigil. A couple of women gathered around her and held her as she wept. Before long, it was my turn to pray. I barely got the words out…I could hardly project my shaking voice over her loud sobs.
“Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted,” Jesus proclaims in the second line of the beatitudes. Blessed are those who mourn. How is this weeping woman, this victim of abuse, blessed? She mourns the injustices she’s experienced, her suffering, the ways her life has been shaped by pain and her inability to free herself from her oppression. Jesus says that this woman and all her sisters and brothers that mourn with her are blessed.
The Jewish culture that Jesus was born into has a rich history of mourning or practicing lament, stretching back hundreds of years before he was born. The prophets and the Psalms include poems, songs, and speeches, recounting the words of people gathered together for public mourning. This mourning wasn’t a kind of crying about having a bad day or because of a frustration at home or work. The mourning Jesus is referencing is the kind of mourning that is a response to injustice and oppression, those who mourn the impact of the powers, both material and spiritual, on the lives of the most vulnerable.
Blessed are those who mourn. Another beatitude and another paradox. Once again, Jesus’ words are outlandish and nonsensical. How is it that those who mourn are blessed? Aren’t those who are happy and fulfilled, aren’t they the ones that are blessed? Yet, in this beatitude, in this paradox, Jesus once again exposes the powers and envisions an alternative. Jesus exposes the powers that cause people to mourn in the first place, those who experience unjust suffering and loss, the same injustices that cause people to be poor in spirit. It’s these people, the mourners, that are blessed, Jesus says. These are the people that Jesus came for. In God’s empire, mourners are not written off or ignored as uncivilized, uneducated, or badly behaved. Instead, in God’s empire, they are the ones who receive God’s comfort and consolation; God’s hears their cries.
Our culture tends to restrict mourning or public displays of emotion to something appropriate for home life or private time. Further, spending time in mourning may be quickly relegated to a waste of time or an inactive posture. The expression, “Don’t just cry about it, do something,” illustrates this clearly. But mourning is not a useless waste of time or an inactive practice. Mourn is a verb. In fact, mourning elicits action and engagement. Mourning exposes the powers, shows their true colors. Seeing people in mourning is disorienting. It interrupts the lives we lead that are detached from suffering and injustice, forcing us to take another look, to pause, to listen, and to join.
The woman who interrupted our solemn vigil for victims of domestic violence exposed the powers with her loud wailing. She made me feel uncomfortable, like I wanted to look away and get away from her as quickly as possible. And yet, her cries made it impossible for me to forget her. The sound of her weeping echoed in my ears for weeks following and if I try, I can still hear them now, over nine months later. Her mourning moves me to engage in seeking justice for others who have suffered like she has.

Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look[a] into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. He interrupted her, pleading, and called her by name from the darkness, Mary. To the gardener, she would just be the possessed woman who wasn’t enough, the woman on the outside of the group. Never nameless—but still unnamed. Never not Mary, but still not known, but not known. God defeated the powers and principalities in the ultimate act of resistance—recturresurrecting the group in the name of Jesus. The power of death had the last Word. In the resurrection, God defeats the powers of death and shows that it’s God who has the final Word. Nothing, not even death, can keep us from being fully known by God. The powers try to have the final say on our names, our identities, the markers by which we measure ourselves. But Jesus calls us out of the darkness by name. As you come forward and mark the sign of the cross on your forehead today, hear Jesus speaking your name from the darkness and drawing you into the light. The grave could not contain the Lord. Even death wasn’t enough. On this Easter Sunday, we hear our Risen Lord calling our names from the dark. The risen Lord has spoken. The name above all names, the great I am, the Prince of Peace, the alpha and omega, the light of the world. We need water to live! Without water, we will die! Even if we have water for today,. we will need water again tomorrow! We can drink until we are satisfied, only to know that we will eventually be thirsty for more. We cannot live without it. Our bodies depend on water. Most of us wake up in the morning needing a drink. Pastor Megan preached this sermon at Butner Federal Prison complex on August 30, 2015. Tony graciously shared the following reflections from his experience at the labyrinth on the hot June day. Tony: “What will be waiting for you at the rock? Will the water drip slowly, quenching your thirst for but a moment, giving you just a glimpse of God’s spirit? Will it be just enough to satisfy you for this hour, but keep you coming back for more? What if it seems like the water has run out, like there isn’t a drop left, the way that Mother Teresa described? What then? We follow her example. She still goes to the rock, over and over again, not to get water quench her own thirst, but to relieve the thirst of God's other children’” “I see each step as an increment of elapsed time, an irretrievable expenditure of energy,” said Tony. “Like my physical lifetime, it has a beginning and an end, with an as‐yet undetermined amount between.”“I like it so far… although I’m insecure about proper protocol. How do I walk? Is it my style?” The author walks a path through his life. The path is filled with sharp turns, requiring concentration and skill to negotiate. The final section is large and unrestrictive, a qualitative change from the narrow linear pathway. The circle opens up to welcome the author, who is centered, peaceful and thankful. The author's role is limited, but critical. The familiar succession of life, death and new life seems magical, divinely‐derived, and strangely better than living forever. This is a story about 4 fishermen, Simon, Andrew, James and John. It’s a normal morning at the docks. Each one of them is going about business as usual. They arrived at dawn, bundled up in the cool morning air and started work without much conversation. Simon and Andrew are working on one fishing boat and see the Teacher approaching. “Hey. There he is,” says Andrew, “You can’t go anywhere without hearing about him.” They paddle back to shore, not wanting to miss him. Jesus comes over to talk to them just to find these two guys just to get the beach. This is a story about four fisherman who decided to follow Jesus. Jesus uses a kind of puzzling image about fishing. He says, “Come, follow me, and I’ll show you how to fish for people.” The road Jesus invites these four fishermen to follow him on will mean casting a net of love and welcome to people that they do not anticipate. Jesus will cast his net into the sea of a broken world, filled with sinners, people who have messed up, and people who are outsiders, who don’t belong. He will stay in the homes of poor, be guilty of associating prostitutes and touching the hands of people with communicable diseases. And he will eventually be arrested and executed because those in power decided his fishing net included a few too many of the wrong people. If life becomes all about what we do for Jesus, something is missing. Some of us might not be the best at casting Jesus’ loving net to our brothers and sisters. His net is sometimes, a bit more expansive than we might be comfortable with. He calls us to be like him and yet, sometimes we can barely get into the water for others, no matter how deep into the net at all. The life of faith consists of seasons. Acknowledging where we find ourselves in a particular season can allow us to be honest about where we are in relation to God. The Psalms correspond to these seasons of orientation, disorientation, and reorientation. Praying the Psalms helps us to envision God’s future when we can’t see it ourselves. Using their words in prayer brings us into direct conversation with the living God, in language we may never have imagined would come from our lips.

The Psalm of Joseph tells the story of Joseph, the youngest son of Jacob and his brothers. Joseph was taken off to Egypt where he worked as a slave. After a series of unlikely events, some terrible and some remarkable, Joseph rose to power and became an adviser to the king of Egypt. Joseph and his brothers were told by their father to forgive Joseph for their wrongs. Joseph wept when they spoke to him, and they fell down before him. The brothers put a great deal of distance between themselves and Joseph. Fear is a powerful force. Fear motivates and fear paralyzes, and it can cause us to accept things for how they are. It’s not “our crime” that “we committed,” but the crime of these others. Joseph has already offered them forgiveness, but they haven’t fully received it. Perhaps their views of themselves were so low that they didn't see themselves worthy of forgiveness. The road to releasing fear and offering and receiving forgiveness may not come without weeping. It's a long way from “What if…he still bears a grudge against us?” What if we confess our evil, he says to Joseph, and he says “I’m even saving you!” It is the final chapter of the story of Joseph and his 11 brothers. It begins with the brothers saying to one another, ‘What if one of us still bears an evil grudge?’ It ends with the words, � “what if…” “We are here as your slaves.” The Jewish culture that Jesus was born into has a rich history of mourning or practicing lament, stretching back hundreds of years before he was born. Jesus is referencing the kind of mourning that is a response to injustice and oppression. God doesn’t desire that jealousy and revenge rule our lives. Rather, God is able to overcome evil and transform it. God can overcome evil! When Jesus was captured, tried as a criminal and sentenced to death, God overcame death, raising Jesus from the death. Jesus says that this woman and all her sisters and brothers that mourn with her are blessed. Once again, Jesus’ words are a paradox. They are outlandish and another beatitude and another paradox. We do not have to live in fear. We don't have to be motivated or paralyzed by it. It’s OK to ask for forgiveness and he denies it, and he says, “no”? “What if…I never get out of here?” ‘What if I fail as a parent? ‘ ‘’ ‘If I can never forgive myself?’‘‘If no one notices I’m gone? ’ Our culture tends to restrict mourning or public displays of emotion to something appropriate for home life or private time. Spending time in mourning may be quickly relegated to a waste of time or an inactive posture. Mourn is a verb. In fact, mourning elicits action and engagement. Mourning exposes the powers, shows their true colors. Seeing people in mourning is disorienting. It interrupts the lives we lead that are detached from suffering and injustice, forcing us to take another look, to pause, to listen, and to join in. The woman who interrupted our solemn vigil for victims of domestic violence exposed the powers with her loud wailing."

abstract

During the patient's hospitalization, the physician must record daily observations of the patient and summarize them into a brief document called ""discharge summary"" when the patient is discharged. Automated generation of discharge summary can greatly relieve the physicians' burden, and has been addressed recently in the research community.
Most previous studies of discharge summary generation using the sequenceto-sequence architecture focus on only inpatient notes for input. However, electric health records (EHR) also have rich structured metadata (e.g., hospital, physician, disease, length of stay, etc.) that might be useful. This paper investigates the effectiveness of medical meta-information for summarization tasks.
We obtain four types of meta-information from the EHR systems and encode each meta-information into a sequence-to-sequence model. Using Japanese EHRs, meta-information encoded models increased ROUGE-1 by up to 4.45 points and BERTScore by 3.77 points over the vanilla Longformer. Also, we found that the encoded meta-information improves the precisions of its related terms in the outputs.
Our results showed the benefit of the use of medical meta-information.

INTRODUCTION

Clinical notes are written daily by physicians from their consults and are used for their own decision-making or coordination of treatment. They contain a large amount of important data for machine learning, such as conditions, laboratory tests, diagnoses, procedures, and treatments. While invaluable to physicians and researchers, the paperwork is burdensome for physicians , .
Discharge summaries, a subset of these, also play a crucial role in patient care, and are used to share information between hospitals and physicians (see an example in Figure ). It is created by the physician as a summary of notes during hospitalization at the time of the patient's discharge, which is known to be very time-consuming.
Researchers have begun to apply automatic summarization techniques to address this problem - . Previous studies used extractive or abstractive summarization methods, but most of them focused on only progress notes for inputs. Properly summarizing an admission of a patient is a quite complex task, and requires various meta-information such as the patient's age, gender, vital signs, laboratory values and background to specific diseases.
Therefore, discharge summary generation needs more medical meta-information, than similar but narrower tasks such as radiology report generation. However, what kind of meta-information is important for summarization has not been investigated, even though it is critical not only for future research on medical summarization but also for the policy of data collection infrastructure.
In this paper, we first reveal the effects of meta-information on neural abstractive summarization on admissions. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder transformer with an additional feature embedding layer in the encoder (Figure ). Hospital, physician, disease, and length of stay are used as meta-information, and each feature is embedded in the vector space.
For experiments, we collect progress notes, discharge summaries and coded information from the electronic health record system, which are managed by a largest multi-hospital organization in Japan. Our main contributions are as follows: • We found that a transformer encoding meta-information generates higher quality summaries than the vanilla one, and clarified the benefit of using meta-information for medical summarization tasks.
• We found that a model encoding disease information can produce proper disease and symptom words following the source. In addition, we found that the model using physician and hospital information can generate symbols that are commonly written in the summary. • We are the first to apply the abstractive summarization method to generate Japanese discharge summaries.
In the studies of summarization of medical documents, it is common to retrieve key information such as disease, examination result, or medication from EHRs - . Other researchs more similar to our study targeted to help physicians get the point of medical documents quickly by generating a few key sentences - .
Studies generating contextualized summaries can be categorized by the type of model inputs and architectures. Some studies produced a whole discharge summary using structured data for input - The sensitivity of the gram stain for bacterial meningitis is about 60%, and the sensitivity of the culture is not high either.
Also, the glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid would have been slightly lower. Although no definitive diagnosis could be made, bacterial meningitis was the most suspicious disease. The causative organism was assumed to be MRSA, and vancomycin and meropenem (meningitis dose) were used to cover a wide range of enteric bacteria.
a whole discharge summary from free-form inpatient records - . The free-form data is more challenging since it is noisier than structured data. In inputting of the free-form data, extractive summarization methods, which extract sentences from the source, are commonly used , - . On the other hands, an encoder-decoder model was used for abstractive summarization , , with a limited number of studies.
The various issues in the abstractive generation of discharge summary would be studied in the future. Studies using medical meta-information have long been conducted on a lot of tasks - . In abstractive summarization on discharge summary,  developed a model incorporating similarity of progress notes and information of the record author.
They presented an idea of integrating meta-information into the abstractive summarization model on medical documents, but did not reveal how meta-information would affect the quality of the summaries. Our method is based on the encoder-decoder transformer model. The transformer model is known for its high performance and has been widely used in recent studies, thus it is suitable for our purpose.
As shown in Figure , the standard input to a transformer's encoder is created by a token sequence T = [t 0 , t 1 , ..., t i ] and position sequence P = [p 0 , p 1 , ..., p i ], where i is the maximum input length. The token and position sequences are converted into token embeddings E T and positional embeddings E P by looking up the vocabulary tables.
The sum of E T and E P is input into the model. In this paper, we attempt to encode meta-information to feature embeddings. We follow the segment embeddings of BERT and the language embeddings of XLM , which provide additional information to the model. It is not a new idea but is suitable for our validation.
Our method is formulated as follows: Let M be feature type, M ∈ {Vanilla, Hospital, Physician, Disease, Length of stay}, since we set five types of features. Feature embeddings E M is created by looking up the feature table where m j is featue value (e.g., pysician ID, disease code, etc.) and |M | is the maximum number of differences in a feature.
In our study, |M | is set to four different values depending on features. Specifically, they are as follows. a) Hospital: As shown in Table , the data includes five hospital records. They were obtained mechanically from the EHR system. b) Physician: Physicians are also managed by IDs in the EHR systems. We hashed the physician IDs into 485 groups containing 10 people each.
Specifically, as a naive strategy, we shuffled and listed the cases within each hospital, and hashed them into groups in the order of appearance of the physician IDs. So each group has the information about the relevance of the hospitals. The reason for employing a grouping strategy is described in Appendix A.
c) Disease: Two types of disease information exist in our EHRs: disease names and disease codes called ICD-10 . We did not use any disease names in the inputs for our experiment. Instead, we encoded diseases with the first three letters of the ICD-10 code, because they represent well the higher level concept.
The initial three letters of the ICD-10 codes are arranged in the order of an alphabetic letter, a digit, and a digit, so there are a total of 2,600 ways to encode a disease. In our data, some ICD-10 codes were missing, although all disease names were systematically obtained from the EHR system. For such cases, we converted the disease names into ICD-10 codes using MeCab with the J-MeDic (MANBYO 201905) dictionary.
Also, diseases can be divided into primary and secondary diseases, but we only deal with the primary diseases. d) Length of stay: The length of stay can be obtained mechanically from the EHR system and the maximum value was set to 1,000 days. We set |M | for vanilla, hospital, physician, disease, and length of stay to 1, 5, 485, 2,600, and 1,000, respectively .
The vanilla embedding is prepared for the baseline in our experiment and to equalize the total number of parameters with the other models. The input to our model is the sum of E T , E P and E M . We also prepare an extra model with all features for our experiments. This takes all four feature embeddings (hospital, physician, disease, and length of stay) added to the encoder.

Datasets and Metrics

We evaluated our proposed method on a subset of data from National Hospital Organization (NHO), the largest multiinstitutional organization in Japan. The statistics of our data are shown in Table  , which includes 24,630 cases collected from five hospitals. Each case includes a discharge summary and progress notes for the days of stay.
The data are randomly split into 22,630, 1,000, and 1,000 for train, validation, and test, respectively. Summarization performances are reported in ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L and BERTScore in terms of F1. In addition, we also employed BLEURT , which models human judgment.

Architectures and Hyperparameters

Due to our hardware constraints we need a model that is computationally efficient, so we employed the Longformer instead of the conventional transformer. Longformer can  . In our model, number of layers, window size, dilation, input sequence length, output sequence length, batch size, learning rate and number of warmup steps are 8, 256, 1, 1024, 256, 4, 3e-5 and 1K, respectively.
Other hyperparameters are the same as in the original Longformer, except for the maximum number of epochs is not fixed and the best epoch. It is selected for each training using the validation data based on ROUGE-1. Also, the original Longformer imports pretrained-BART parameters to initial values, but we do not use pre-trained Japanese BART in this study.
We used three GeForce RTX 2080 TI for our experiments. Our vocabulary for preparing input to Longformer is taken from UTH-BERT , which is pre-trained on the Japanese clinical records. Since the vocabulary of UTH-BERT is trained by WordPiece , we also tokenize our data with WordPiece. However, the vocabulary does not include white space and line breaks, which cannot be handled, so we add those two tokens to the vocabulary, resulting in a total size of 25,002.
The vocabulary has all tokens in full characters, so we normalized full-wdith characters by converting all alphanumeric and symbolic characters to half-width for byte fallback. , we found that all the models with encoded medical meta-information perform better in ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L and BLEURT than the vanilla Longformer.
However, in BERTScore, only hospital and disease models outperform the vanilla. Specifically, disease information is most effective, improving ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore and BLEURT by 4.45, 0.73, 3.12, 3.77 and 0.21 points over the vanilla model, respectively. This seems to be because disease information and the ICD-10 ontology efficiently cluster groups with similar representations.
In contrast, in ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L, the model with physician embedding is inferior to the vanilla model. This seems to be a negative effect of grouping physicians without any consideration of their relevance. It would be better to cluster them by department, physician attributes, similarity of progress notes, etc. Regarding low ROUGE-2 scores in all models, a previous study using the English data set also reported a low ROUGE-2 score of about 5%, which may indicate an inherent difficulty in discharge summary generation.
In BERTScore, the models with the physician and the length of stay did not reach the performance of the vanilla model, suggesting that the system's outputs are semantically inferior. The model with all features performed the lowest of all models in BERTScore. The reason for the low score of the model with all features seems to be that its number of parameters in feature embedding was four times larger than that of the model with the individual feature, and the amount of training data was insufficient.
In BLEURT, all models with meta-information outperform vanilla, which suggests that they are more natural to humans. To analyze the influence of encoded meta-information on the outputs, we evaluate the precisions of the generated text. Specifically, we measure the probability that the generated words are included in the gold summary to investigate if the proper words are generated.
Some previous studies on faithfulness, which also analyze the output of summarization, have employed words or entities - . In this study, we focused on words, not entities, because we wanted to visualize expressions that are not only nouns. The words were segmented by MeCab with the J-MeDic. For each segmented word, the numeral and symbol labels were assigned as parts of speech by MeCab, the morphological analyzer, while the disease and symptom were assigned by the J-Medic dictionary.
The results, shown in Figure , indicate that the encoded disease information leads to generate more proper disease and symptom words. This indicates that the meta-information successfully learns disease-related expressions. The encoded hospital or physician information also improved the precision of symbols generation.
This suggests that different hospitals and physicians have different description habits (e.g., bullet points such as ""•"", ""*"" and ""-"", punctuation such as ""。"" and ""."", etc.), which can be grouped by meta-information. In this paper, we conducted a discharge summary generation experiment by adding four types of information to Longformer and verified the impact of the meta-information.
The results showed that all four types of information exceeded the performance of the vanilla Longformer model, with the highest performance achieved by encoding disease information. We found that meta-information is useful for abstractive summarization on discharge summaries. Our limitations are that we used Japanese EHR, the limited number of tested features and not performing human evaluations.
As for the efficacy of the meta-information, we believe that our results are applicable to non-Japanese, but it is left as Fig. . The precisions of words in the generated summaries. The vertical axis shows the probability that the words exist in the gold summary. a future work. Other meta-information may be worth verifying such as the patient's gender, age, race, religion and used EHR system, etc.
It is hard to collect a large amount of medical information and process it into meta-information, so we may need to develop a robust and flexible research infrastructure to conduct a more large scale cross-sectional study in the future. In the discharge summary generation task, which demands a high level of expertise, the human evaluation requires a lot of physicians' efforts and it is a very high cost which is unrealistic.
This is a general issue in tasks dealing with medical documents, and this study also could not perform human evaluations. On this research, informed consent and patient privacy are ensured in the following manner. Notices about their policy and the EHR data usage are posted at the hospitals. The patients who disagree with the policies can request opt-out and are excluded from the archive.
In case of minors and their parents, followed the same manner. In the case of minors and their parents are same. To conduct a research on the archive, researchers must submit their research proposals to the institutional review board. After the proposal is approved, the data is anonymized to build a dataset for analysis.
The data is accessible only in a secured room at the NHO headquarters, and only statistics are brought out of the secured room, for protection of patients' privacy. In the present research, the analysis was conducted under the IRB approval (IRB Approval No.: Wako3 2019-22) of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Japan, which has a collaboration agreement with the National Hospital Organization.
This data is not publicly available due to privacy restrictions. shows the detailed number of cases handled by physicians. In all hospitals, there is a large difference between the median and the maximum of cases/physician. This indicates that a few physicians handle a large number of cases and many physicians handle fewer cases.
It is impossible to avoid physician IDs first seen at test time without some process that averages the number of cases a physician holds.","[""Verifying other meta-information such as patient's gender, age, race, etc.""]",2947,multifieldqa_en,en,,6caa98612cf0e2ddf58e1ba70daaf79a3ac616280fb48188," A new feature embedding layer encoding hospital, physician, disease, and length of stay is added to the standard transformer architecture.

What types of data did the authors use in their experiments?,"\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Probabilistic models have proven to be very useful in a lot of applications in signal processing where signal estimation is needed \cite{rabiner1989tutorial,arulampalam2002tutorial,ji2008bayesian}. Some of their advantages are that 1) they force the designer to specify all the assumptions of the model, 2) they provide a clear separation between the model and the algorithm used to solve it, and 3) they usually provide some measure of uncertainty about the estimation.

On the other hand, adaptive filtering is a standard approach in estimation problems when the input is received as a stream of data that is potentially non-stationary. This approach is widely understood and applied to several problems such as echo cancellation \cite{gilloire1992adaptive}, noise cancellation \cite{nelson1991active}, and channel equalization \cite{falconer2002frequency}.

Although these two approaches share some underlying relations, there are very few connections in the literature. The first important attempt in the signal processing community to relate these two fields was the connection between a linear Gaussian state-space model (i.e. Kalman filter) and the RLS filter, by Sayed and Kailath \cite{sayed1994state} and then by Haykin \emph{et al.} \cite{haykin1997adaptive}. The RLS adaptive filtering algorithm emerges naturally when one defines a particular state-space model (SSM) and then performs exact inference in that model. This approach was later exploited in \cite{van2012kernel} to design a kernel RLS algorithm based on Gaussian processes.

A first attempt to approximate the LMS filter from a probabilistic perspective was presented in \cite{park2014probabilistic}, focusing on a kernel-based implementation. The algorithm of \cite{park2014probabilistic} makes use of a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate as an approximation for the predictive step. However, this approximation does not preserve the estimate of the uncertainty in each step, therefore degrading the performance of the algorithm.

In this work, we provide a similar connection between state-space models and least-mean-squares (LMS). Our approach is based on approximating the posterior distribution with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. We show how the computation of this approximated posterior leads to a linear-complexity algorithm, comparable to the standard LMS. Similar approaches have already been developed for a variety of problems such as channel equalization using recurrent RBF neural networks \cite{cid1994recurrent}, or Bayesian forecasting \cite{harrison1999bayesian}. Here, we show the usefulness of this probabilistic approach for adaptive filtering.

The probabilistic perspective we adopt throughout this work presents two main advantages. Firstly, a novel LMS algorithm with adaptable step size emerges naturally with this approach, making it suitable for both stationary and non-stationary environments. The proposed algorithm has less free parameters than previous LMS algorithms with variable step size \cite{kwong1992variable,aboulnasr1997robust,shin2004variable}, and its parameters are easier to be tuned w.r.t. these algorithms and standard LMS. Secondly, the use of a probabilistic model provides us with an estimate of the error variance, which is useful in many applications.

Experiments with simulated and real data show the advantages of the presented approach with respect to previous works. However, we remark that the main contribution of this paper is that it opens the door to introduce more Bayesian machine learning techniques, such as variational inference and Monte Carlo sampling methods \cite{barber2012bayesian}, to adaptive filtering.\\


\section{Probabilistic Model}

Throughout this work, we assume the observation model to be linear-Gaussian with the following distribution,

\begin{equation}
p(y_k|{\bf w}_k) = \mathcal{N}(y_k;{\bf x}_k^T {\bf w}_k , \sigma_n^2),
\label{eq:mess_eq}
\end{equation}
where  $\sigma_n^2$ is the variance of the observation noise, ${\bf x}_k$ is the regression vector and ${\bf w}_k$ is the parameter vector to be sequentially estimated, both $M$-dimensional column vectors.


In a non-stationary scenario, ${\bf w}_k$ follows a dynamic process. In particular, we consider a diffusion process (random-walk model) with variance $\sigma_d^2$ for this parameter vector:


\begin{equation}
p({\bf w}_k|{\bf w}_{k-1})= \mathcal{N}({\bf w}_k;{\bf w}_{k-1}, \sigma_d^2 {\bf I}),
\label{eq:trans_eq}
\end{equation}
where $\bf I$ denotes the identity matrix. In order to initiate the recursion, we assume the following prior distribution on ${\bf w}_k$

\begin{equation}
p({\bf w}_0)= \mathcal{N}({\bf w}_0;0, \sigma_d^2{\bf I}).\nonumber
\end{equation}

\section{Exact inference in this model: Revisiting the RLS filter}

Given the described probabilistic SSM, we would like to infer the posterior probability distribution $p({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k})$.
Since all involved distributions are Gaussian, one can perform exact inference, leveraging the probability rules in a straightforward manner. The resulting probability distribution is
\begin{equation}
p({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k}) =  \mathcal{N}({\bf w}_k;{\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k}, \boldsymbol\Sigma_{k}), \nonumber
\end{equation}
in which the mean vector ${\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
{\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_k = {\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k-1} + {\bf K}_k (y_k - {\bf x}_k^T {\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k-1}){\bf x}_k, \nonumber
\end{equation}
where we have introduced the auxiliary variable
\begin{equation}
{\bf K}_k = \frac{ \left(\boldsymbol\Sigma_{k-1} + \sigma_d^2 {\bf I}\right)}{{\bf x}_k^T  \left(\boldsymbol\Sigma_{k-1} + \sigma_d^2 {\bf I}\right)  {\bf x}_k + \sigma_n^2}, \nonumber
\end{equation}
and the covariance matrix $\boldsymbol\Sigma_k$ is obtained as
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol\Sigma_k = \left( {\bf I} -  {\bf K}_k{\bf x}_k {\bf x}_k^T \right) ( \boldsymbol\Sigma_{k-1} +\sigma_d^2), \nonumber
\end{equation}
Note that the mode of $p({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k})$, i.e. the maximum-a-posteriori estimate (MAP), coincides with the RLS adaptive rule
\begin{equation}
{{\bf w}}_k^{(RLS)} = {{\bf w}}_{k-1}^{(RLS)} + {\bf K}_k (y_k - {\bf x}_k^T {{\bf w}}_{k-1}^{(RLS)}){\bf x}_k .
\label{eq:prob_rls}
\end{equation}
This rule is similar to the one introduced in \cite{haykin1997adaptive}.

Finally, note that the covariance matrix $\boldsymbol\Sigma_k$ is a measure of the uncertainty of the estimate ${\bf w}_k$ conditioned on the observed data $y_{1:k}$. Nevertheless, for many applications a single scalar summarizing the variance of the estimate could prove to be sufficiently useful. In the next section, we show how such a scalar is obtained naturally when $p({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k})$ is approximated with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. We also show that this approximation leads to an LMS-like estimation.
 


\section{Approximating the posterior distribution: LMS filter }

The proposed approach consists in approximating the posterior distribution $p({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k})$, in general a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a full covariance matrix, by an isotropic spherical Gaussian distribution 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:aprox_post}
\hat{p}({\bf w}_{k}|y_{1:k})=\mathcal{N}({\bf w}_{k};{\bf \hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k}, \hat{\sigma}_{k}^2 {\bf I} ).
\end{equation}

In order to estimate the mean and covariance of the approximate distribution $\hat{p}({\bf w}_{k}|y_{1:k})$, we propose to select those that minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to the original distribution, i.e., 

\begin{equation}
\{\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}_k,\hat{\sigma}_k\}=\arg \displaystyle{  \min_{\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}_k,\hat{\sigma}_k}} \{ D_{KL}\left(p({\bf w}_{k}|y_{1:k}))\| \hat{p}({\bf w}_{k}|y_{1:k})\right) \}. \nonumber
\end{equation}

The derivation of the corresponding minimization problem can be found in Appendix A. In particular, the optimal mean and the covariance are found as
\begin{equation}
{\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k} = {\boldsymbol\mu}_{k};~~~~~~ \hat{\sigma}_{k}^2 = \frac{{\sf Tr}\{ \boldsymbol\Sigma_k\} }{M}.
\label{eq:sigma_hat}
\end{equation}


We now show that by using \eqref{eq:aprox_post} in the recursive predictive and filtering expressions we obtain an LMS-like adaptive rule. First, let us assume that we have an approximate posterior distribution at $k-1$, $\hat{p}({\bf w}_{k-1}|y_{1:k-1}) =  \mathcal{N}({\bf w}_{k-1};\hat{\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k-1}, \hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2 {\bf I} )$. Since all involved distributions are Gaussian, the predictive distribution
is obtained as %
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{p}({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k-1}) &=& \int p({\bf w}_k|{\bf w}_{k-1}) \hat{p}({\bf w}_{k-1}|y_{1:k-1}) d{\bf w}_{k-1} \nonumber\\
&=& \mathcal{N}({\bf w}_k;{\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k|k-1}, \boldsymbol\Sigma_{k|k-1}), 
\label{eq:approx_pred}
\end{eqnarray}
where the mean vector and covariance matrix are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k|k-1} &=& \hat{\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k-1} \nonumber \\
\hat{\boldsymbol\Sigma}_{k|k-1} &=& (\hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2 + \sigma_d^2 ){\bf I}\nonumber.
\end{eqnarray}

From \eqref{eq:approx_pred}, the posterior distribution at time $k$ can be computed using Bayes' Theorem and standard Gaussian manipulations (see for instance \cite[Ch. 4]{murphy2012machine}). Then, we approximate the posterior $p({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k})$ with an isotropic Gaussian,
\begin{equation}
\hat{p}({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k}) =  \mathcal{N}({\bf w}_k ; {\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k}, \hat{\sigma}_k^2 {\bf I} ),\nonumber
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{eqnarray}
{\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k} &= & {\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k-1}+ \frac{ (\hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2+ \sigma_d^2)  }{(\hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2+ \sigma_d^2)  \|{\bf x}_k\|^2 + \sigma_n^2} (y_k - {\bf x}_k^T {\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k-1}){\bf x}_k  \nonumber  \\
&=& {\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k-1}+ \eta_k (y_k - {\bf x}_k^T {\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k-1}){\bf x}_k . 
\label{eq:prob_lms}
\end{eqnarray}
Note that, instead of a gain matrix ${\bf K}_k$ as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:prob_rls}, we now have a scalar gain $\eta_k$ that operates as a variable step size.


Finally, to obtain the posterior variance, which is our measure of uncertainty, we apply \eqref{eq:sigma_hat} and the trick ${\sf Tr}\{{\bf x}_k{\bf x}_k^T\}= {\bf x}_k^T{\bf x}_k= \|{\bf x}_k \|^2$,

\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\sigma}_k^2 &=& \frac{{\sf Tr}(\boldsymbol\Sigma_k)}{M} \\
&=& \frac{1}{M}{\sf Tr}\left\{ \left( {\bf I} -  \eta_k {\bf x}_k {\bf x}_k^T \right) (\hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2 +\sigma_d^2)\right\} \\
&=& \left(1 - \frac{\eta_k \|{\bf x}_k\|^2}{M}\right)(\hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2 +\sigma_d^2).
\label{eq:sig_k}
\end{eqnarray}
If MAP estimation is performed, we obtain  an adaptable step-size LMS estimation

\begin{equation}
{\bf w}_{k}^{(LMS)} = {\bf w}_{k-1}^{(LMS)} + \eta_k (y_k - {\bf x}_k^T {\bf w}_{k-1}^{(LMS)}){\bf x}_k, 	
\label{eq:lms}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\eta_k = \frac{ (\hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2+ \sigma_d^2)  }{(\hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2+ \sigma_d^2)  \|{\bf x}_k\|^2 + \sigma_n^2}.\nonumber
\end{equation}
At this point, several interesting remarks can be made:

\begin{itemize}

\item The adaptive rule \eqref{eq:lms} has linear complexity since it does not require us to compute the full matrix $\boldsymbol\Sigma_k$.

\item For a stationary model, we have $\sigma_d^2=0$ in \eqref{eq:prob_lms} and \eqref{eq:sig_k}. In this case, the algorithm remains valid and both the step size and the error variance, $\hat{\sigma}_{k}$, vanish over time $k$. 

\item Finally, the proposed adaptable step-size LMS has only two parameters, $\sigma_d^2$ and $\sigma_n^2$, (and only one, $\sigma_n^2$, in stationary scenarios) in contrast to other variable step-size algorithms \cite{kwong1992variable,aboulnasr1997robust,shin2004variable}. More interestingly, both $\sigma_d^2$ and $\sigma_n^2$ have a clear underlying physical meaning, and they can be estimated in many cases. We will comment more about this in the next section. 
\end{itemize}



\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in both stationary and tracking experiments. In the first experiment, we estimate a fixed vector ${\bf w}^{o}$ of dimension $M=50$. The entries of the vector are independently and uniformly chosen in the range $[-1,1]$. Then, the vector is normalized so that $\|{\bf w}^o\|=1$. Regressors $\boldsymbol{x}_{k}$ are zero-mean Gaussian vectors with identity covariance matrix. The additive noise variance is such that the SNR is $20$ dB. We compare our algorithm with standard RLS and three other LMS-based algorithms: LMS, NLMS \cite{sayed2008adaptive}, VSS-LMS \cite{shin2004variable}.\footnote{The used parameters for each algorithm are: for RLS $\lambda=1$, $\epsilon^{-1}=0.01$; for LMS $\mu=0.01$; for NLMS $\mu=0.5$; and for VSS-LMS $\mu_{max}=1$, $\alpha=0.95$, $C=1e-4$.} The probabilistic LMS algorithm in \cite{park2014probabilistic} is not simulated because it is not suitable for stationary environments.

In stationary environments, the proposed algorithm has only one parameter, $\sigma^2_n$. We simulate both the scenario where we have perfectly knowledge of the amount of noise (probLMS1) and the case where the value $\sigma^2_n$ is $100$ times smaller than the actual value (probLMS2). The Mean-Square Deviation (${\sf MSD} = {\mathbb E} \| {\bf w}_0 - {\bf w}_k \|^2$), averaged out over $50$ independent simulations, is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:msd_statationary}.

\caption{Performance in terms of MSD of probabilistic LMS with both optimal (probLMS1) and suboptimal (probLMS2) compared to LMS, NLMS, VS-LMS, and RLS.}
\label{fig:msd_statationary}
\end{figure}

The performance of probabilistic LMS is close to RLS (obviously at a much lower computational cost) and largely outperforms previous variable step-size LMS algorithms proposed in the literature. Note that, when the model is stationary, i.e. $\sigma^2_d=0$ in \eqref{eq:trans_eq},  both the uncertainty $\hat{\sigma}^2_k$, and the adaptive step size $\eta_k$, vanish over time. This implies that the error tends to zero when $k$ goes to infinity. Fig. \ref{fig:msd_statationary} also shows that the proposed approach is not very sensitive to a bad choice of its only parameter, as demonstrated by the good results of probLMS2, which uses a $\sigma^2_n$ that is $100$ times smaller than the optimal value.

\newpage
In a second experiment, we test the tracking capabilities of the proposed algorithm with {real} data of a wireless MISO channel acquired in a realistic indoor scenario. More details on the setup can be found in \cite{gutierrez2011frequency}. Fig. \ref{fig_2} shows the real part of one of the channels, and the estimate of the proposed algorithm. The shaded area represents the estimated uncertainty for each prediction, i.e. $\hat{\mu}_k\pm2\hat{\sigma}_k$. Since the experimental setup does not allow us to obtain the optimal values for the parameters, we fix these parameters to their values that optimize the steady-state mean square deviation (MSD). \hbox{Table \ref{tab:table_MSD}} shows this steady-state MSD of the estimate of the MISO channel with different methods. As can be seen, the best tracking performance is obtained by standard LMS and the proposed method. 





\section{Conclusions and Opened Extensions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

{We have presented a probabilistic interpretation of the least-mean-square filter. The resulting algorithm is an adaptable step-size LMS that performs well both in stationary and tracking scenarios. Moreover, it has fewer free parameters than previous approaches and these parameters have a clear physical meaning. Finally, as stated in the introduction, one of the advantages of having a probabilistic model is that it is easily extensible:}

\begin{itemize}
\item If, instead of using an isotropic Gaussian distribution in the approximation, we used a Gaussian with diagonal covariance matrix, we would obtain a similar algorithm with different step sizes and measures of uncertainty, for each component of ${\bf w}_k$. Although this model can be more descriptive, it needs more parameters to be tuned, and the parallelism with LMS vanishes.
\item Similarly, if we substitute the transition model of \eqref{eq:trans_eq} by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, 

\begin{equation}
p({\bf w}_k|{\bf w}_{k-1})= \mathcal{N}({\bf w}_k;\lambda {\bf w}_{k-1}, \sigma_d^2), \nonumber
\label{eq:trans_eq_lambda}
\end{equation}
a similar algorithm is obtained but with a forgetting factor $\lambda$ multiplying ${\bf w}_{k-1}^{(LMS)}$ in \eqref{eq:lms}. This algorithm may have improved performance under such a kind of autoregresive dynamics of ${\bf w}_{k}$, though, again, the connection with standard LMS becomes dimmer.

\item As in \cite{park2014probabilistic}, the measurement model \eqref{eq:mess_eq} can be changed to obtain similar adaptive algorithms for classification, ordinal regression, and Dirichlet regression for compositional data. 

\item A similar approximation technique could be applied to more complex dynamical models, i.e. switching dynamical models \cite{barber2010graphical}. The derivation of efficient adaptive algorithms that explicitly take into account a switch in the dynamics of the parameters of interest is a non-trivial and open problem, though the proposed approach could be useful.

\item Finally, like standard LMS, this algorithm can be kernelized for its application in estimation under non-linear scenarios.

\end{itemize}

\section{KL divergence between a general gaussian distribution and an isotropic gaussian}
\label{sec:kl}

 We want to approximate  $p_{{\bf x}_1}(x) = \mathcal{N}({\bf x}; \boldsymbol\mu_1,\boldsymbol\Sigma_1)$ by $p_{{\bf x}_2}({\bf x}) = \mathcal{N}({\bf x}; \boldsymbol\mu_2,\sigma_2^2 {\bf I})$. In order to do so, we have to compute the parameters of $p_{{\bf x}_2}({\bf x})$, $\boldsymbol\mu_2$ and $\sigma_2^2$, that minimize the following Kullback-Leibler divergence,

\begin{eqnarray}
D_{KL}(p_{{\bf x}_1}\| p_{{\bf x}_2}) &=&\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p_{{\bf x}_1}({\bf x}) \ln{\frac{p_{{\bf x}_1}({\bf x})}{p_{{\bf x}_2}({\bf x})}}d{\bf x} \nonumber  \\
&= &  \frac{1}{2} \{ -M + {\sf Tr}(\sigma_2^{-2} {\bf I}\cdot \boldsymbol\Sigma_1^{-1})  \nonumber \\
  & &  + (\boldsymbol\mu_2 - \boldsymbol\mu_1 )^T \sigma^{-2}_2{\bf I} (\boldsymbol\mu_2 - \boldsymbol\mu_1 )  \nonumber \\
 & &   +  \ln \frac{{\sigma_2^2}^M}{\det\boldsymbol\Sigma_1} \}.  
\label{eq:divergence}
\end{eqnarray}
Using symmetry arguments, we obtain 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol\mu_2^{*} =\arg \displaystyle{  \min_{\boldsymbol\mu_2}} \{ D_{KL}(p_{{\bf x}_1}\| p_{{\bf x}_2}) \} = \boldsymbol\mu_1.
\end{equation}
Then, \eqref{eq:divergence} gets simplified into 

\begin{eqnarray}
D_{KL}(p_{{\bf x}_1}\| p_{{\bf x}_2}) = \frac{1}{2}\lbrace { -M + {\sf Tr}(\frac{\boldsymbol\Sigma_1}{\sigma_2^{2}}) + \ln \frac{\sigma_2^{2M}}{\det\boldsymbol\Sigma_1}}\rbrace.
\end{eqnarray}
The variance $\sigma_2^2$ is computed in order to minimize this Kullback-Leibler divergence as

\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_2^{2*} &=& \arg\min_{\sigma_2^2} D_{KL}(P_{x_1}\| P_{x_2}) \nonumber \\
 &=& \arg\min_{\sigma_2^2}\{ \sigma_2^{-2}{\sf Tr}\{\boldsymbol\Sigma_1\} + M\ln \sigma_2^{2} \} .
\end{eqnarray}
Deriving and making it equal zero leads to

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma_2^2} \left[ \frac{{\sf Tr}\{\boldsymbol\Sigma_1\}}{\sigma_2^{2}} + M \ln \sigma_2^{2} \right] = \left. {\frac{M}{\sigma_2^{2}}-\frac{{\sf Tr}\{\boldsymbol\Sigma_1\}}{(\sigma_2^{2})^2}}\right|_{\sigma_2^{2}=\sigma_2^{2*}}\left. =0 \right. .
\nonumber
\end{equation}
Finally, since the divergence has a single extremum in $R_+$,
\begin{equation}
\sigma_2^{2*} = \frac{{\sf Tr}\{\boldsymbol\Sigma_1\}}{M}.
\end{equation}

We provide a similar connection between state-space models and least-mean-squares (LMS) Our approach is based on approximating the posterior distribution with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. We show how the computation of this approximated posterior leads to a linear-complexity algorithm, comparable to the standard LMS. The main contribution of this paper is that it opens the door to introduce more Bayesian machine learning techniques, such as variational inference and Monte Carlo sampling methods, to adaptive filtering. The proposed algorithm has less free parameters than previous LMS algorithms with variable step size and its parameters are easier to be tuned w.r.t. these algorithms and standard L MS. The use of a probabilistic model provides us with an estimate of the error variance, which is useful in many applications. We assume the observation model to be linear-Gaussian with the following distribution. In a non-stationary scenario, ${\bf w}_k$ follows a dynamic process. In order to initiate the recursion, we assume the following prior distribution. The resulting probability distribution is the maximum-a-posteriori estimate (MAP), which coincides with the RLS adaptive rule. In the next section, we show how such a scalar is obtained when such a data set is conditioned on the observed data $y_k. Nevertheless, many applications could prove to be useful to prove the estimate could be sufficiently useful to be sufficiently powerful to be of interest to a large number of people. For example, we could use it to prove that a single scalar for a single set of data could be useful for a large group of people to work with. We will also use the model to show that such scalar could be used to prove many other applications, such as in the case of a large data set with a large sample size and a large distribution of observed data. We conclude that the model can be used as a basis for a number of different types of machine-learning algorithms, for example, to predict the outcome of a test on a set of real-world data. For the purposes of this article, we will use the Bayes' Bayes test. We now show that by using the recursive predictive and filtering expressions we obtain an LMS-like adaptive rule. First, let us assume that we have an approximate posterior distribution at $k-1. Then, we approximate the posterior $p({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k})$ with an isotropic Gaussian. Finally, we apply the scalar gain, which operates as a variable step size, to obtain the measure of uncertainty, which is our measure of the posterior variance. The result is a Gaussian distribution with a gain of a gain matrix of size 1/3 of the mean vector and a covariance matrix of 2/3 the square root of the value of the gain matrix. The posterior distribution can be computed using Bayes' Theorem and standard Gaussian manipulations (see for instance \cite[Ch. 4]{murphy2012machine} for more details. For more details on the Bayes Theorem, see http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/29/science/features/bayes-theorem-predictive-prediction.html#storylink=cpy. To see the rest of the article, please visit: http://science-news.co.uk/2013-01/30/science-science-features/predicting-predicted-predictions.html. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in both stationary and tracking experiments. We compare our algorithm with standard RLS and three other LMS-based algorithms: LMS, NLMS, VS-LMS, and RLS. The performance of probabilistic LMS is close to RLS (obviously at a much lower computational cost) and largely outperforms previous variable step-size LMS algorithms proposed in the literature. We simulate both the scenario where we have perfectly knowledge of the amount of noise (probLMS1) and the case where the value $\sigma^2_n$ is $100$ times smaller than the actual value. The Mean-Square Deviation (MSD) averaged out over $50$ independent simulations is presented in Fig. 1. The algorithm is not simulated because it is not suitable for stationary environments. It also shows that the proposed approach is not very sensitive to a bad choice of its only parameter, as demonstrated by the good results of probLMS2, which uses a $100 $ smaller value than the optimal value. We conclude that when the model is stationary, i.e. both the uncertainty and adaptive step size vanish over time. This implies that the error tends to zero when $k$ goes to infinity. We have presented a probabilistic interpretation of the least-mean-square filter. Since the experimental setup does not allow us to obtain the optimal values for the parameters, we fix these parameters to their values that optimize the steady-state mean square deviation. The resulting algorithm is an adaptable step-size LMS that performs well both in stationary and tracking scenarios.

We want to approximate  $p 1 (x) = \mathcal{N}({\bf x}; \boldsymbol\mu_2,  ‘sigma_2’, ‘’sigma’ I’;. ‘p’ (x), “p” (x) (‘x’), ’’‘”’(x),’. ’.”.’,.’., ‘;’ ‘.‘,’.’: ‘, ’,”,. ’;”, ”. ”,.”., ’,. ‘:’!’].’ The variance $sigma_2^2$ is computed in order to minimize this Kullback-Leibler divergence as $R_+$. Since the divergence has a single extremum in $R +$, making it equal zero leads to the equation: $Sigma 2 2* = M R R_R_1 + M}. The formula is: $RRR_2* = M R R_R 1 + M S S_S_1+M S-S R-S."
What is the purpose of the baseline in the layout procedure?,"Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go ""perfectly."" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane.
This is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes.
While building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying ""banana"" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built.
First understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the ""projected"" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are ""foreshortened"" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to ""develop"" the ""true"" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat.
Second, understand that the dimensions called for in the plans put a twist in the sides that tends to work the panel in two directions of curvature. This twist makes the panel ""undevelopable"" meaning that that shape cannot be unrolled into an equivalent flat shape. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. To illustrate this, try forming a piece of paper around a soda can. The paper can be formed flat around the can either straight or at a diagonal to it's length. It has only one direction of curvature and is by definition ""developable"". Now try to form the same piece of paper around a baseball. It won't lie flat on the surface without some deformation (folding, wrinkling or tearing) of the paper. The ball has curvature in more that one direction and is a ""compounded"" shape. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain.
Initially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home), the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical shape firewall to tailstock.
This method borrows heavily from proven techniques used in the marine trades. It should be stressed at this point that although the layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time. If the layout is not going well initially, start over! Better to erase layout errors now than to have them built it and cause surprises later.
Layout to ensure a fair and true fuselage starts by drawing a reference line (baseline) on the building surface. Refer to figures 2 & 3 and use a wire guide to draw a very straight baseline. About 500 lbs. Of tension should be adequate. One could use a chalk line, but we're talking airplanes here, not house framing.
The main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Although the baseline will still be the reference, the top and bottom longerons will be laid separately.
Layout differences don't end there. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. Another major difference is that the bottom & side panels are applied after forming the fuselage box section. This is mainly to obtain the ability to ""fair"" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape.
Refer to figure 1 for the layout of the new developed side panel. The firewall (station a) is layed out perpendicular to the baseline. Longitudinal (station) measurements are given along the length of the baseline from the firewall. Vertical dimensions are given to reference the angle and breadths of the station at the baseline.
Notice that the top longeron is bowed outward and that the stations are spaced slightly greater than called out in the plans. When the panels are formed into the box frame section ,they will work into the dimensions specified in the plans.
Strike a centerline, longer than is needed on the building surface using a wire guide. Draw off the firewall line perpendicular to the centerline at one end.
Using the distances listed in the balloons, mark them off on the centerline. Distances are measured to the nearest sixteenth of an inch. Take time to mark them off carefully. Don't mark off the distances in a cumulative fashion. Use the firewall as a common reference.
Using the angles listed at each station, mark off a station line longer than is needed. The angles are measured to the nearest hundredth of a degree. Take time to mark them off carefully.
At each station, start by marking off each short (bottom longeron) line distance from the centerline. Use your set of trammels or beam compass for doing this. Mark the intersection of the short line with the station line.
At each station, mark off each long (top longeron) line distance from the intersection of the short line distance and the station line. Again the trammels or beam compass is best for completing this step. Mark the intersection of the long line distance with the station line.
Using the longeron as a batten, trace out the inside and outside curves of the longeron. After the batten is secure, in between each station, fasten a keeper block inside and outside to preserve the shape of the longeron taking care to avoid potential future interference with the diagonal members to be installed later. The fairing blocks can be removed or left in place if they won't interfere with building. The vertical station members and their diagonals can now be measured and positioned. Remember to refer to the plans for the material thickness direction.
After vertical and diagonal members are cut and fitted, take time to draw their outlines on the building surface to cut down on time and confusion when laying out the opposite side.
Finishing the side panel is accomplished in a manner similar to that called for in the handbook with the exception that the side and bottom skin panels will be attached later.
The next article in the series will discuss jigging and building techniques to ensure alignment and straightness of the flat built side panels. Also covered will be building a ""strongback"" jig to assure alignment of the side panels when they are formed into their final shape.
Part 3 in the series will cover assembly of the side panels using the jigs. Some joint details will be discussed that will ensure a stronger and more fair fuselage assembly. Also covered will be the layout & attachment of the side and bottom ply skins.

""Scarfing"" is the practice of splicing plywood so that short pieces of plywood can be used to span long distances. On the KR, it is required on both the fuselage skins and spar webs. The angle of the splice should be 10 to 12 degrees to maintain strength across the joint. Also, joints should coincide with structural members, such as spar webs or fuselage truss members.
This scarfer is made by mating a regular plunge router (this one costs about $50) to a table saw. Obviously, you really only need a table saw to cut the chamfer, but it does make a nice heavy table for scarfing. You could just as easily use a large work table as the base.First, set the table saw for a 5.5 degree cut (for a 1:12 joint, or 6.5 degree cut for a 10:1 joint), and run a 1 x 6 through on edge to chamfer a corner on the board. Then drill the board for three router mounting holes (two are countersunk) and connect the assembly to the table saw with two 1/4 inch bolts. Use a long (2-3 inch) straight cutting bit to do the cutting. Adjust the bit so it doesn't interfere with your table top, and go to town. Keep pressure on the plywood to ensure contact with the table while you're scarfing. Make sure you feed your material from the same end as you would if you were sawing, or the router will take your plywood away from you and put a big dent in your garage door.
In the late 60's Ken Rand and Stuart Robinson were working as flight system engineers for Douglas Avionics. Ken was working as an electrical engineer, having previously worked for Sperry as an autopilots project engineer, while Stu's degree was in aeronautical engineering from Northrop University. They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer.
They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport.
Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79.
To date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2"" between firewall and main spar, and 14"" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts.
Mike Stearns addresses the KR Forum crowd.
This year's KR Forum featured guest speakers Mike Stearns, Steve Trentman, and Bill Marcey. Mike Stearns spoke on several topics, including the many sources for KR and homebuilding information available on the Internet. He also mentioned KRNet, the list server devoted entirely to KR aircraft, as well as several notable World Wide Web home pages. He also brought a sample of the new Rand Robinson wing skins with him, and discussed their high temperature core prepreg construction. His KR2S will receive the first set, which is currently being installed at Hinson Composites.
Steve Trentman spoke on his turbine installation. It uses a turbine engine which saw duty as an A7 attack jet starter engine. Total weight is about 85 pounds, while putting out around 90 horsepower. There is a small stockpile of these engines available from government surplus. sources. This engine can only be throttled back to 52% power, which leads to some pretty interesting landings. One inflight failure has been logged so far, with very little damage to the aircraft. More on this exciting development in next month's issue of KROnline.
Les Palmer's KR2 N202LP won Best KR2, Best Engine Installation, and People's Choice awards at the 1995 KR Gathering at Columbia, TN. After researching the KR series, and reading Neil Bingham's ""A Critical Analysis of the KR2"" (Jan 88 Sport Aviation), Les decided to build his as a single seater, stretched 24"" in the tail, while maintaining a stock width firewall. His fuselage is made from Douglas fir, which weighs in at 4 lbs heavier than if constructed from spruce. It is skinned with 1/8"" birch plywood. Spars are covered with plywoood on both fore and aft sides, ala KR2S. Diehl wing skins provide the lift. Horizontal stabilizer and elevator were stretched 7"" longer on each side, while the vertical stabilizer and rudder were stretched 8"" taller. . The fuselage to cowling junction was made more graceful by adding 1.5 inches to the height of the firewall end of the fuselage sides.
Les's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. The canopy frame fits snugly into a recess in the foward deck, providing an excellent wind and water seal. The fiberglass work is exemplary.
Seating is luxurious for one.
The cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. Female molds were made for all the fiberglass parts on Les's plane, so he could proabably be persuaded to make more, if demand dictates. Les also machines a multitude of KR aluminum and steel parts which he now offers for sale.
The firewall was reinforced with aluminum brackets and angles bolted between the longerons in anticipation of the 200 lb Subaru EA-81 engine installation. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Other than tapping the crank for larger bolts to mount the redrive, no other engine modifications were required. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy.
Originally built as a taildragger, the fixed gear is made from 4130 steel tubing. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6"" Cleveland calipers for braking. An early taxi test accident damaged the main gear, and prompted Les to change to tricycle gear. Again, he designed his own fiberglass main gear, and uses a Diehl nose wheel fork with a 4130 strut and 6"" wheel up front.
Early tests revealed cooling problems, which prompted a radiator move from the firewall to a lower cowling location.
The first flight was almost a disaster, as test pilot Randy Smith lost power right after takeoff. He managed a 180 with a safe downwind landing with only minor nosewheel pant damage. The culprit proved to be a spark plug with too much reach, which was quickly remedied. Subsequent flights have shown water temp to be about 210 degrees, oil temp is 220-230, and airspeed is about 180 mph.
Shopping for the Partially Built KR.
This story starts about twenty years ago when I first started looking at the KR-2 as the plane I'd like to build. The only problem at that time was a lack of money, lack of knowledge, and a lack of job stability. I liked the design, except for the low ground clearance of the retractable gear and that a KR was going to be a tight fit for me to fly.
Over the past twenty years I've owned a number of planes, but still always wanted to build my own. I needed one that would fit me, my budget requirements, and have the speed and performance that I wanted. When ""KITPLANES"" published the article featuring Roy Marsh's new KR-2S, it was the first I had heard of any major modifications or improvements to the same old KR design. I believe that article and Roy Marsh's workmanship have probably been the greatest boon to Rand Robinson (RR) in the last twenty years. It certainly caught my eye! Here was the same design I had decided I wanted to build twenty years ago, with all of the improvements I wanted. It was sitting on fixed gear with some reasonable ground clearance. It had the capability to be built large enough to accommodate me. It has enough prefab parts available that it didn't have to be 100% scratch built if I decided to hurry the project along. And it had the speed I wanted. I knew that Roy's published speeds were probably not realistic expectations for the average KR, but after knocking around for the last three years in my Champ, anything over 90 mph seems pretty fast to me.
After purchasing the info kit and the sales video from Rand Robinson, the next step after deciding for sure to build this plane was to order the KR-2 plans and the KR-2S addendum. I finally got my plans and was putting together my first order to start the plane, when my partner in the Champ pointed out that there was a partially completed KR-2S for sale in Trade-a-plane. My initial answer was ""No, I don't even want to look at it. I want to build my own from scratch."" My partner insisted that for the advertised price and the fact that it wasn't too far away, I ought to at least give the guy a call and investigate it. ""No, I don't think I want to buy someone else's problems,"" I persisted. That night I went home and crunched up some numbers on the calculator and finally came to the conclusion that for the sake of my budget for the next several years, I really should give this guy a call.
Three days later, I flew to his place about 400 miles away to take a look at his project. At this point I should probably mention that I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable about airplane construction, although the vast majority of my experience is with tube and fabric. The rest of this article deals with what I looked for and more importantly what I missed and have had to repair in the last year since I purchased the project.
When we went to the seller's house, I found that the left wing was built using the Dan Diehl wing skins and the right wing skins were leaning against the wall inside the house. Also the canopy was in the house with the canopy covered with paper and tape. I wanted to inspect the fuselage first, so off we went to the shop.
There I found a fuselage sitting on it's gear painted in primer gray. The first step was to inspect the quality of workmanship of what could be seen as it sat. The interior of the fuselage looked as if it had been built with a great deal of care. The fit and finish of all of the interior wood was very nice. Even the gussets looked like they had been painstakingly perfectly fitted. The glass work on the turtle back also looked very precise and clean. It was evenly faired into the vertical and horizontal stabs. The tail also appeared to be well built with the exception of a depression directly over the front and rear spars in the horizontal stabs. He explained that when he moved recently, that he had shot the plane with gray primer to protect it from the weather since he wouldn't have ready access to a shop to put it in right away. It ended up sitting out in the hot south Texas summer sun for a few weeks before he got a shop rented to work in. That caused the glass (or possibly the foam inside the horizontal stab) to swell, except that it held onto the spar, so it was slightly ballooned in front of and behind the spars. His recommendation was to fill it back smooth with micro.
I also found a small linear crack in the lower left wing spar cap on the left wing stub. It appeared to be from over tightening the rear spar wing attach fitting bolts. His explanation was that the crack wasn't important because the rear spars only job is to keep the wings from folding back. I also noticed that the holes for attaching the outer wing to the wing stub were badly rounded out on the rear spar. He explained that the Diehl wing skins require the rear spar to be swept slightly more forward than the stock wings. This won't allow you to use the rear spar attach fittings from RR and that I would need to fabricate a new set of rear spar attach fittings.
I also found that the aileron bellcranks were not built or installed as per plans, but found that they looked professional. I couldn't check for function since the right bellcrank and sheeve wasn't installed, the left wing also wasn't installed, and the right wing didn't exist yet.
Next we pulled the inspection panels off of the fuselage and tail and looked at everything I could see with a good flashlight. I didn't find anything else that might be questionable about the fuselage except for a cracked elevator trim tab that was damaged when it fell off it's hanging place on the wall.
Next we spent some time going over his builders log and builders photo album. I still hadn't seen anything that would dissuade me from buying this project.
At this point it was starting to get late and my ride down needed to get airborne for the flight home. I needed to make a decision about whether I wanted this project or not, but I hadn't inspected the wings and canopy yet. I took a cursory look at the left wing and saw lots on micro built up on it and some bubbles in the leading edge, but nothing that looked seriously wrong to my amateur eye. The right wing was only a set of spars in the shop and the Diehl wing skins in the house, so there wasn't much to look at there. The canopy was wrapped in paper and tape, so there wasn't much to look at there either. I decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the project. For the advertised price, I could build a new set of wings and still be way ahead financially. We negotiated a final price, shook hands, took my ride to the airport, and started off in search of a U-haul to haul the project home.
Now, at this point, some of you are thinking about what I surely must have forgotten to inspect and why didn't I take a local A & P or EAA member along for the ride. First of all, I don't know any mechanics locally that have any experience with glass and our EAA chapter of which I am VP is woefully lacking in fiberglass knowledge. Secondly, as you will see, I missed plenty. Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough.
Now for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with.
I found that the lower set of rear spar attach fittings on the left rear spar were installed backwards with the longer spaced hole towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Also in the same area he had drilled through the rear spar with a hole saw to create a place for the aileron cable to pass through and managed to cut out the second from the outside vertical brace in the spar. Then he chose to install the aileron bellcranks in front of the rear spar, and cut another hole through the rear spar for the aileron push rod. He also managed to cut out the outside vertical brace in the spar. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in, cut the whole rear spar carrythrough out of the fuselage including ruining the left lower wing skin, or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap and install a custom built set of attach fittings.
I also found that after I built and installed the right side wing stub ribs and skin that the aileron bellcrank setup would not work as installed. The cable that crosses between the two bellcranks had a sharp uphill from the sheeve to the bellcrank in the last 12 inches on either side. This combined with the radius that the bellcranks turn caused the cross cable to pull up tight when the ailerons were pushed to either end of their travel, but allowed the cables to go very slack when the ailerons were centered. Also the Aileron pushrods needed to pass directly through the lower set of rear wing attach fittings to attach to the aileron. This whole rear spar and aileron bellcrank setup was going to either have to be redesigned or cut out and built to plans. The bottom line is that the problems I observed when I inspected this part were much more serious than expected when I had to fix it.
I decided that I had to remove the rear fittings from the left wing to be replaced with the new set that my neighborhood machinist was cutting out for me. When I put the wing on the work bench to start removing the rear fittings, I thought I had better take a closer look at the bubbles in the leading edge. I found that as I pushed on the leading edge, it delaminated between the glass lay-up on top and the upper and lower wing skin edges that were floxed together underneath. I concluded that that area had to come apart and took a belt sander to the leading edge. What I found was that the leading edge had been floxed together and glassed over, but the mold release had never been scrubbed off the leading edge of the wing. It peeled apart for rebuild quite easily.
When I got back to removing the rear spar attach fittings, I noticed that the woodwork inside the wing looked awfully dull. The reason was that the wing had been closed up without varnishing any of the woodwork. This was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer.
I also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. The tapered pipe threads were tapered the wrong way to install the draincock into the tank. Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem.
When I finally got around to attaching the wing to the fuselage, I found that the front spar attach fittings were badly misaligned. Although they could be forced into alignment, I didn't think I needed that kind of preload on the main spar fittings. This problem was fixed by calling on my local neighborhood machinist to build me an aligning fixture and reaming the attach holes to the next larger size and ordering the new sized bolts.
On the fuselage I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. I must complement the manufacturers for taking care of that problem. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels and brakes even though the receipt for this set was over four years old and in the original builders name. Their only concern was that this set had never been placed in service yet.
I chose to sand the load of micro off the left wing to see what it was covering. When I got down to the glass, I found that there was no glass for the aft inch and a half of the underside of the wing in front of the aileron hinge. With the Diehl wing skins, you build the wings, then cut the ailerons out of trailing edge of the wing. He had mismeasured and cut too much material off the bottom side of the trailing edge in front of the aileron. It was filled by floxing a piece of spruce into the gap to fill the space between the back edge of the fiberglass and the aileron mount. I chose to wrap the trailing edge of that wing, and the other wing to match with a couple of lay-ups of glass.
When I sanded the primer off the aforementioned damaged trim tab, I found that the hinge was floxed to the leading edge of the foam insides of the tab, but not the glass. I also chose to wrap the front of the trim tab with a lay-up of glass.
I decided to pull the paper off the canopy and take a look at it before I'm ready to bolt it on and fly. The original builder had blown his own canopy and after some of the previous problems, I was beginning to have some concerns about not having looked it over closely enough. The canopy turned out to have been blow a little too large. It ended up with a little larger bubble for headroom, which I didn't object to. However, it had more headroom on the right side than the left. Yes, it was just a little bit lopsided. The main problem was that the canopy is stretched thin enough that it can be easily pushed in with one hand when the weather is warm.. My fear was that this is just thin enough that it may decide to lay on my head or in my lap when flying on a warm day. It will have to be replaced.
I'm sure that many that are reading this could see several of the potential problems before I mentioned them, but some others may not have and I'm sure that there could have been many other problems that didn't but could have existed on this project. This is also not intended to be critical of the gentleman that started this project as many parts of it, especially the wood work are better than I could have done and much of his work is outstanding. I prefer to think that I'll end up with a better plane with his woodwork combined with my glasswork. This article is intended to feature some of the problems that you may run into in buying someone else's project.
The final question is, knowing what I have found over the past year, would I have still purchased this project. The answer is yes, but primarily because the price was right in that I am still money and work ahead of where I would be if I had started the project from scratch. There are a few things that I would have done differently, but nothing that I can't live with. Although I won't be able to say that I built it all from scratch, I have built and rebuild enough of the plane that I should have no problem qualifying under the 51% rule.

Here is an brief explanation of how I built my turtledecks. The jig was constructed from scrap plywood and a few 1x4s that I ripped into stringers. I made two temporary bulkheads from the plywood, one for each end. Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo.
After the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade.
After the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads. When the flox cured the bondo joints were broken, again being careful not to harm the wood. The turtledeck was removed from the fuselage and 2 inch tapes added to the bulkheads inside and out.
At this point the turtledeck looked great and only weighed about 5lbs. but I noticed you could deform the skin by pushing hard on the outside. So I flipped the turtledeck over and from 1/4 inch last-a-foam, I cut two inch wide strips that would run the entire length, forward and aft inside the turtledeck. In effect these would act as composite stringers, I made enough of these two inch wide strips to make up three stringers. One down the center (sort of a backbone) and one on each side of the ""backbone"" half the distance to the edge of the turtledeck. I sanded the edge of the foam so that when covered with a layer of bid @ 45degrees there would be a nice transition from the turtledeck skin up onto the foam and then back onto the turtledeck I scuff sanded and glued the foam stringers in with micro. I covered the foam stringers with one layer of 8oz bid @ 45degrees.

Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 &KR-2 series planes. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built. The problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are ""foreshortened"" and don't give the proper shape. What needs to be done is to ""develop"" the ""true"" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in plane strain. The main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. This is mainly to obtain the ability to ""fair"" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape. The next article in the series will discuss jigging and building techniques to ensure alignment and strai. The layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time.

KR2 builders tend to be innovative, which leads to interesting mods that the KR2 has. The KR2 is a case in point: Many who'd heard of the pitch and tightness of the cabin of theKR2 began to modify the plans to suit their needs. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport. Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident.  KR Forum featured guest speakers Mike Stearns, Steve Trentman, and Bill Marcey. Les Palmer's KR2 N202LP won Best KR2, Best Engine Installation, and People's Choice awards at the 1995 KR Gathering at Columbia, TN. The KR2 is stretched 2"" between firewall and main spar, and 14"" behind the main spar. The fuselage is made from Douglas fir, which weighs in at 4 lbs heavier than if constructed from spruce. Les's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy Hegy. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6"" Cleveland calipers for braking. The cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. The KR-2S was designed by Rand Robinson in the 1980s. The plane was designed to fly at speeds of up to 180 mph. It was designed with low ground clearance and a large fuselage. It has been partially built by a team of four people. The project has been in the works for more than 20 years and is still in the planning stages. It is not yet clear if the plane will ever be fully built by Robinsons' team.

CNN.com's John Sutter sat down with a group of friends to try to find a way to get to the top of the list. Sutter started out by looking at the glass work on the turtle back. He found that the aileron bellcranks were not built or installed as per plans, but found that they looked professional. He decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the new set of wings and still be way ahead of the rest of the group. Now for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with that I didn't know any of the people at the center of the story about. The top 10 list: ""Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough. Some by ignorance and some by not looking very close enough."" The bottom 10 list includes: ""I found a small linear crack in the lower left wing cap on the left wing stub,"" and ""I didn't find anything else that might be questionable about the right-side of the wall"" Le towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in. Or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap. Also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem. I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels andbrakes even though the set for this set was four years old and in the original builders name. Their only receipt was over receipt was a receipt for the set that was over four yearsold and in their co-owner's name. The problem was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer. This article is intended to feature some of the problems that you may run into in buying someone else's project. The canopy turned out to have been blow a little too large. The main problem was that the canopy is stretched thin enough that it can be easily pushed in with one hand when the weather is warm. The jig was constructed from scrap plywood and a few 1x4s that I ripped into stringers. I made two temporary bulkheads from the plywood, one for each end. Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead need to be. As far as location, I placed my aft Bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondoed to the jig. I used the stringers I ripped from the 1x 4s and gave me a male poster form to cover with thin plastic or plastic. This was the only form of cover I could find that was thin enough to cover. After the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig. The fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads. When the flox cured the bondo joints were broken, again being careful not to harm the wood. The turtledeck looked great and only weighed about 5lbs. But I noticed you could deform the skin by pushing hard on the outside. So I flipped the turtlingeck over and from 1/4 inch last-a-foam, I cut two inch wide strips that would run the entire length, forward and aft. In effect these would act as composite stringers. I covered the foam stringers with one layer of 8oz bid @ 45degrees. I scuff sanded and glued the foamstringers in with micro. board. You can also send me email at mikemims@pacbell.net if you have any questions or want to share your ideas."

Got o have a penis to be an expert
Thursday on NPR's Fresh Air, Terry Gross wanted to talk film and music. Since women don't know a thing about either and aren't interested in either, Terry had to find men who were 'experts.'This is C.I.'s "" Iraq snapshot Friday, December 24, 2010. Chaos and violence continue, Nouri's incomplete Cabinet continues to receive criticism, a father offers an 'excuse' for killing his own daughter, and more.Marci Stone (US Headlines Examiner) reports, ""Friday afternoon, Santa is currently in Baghdad, Iraq and on his next stop is Moscow, Russia, according to the 2010 NORAD Santa Tracker. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) has been tracking Santa as he makes his annual journey throughout the world."" Gerald Skoning (Palm Beach Post) quotes Santa saying, ""We send our special wishes for peace and goodwill to all. That includes the people of Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea."" Please note that this is Santa's seventh trip to Iraq since the start of the Iraq War and, as usual, his journey was known in advance. No waiting until he hit the ground to announce he was going to Iraq -- the way George The Bully Boy Bush had to and the way US President Barack Obama still has to. In the lead up to Santa's yearly visit, many 'authorities' in Iraq began insisting that Christmas couldn't be celebrated publicly, that even Santa was banned. Gabriel Gatehouse (BBC News) quotes Shemmi Hanna stating, ""I wasn't hurt but I wish that I had been killed. I wish I had become a martyr for this church, but God kept me alive for my daughters."" Shemmi Hanna was in Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad when it was assaulted October 31st and she lost her husband, her son, her daughter-in-law and her infant grandson in the attack. The October 31st attack marks the latest wave of violence targeting Iraqi Christians. The violence has led many to flee to northern Iraq (KRG) or to other countries. Zvi Bar'el (Haaretz) notes, ""This week the Iraqi legislature discussed the Christians' situation and passed a resolution in principle to help families who fled. However, the parliament does not know where the Christians are, how many are still in Iraq, in their homes, and how many have found asylum in Iraqi Kurdistan."" John Leland (New York Times) reports:The congregants on Friday night were fewer than 100, in a sanctuary built for four or five times as many. But they were determined. This year, even more than in the past, Iraqi's dwindling Christian minority had reasons to stay home for Christmas. ""Yes, we are threatened, but we will not stop praying,"" the Rev. Meyassr al-Qaspotros told the Christmas Eve crowd at the Sacred Church of Jesus, a Chaldean Catholic church. ""We do not want to leave the country because we will leave an empty space."" Raheem Salman (Los Angeles Times) reports, ""Rimon Metti's family will go to Christian services on Christmas Day, but his relatives will be praying for their own survival and wondering whether this is their last holiday season in Baghdad. If they had any grounds for optimism about the future of their faith in Iraq, it vanished this year amid repeated attacks on fellow believers."" Shahsank Bengali (McClatchy Newspapers) adds, ""Nearly two months after a shocking assault by Islamist militants, Our Lady of Salvation Catholic Church will commemorate Christmas quietly, with daytime mass and prayers for the dead, under security fit more for a prison than a house of worship. It is the same at Christian churches across Baghdad and northern Iraq, where what's left of one of the world's oldest Christian communities prepares to mark perhaps the most somber Christmas since the start of the Iraq war.""Meanwhile Taylor Luck (Jordan Times) reports on Iraqi refugees in Jordan:Although the calendar will say December 25, for Theresa, Saturday will not be Christmas. There will be no cinnamon klecha cooling on the dining room table, no outdoor ceramic nativity scene, no readings of hymns with relatives. The 63-year-old Iraqi woman has even refused to put up Christmas lights in the crowded two-room Amman hotel apartment she has called home since fleeing Baghdad last month.""There is no holiday spirit. All we have is fear,"" she said.This holiday will instead mark another year without news from her 46-year-old son, who was kidnapped outside Baghdad in late 2006.From Turkey, Sebnem Arsu (New York Times -- link has text and video) notes the increase in Iraq refugees to the country since October 31st and quotes Father Emlek stating, ""I've never seen as many people coming here as I have in the last few weeks. They also go to Lebanon, Jordan and Syria but it seems that Turkey is the most popular despite the fact that they do not speak the language."" Jeff Karoub (AP) reports on the small number of Iraqi refugees who have made it to the US and how some of them ""struggle with insomnia, depression and anxiety.""One group in Iraq who can openly celebrate Christmas are US service members who elect to. Barbara Surk (AP) reports that tomorrow Chief Warrant Officer Archie Morgan will celebrate his fourth Christmas in Iraq and Captain Diana Crane is celebrating her second Christmas in Iraq: ""Crane was among several dozen troops attending a Christmas Eve mass in a chapel in Camp Victory, an American military base just outside Baghdad."" Marc Hansen (Des Moines Reigster) speaks with six service members from Iowa who are stationed in Iraq. Sgt 1st Class Dennis Crosser tells Hansen, ""I certainly understand from reading the paper what's going on in Afghanistan and the attention definitely needs to be on the troops there. But everyone serving here in Operation New Dawn appreciates a little bit of attention as we finish this up.""Today Jiang Yu, China's Foreign Minister, issued the following statement, ""We welcome and congratulate Iraq on forming a new government. We hope that the Iraqi Government unite all its people, stabilize the security situation, accelerate economic reconstruction and make new progress in building its country."" James Cogan (WSWS) reports:US State Department official Philip Crowley declared on Wednesday that Washington had not ""dictated the terms of the government"". In reality, constant American pressure was applied to Maliki, Allawi, Kurdish leaders and other prominent Iraqi politicians throughout the entire nine-month process to form a cabinet. The US intervention included numerous personal phone calls and visits to Baghdad by both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.The key objective of the Obama administration has been to ensure that the next Iraqi government will ""request"" a long-term military partnership with the US when the current Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) expires at the end of 2011. The SOFA is the legal basis upon which some 50,000 American troops remain in Iraq, operating from large strategic air bases such as Balad and Tallil and Al Asad. US imperialism spent billions of dollars establishing these advanced bases as part of its wider strategic plans and has no intention of abandoning them.Cogan's only the second person to include the SOFA in his report. Some are impressed with the 'feat' of taking nearly ten months to form a government, stringing the country along for ten months while no decisions could go through. The editorial board of the Washington Post, for example, was full of praise yesterday. Today they're joined by Iran's Ambassador to Iraq, Hassan Danaiifar. The Tehran Times reports that Danaiifar was full of praise today hailing the ""positive and final step which ended the 10-month political limbo in Iraq."" However, Danaiifar was less pie-in-the-sky than the Post editorial board because he can foresee future problems as evidenced by his statement, ""We may witness the emergence of some problems after one and half of a year -- for example, some ministers may be impeached."" Of course, there are already many clouds on the horizon, even if Iranian diplomats and Post editorial boards can't suss them out. For example, Ben Bendig (Epoch Times) noted the objection of Iraq's female politicians to Nouri al-Maliki's decision to nominate only one woman (so far) to his Cabinet: ""Some 50 female lawmakers went to the country's top leadership, the United Nations and the Arab League to voice their concern and desire for increased representation."" BNO notes that protest and also that a group of Iraqi MPs are alleging that Iraqiya bought seats in the Cabinet via money exchanged in Jordan. UPI adds, ""Maliki, a Shiite who has a long history of working with Tehran, has named himself acting minister of defense, interior and national security, three most powerful and sensitive posts in the government he is stitching together. Although Maliki appears to be bending over backward to accommodate rivals among Iraq's Shiite majority as well as minority Sunnis and Kurds in his administration in a spirit of reconciliation, he is unlikely to relinquish those ministries that dominate the security sector."" DPA reports, ""Sheikh Abdel-Mahdi al-Karbalaei, a confident of influential Shiite spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, said that the new cabinet is 'below the standards' Iraqi citizens had hoped for and suggested it could prove to be weaker than the previous government."" Ranj Alaaldin (Guardian) also spots clouds on the horizon:Lasting peace and stability depends on resolving outstanding disputes with the Kurds on oil, revenue-sharing, security and the disputed territories (Kirkuk in particular). The Kurds, rather than exploiting their kingmaker position to take a stronger proportion of ministries in Baghdad (they are taking just one major portfolio – the foreign ministry), are instead banking on guarantees from Maliki to implement their list of 19 demands that includes resolving the above disputes in their favour.They may have been naive, though. With their historical and federalist partners, the Islamic supreme council of Iraq in decline, the Kurds may be isolated in the new government – a government dominated by the nationalistic and centrist characteristics of the INM, the Sadrists and indeed State of Law.Maliki may, therefore, turn out to be unable to grant concessions even if he wanted to and could use Osama Nujayfi, the new ultra-nationalist speaker of parliament and Kurdish foe, to absorb the Kurdish criticism and insulate himself from any attacks.AP reports that Iraqi police sought out a 19-year-old woman because of rumors that she was working with al Qaida in Mesopotamia only to be greeted with the news that her father allegedly killed her and the father showed the police where he buried the woman . . . last month. The story begs for more than it offers. The most obvious observation is: what does it say that a woman's allegedly killed by her father and no one says a word for over a month? After that, it should probably be noted that there are many men in Iraq killing women who, no doubt, would love to also be able to pin the blame on al Qaida. In other violence, Reuters notes a house bombing in Haswa which claimed the life of Mohammed al-Karrafi, ""his wife, two sons and a nephew"" -- as well as injuring four more people, and a Samarra roadside bombing which claimed the lives of 2 police officers. DPA notes it was two homes bombed in Haswa and that the Samarra roadside bombing also injured four Iraqi soldiers. Jomana Karadsheh (CNN) reports, ""Another policeman was wounded in Baghdad Friday night when a roadside bomb detonated by a police patrol, an Interior Ministry official told CNN.""And we'll close with this from Peace Mom Cindy Sheehan's latest Al Jazeera column:The recent repeal of the US military policy of ""Don't ask, don't tell"" is far from being the human rights advancement some are touting it to be. I find it intellectually dishonest, in fact, illogical on any level to associate human rights with any military, let alone one that is currently dehumanising two populations as well as numerous other victims of it's clandestine ""security"" policies.Placing this major contention aside, the enactment of the bill might be an institutional step forward in the fight for ""equality""; however institutions rarely reflect reality.Do we really think that the US congress vote to repeal the act and Obama signing the bill is going to stop the current systemic harassment of gays in the military?While I am a staunch advocate for equality of marriage and same-sex partnership, I cannot - as a peace activist - rejoice in the fact that now homosexuals can openly serve next to heterosexuals in one of the least socially responsible organisations that currently exists on earth: The US military.It is an organisation tainted with a history of intolerance towards anyone who isn't a Caucasian male from the Mid-West. Even then I'm sure plenty fitting that description have faced the terror and torment enshrined into an institution that transforms the pride and enthusiasm of youth into a narrow zeal for dominating power relations.And we'll close with this from Francis A. Boyle's ""2011: Prospects for Humanity?"" (Global Research):Historically, this latest eruption of American militarism at the start of the 21st Century is akin to that of America opening the 20th Century by means of the U.S.-instigated Spanish-American War in 1898. Then the Republican administration of President William McKinley stole their colonial empire from Spain in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines; inflicted a near genocidal war against the Filipino people; while at the same time illegally annexing the Kingdom of Hawaii and subjecting the Native Hawaiian people (who call themselves the Kanaka Maoli) to near genocidal conditions. Additionally, McKinley's military and colonial expansion into the Pacific was also designed to secure America's economic exploitation of China pursuant to the euphemistic rubric of the ""open door"" policy. But over the next four decades America's aggressive presence, policies, and practices in the ""Pacific"" would ineluctably pave the way for Japan's attack at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 194l, and thus America's precipitation into the ongoing Second World War. Today a century later the serial imperial aggressions launched and menaced by the Republican Bush Jr. administration and now the Democratic Obama administration are threatening to set off World War III. By shamelessly exploiting the terrible tragedy of 11 September 2001, the Bush Jr. administration set forth to steal a hydrocarbon empire from the Muslim states and peoples living in Central Asia and the Persian Gulf under the bogus pretexts of (1) fighting a war against international terrorism; and/or (2) eliminating weapons of mass destruction; and/or (3) the promotion of democracy; and/or (4) self-styled ""humanitarian intervention."" Only this time the geopolitical stakes are infinitely greater than they were a century ago: control and domination of two-thirds of the world's hydrocarbon resources and thus the very fundament and energizer of the global economic system – oil and gas. The Bush Jr./ Obama administrations have already targeted the remaining hydrocarbon reserves of Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia for further conquest or domination, together with the strategic choke-points at sea and on land required for their transportation. In this regard, the Bush Jr. administration announced the establishment of the U.S. Pentagon's Africa Command (AFRICOM) in order to better control, dominate, and exploit both the natural resources and the variegated peoples of the continent of Africa, the very cradle of our human species. This current bout of U.S. imperialism is what Hans Morgenthau denominated ""unlimited imperialism"" in his seminal work Politics Among Nations (4th ed. 1968, at 52-53): The outstanding historic examples of unlimited imperialism are the expansionist policies of Alexander the Great, Rome, the Arabs in the seventh and eighth centuries, Napoleon I, and Hitler. They all have in common an urge toward expansion which knows no rational limits, feeds on its own successes and, if not stopped by a superior force, will go on to the confines of the political world. This urge will not be satisfied so long as there remains anywhere a possible object of domination--a politically organized group of men which by its very independence challenges the conqueror's lust for power. It is, as we shall see, exactly the lack of moderation, the aspiration to conquer all that lends itself to conquest, characteristic of unlimited imperialism, which in the past has been the undoing of the imperialistic policies of this kind…. On 10 November 1979 I visited with Hans Morgenthau at his home in Manhattan. It proved to be our last conversation before he died on 19 July 1980. Given his weakened physical but not mental condition and his serious heart problem, at the end of our necessarily abbreviated one-hour meeting I purposefully asked him what he thought about the future of international relations. iraqbbc newsgabriel gatehousethe new york timesjohn lelandhaaretzzvi bar'elthe jordan timestaylor luckthe associated pressjeff karoubthe los angeles timesraheem salmancnnjomana karadsheh
Terry thinks she's a man
Yesterday on NPR's Fresh Air the hour went to a male TV critic. It's always a man with Terry. Always. And somebody tell her that a snotty, snooty TV critic really doesn't make for good programming.This is C.I.'s ""Iraq snapshot:"" Thursday, December 23, 2010. Chaos and violence continue, Iraqi women make clear their displeasure over the Cabinet make up, Daniel Ellsberg and Veterans for Peace get some recognition, and more. Last Thursday a protest held outside the White House. One of the organizers was Veterans for Peace and Pentagon Papers whistle blower Daniel Ellsberg participated and spoke. Juana Bordas (Washington Post) advocates for both of them to be named persons of the year: Veterans for Peace and Daniel Ellsberg should be this year's person of the year because of their courage and bravery to stand up for all of us who believe that ""war is not the answer."" Moreover in a time of economic recession, the war machine is bankrupting our country. As John Amidon, a Marine Corps veteran from Albany asked at the White House protest, ""How is the war economy working for you?""While unemployment rates hover near 10 percent, there is no doubt that the U.S. economy and quality of life is faltering. Worldwide we are 14th in education, 37th in the World Health Organization's ranking on medical systems, and 23rd in the U.N. Environmental Sustainability Index on being most livable and greenest benefits. There is one place we take the undeniable world lead. The US military spending accounts for a whopping 46.5 percent of world military spending--the next ten countries combined come in at only 20.7 percent. Linda Pershing (Truthout) reports, ""Responding to a call from the leaders of Stop These Wars(1) - a new coalition of Veterans for Peace and other activists - participants came together in a large-scale performance of civil resistance. A group of veterans under the leadership of Veterans for Peace members Tarak Kauff, Will Covert and Elaine Brower, mother of a Marine who has served three tours of duty in Iraq, sponsored the event with the explicit purpose of putting their bodies on the line. Many participants were Vietnam War veterans; others ranged from Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans in their 20s and 30s to World War II vets in their 80s and older. They were predominately white; men outnumbered women by at least three to one. After a short rally in Lafayette Park, they formed a single-file procession, walking across Pennsylvania Avenue to the solemn beat of a drum. As they reached the police barricade (erected to prevent them from chaining themselves to the gate, a plan they announced on their web site), the activists stood shoulder to shoulder, their bodies forming a human link across the 'picture postcard' tableau in front of the White House."" Maria Chutchian (Arlington Advocate) quotes, participant Nate Goldshlag (Vietnam veteran) stating, """"There was a silent, single file march around Lafayette Park to a drum beat. Then we went in front of the White House,. There were barricades set up in front of white house fence. So when we got there, we jumped over barricades and were able to get right next to the White House fence."" Participant Linda LeTendre (Daily Gazette) reports: At the end of the rally, before the silent, solemn procession to the White House fence, in honor of those killed in Iraq and Afghan wars of lies and deceptions, the VFP played taps and folded an American flag that had been left behind at a recent funeral for the veteran of one of those wars. Two attendees in full dress uniform held and folded the flag. I had the image of all of the people who stood along the roads and bridges when the bodies of the two local men, Benjamin Osborn and David Miller, were returned to the Capital District. I thought if all of those people were here now or spoke out against war these two fine young men might still be with us.I was blessed enough to be held in custody with one of those in uniform; a wonderful young man who had to move from his hometown in Georgia because no one understood why as a veteran he was against these wars. Even his family did not understand. (He remains in my prayers.)Our plan was to attach ourselves to the White House fence until President Obama came out and talked to us or until we were arrested and dragged away. I don't have to tell you how it ended.Mr. Ellsberg was one of 139 people arrested at that action. We've noted the protest in pretty much every snapshot since last Thursday. If something else comes out that's worth noting on the protest, we'll include it. We will not include people who don't have their facts and it's really sad when they link to, for example, Guardian articles and the links don't even back them up. It's real sad, for example, when they're trashing Hillary (big strong men that they are) and ripping her apart and yet Barack? ""Obama's inaccurate statements""??? What the hell is that? You're inferring he lied, say so. Don't be such a little chicken s**t. It's especially embarrasing when you're grandstanding on 'truth.' Especially when you're the little s**t that clogged up the public e-mail account here in the summer of 2008 whining that you were holding Barack to a standard, then admitting that you weren't, then whining that if you did people would be mean to you. Oh, that's sooooooo sad. Someone might say something bad about you. The horror. You must suffer more than all the people in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. While the action took place in DC, actions also took place in other cities. We've already noted NYC's action this week, Doug Kaufmann (Party for Socialism & Liberation) reports on the Los Angeles action: Despite heavy rain, over 100 people gathered in Los Angeles on the corner of Hollywood and Highland to demand an end to the U.S. wars on Afghanistan and Iraq. People came from as far as Riverside to protest, braving what Southern California media outlets have dubbed the ""storm of the decade."" The demonstration, initiated and led by the ANSWER Coalition, broke the routine of holiday shopping and garnered support from activists and even passers by, who joined in chanting ""Money for jobs and education -- not for war and occupation!"" and ""Occupation is a crime -- Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine!"" Protesters held banners reading, ""U.S./NATO Out of Afghanistan!"" and ""Yes to jobs, housing and education -- no to war, racism and occupation!""Speakers at the demonstration included representatives of Korean Americans for Peace, ANSWER Coalition, KmB Pro-People Youth, Veterans for Peace, Party for Socialism and Liberation and National Lawyers Guild. Tuesday, Nouri al-Maliki managed to put away the political stalemate thanks to a lot of Scotch -- tape to hold the deal together and booze to keep your eyes so crossed you don't question how someone can claim to have formed a Cabinet when they've left over ten positions to be filled at a later date. One group speaking out is women. Bushra Juhi and Qassmi Abdul-Zahra (AP) report, ""Iraq's female lawmakers are furious that only one member of the country's new Cabinet is a woman and are demanding better representation in a government that otherwise has been praised by the international community for bringing together the country's religious sects and political parties."" As noted Tuesday, though represenation in Parliament is addressed in Iraq's Constitution, there is nothing to address women serving in the Cabinet. Aseel Kami (Reuters) notes one of the most damning aspects of Nouri's chosen men -- a man is heaing the Ministry of Women's Affairs. Iraqiya's spokesperson Maysoon Damluji states, ""There are really good women who could do wel . . . they cannot be neglected and marginalized."" Al-Amal's Hanaa Edwar states, ""They call it a national (power) sharing government. So where is the sharing? Do they want to take us back to the era of the harem? Do they want to take us back to the dark ages, when women were used only for pleasure."" Deborah Amos (NPR's All Things Considered) reports that a struggle is going on between secular impulses and fundamentalist ones. Gallery owner Qasim Sabti states, ""We know it's fighting between the religious foolish man and the civilization man. We know we are fighting like Gandhi, and this is a new language in Iraqi life. We have no guns. We do not believe in this kind of fighting."" Deborah Amos is the author of Eclipse of the Sunnis: Power, Exile, and Upheaval in the Middle East. Meanwhile Nizar Latif (The National) reports that distrust is a common reaction to the new government in Baghdad and quotes high school teacher Hussein Abed Mohammad stating, ""Promises were made that trustworthy, competent people would be ministers this time around, but it looks as if everything has just been divided out according to sectarian itnerests. No attention has been paid to forming a functioning government, it is just a political settlement of vested interests. I'm sure al Maliki will have the same problems in his next four years as he had in the last four years."" Days away from the ten months mark, Nouri managed to finally end the stalemate. Some try to make sense of it and that must have been some office party that the editorial board of the Washington Post is still coming down from judging by ""A good year in Iraq."" First up, meet the new Iraqi Body Count -- an organization that provides cover for the war and allows supporters of the illegal war to point to it and insist/slur ""Things aren't so bad!"" Sure enough, the editorial board of the Post does just that noting the laughable ""civilian deaths"" count at iCasualities. As we noted -- long, long before we walked away from that crap ass website, they're not doing a civilian count.",['It provides cover for the war and allows supporters of the illegal war to point to it.'],4467,multifieldqa_en,en,,048c12357868d908dfb979ef3c5c6cf7f6d85053acf1cac4," This is C.I.I.'s "" Iraq snapshot Friday, December 24, 2010.

US imperialism spent billions of dollars establishing these advanced bases as part of its wider strategic plans and has no intention of abandoning them. Nouri al-Maliki's new cabinet is 'below the standards' Iraqi citizens had hoped for. Peace Mom Cindy Sheehan: The repeal of the US military policy of ""Don't ask, don't tell"" is far from being the human rights advancement some are touting it to be. In other violence, Reuters notes a house bombing in Haswa which claimed the life of Mohammed al-Karrafi, ""his wife, two sons and a nephew"" -- as well as injuring four more people. A Samarra roadside bombing claimed the lives of 2 police officers. And a 19-year-old woman was allegedly killed by her father and no one says a word for over a month. It should probably be noted that there are many men in Iraq killing women who, no doubt, would love to also be able to pin the blame on al Qaida. They may be isolated in the new government – a government dominated by the nationalistic and centrist characteristics of the INM, the Sadrists and indeed State of Law. Do we really think that the US congress vote to repeal the act and Obama signing the bill is going to stop the current systemic harassment of gays in the military? While I am a staunch advocate for equality of marriage and same-sex partnership, I cannot rejoice in the fact that now homosexuals can openly serve next to heterosexuals. The US military is an organisation tainted with a history of intolerance towards anyone who isn't a Caucasian male from the Mid-West. This current bout of U.S. imperialism is what Hans Morgenthau denominated ""unlimited imperialism"" in his seminal work Politics Among Nations (4th ed. 1968, at 52-53): The outstanding historic examples of unlimited imperialism are the expansionist policies of Alexander the Great, Rome, the Arabs in the seventh and eighth centuries, Napoleon I, and Hitler. They all hav. all haved. The serial imperial aggressions launched and menaced by the Republican Bush Jr. administration and now the Democratic Obama administration are threatening to set off World War III.

Terry Jones thinks she's a man yesterday on NPR's Fresh Air the hour went to a male TV critic. It's always a man with Terry. Always. And somebody tell her that a snotty, snooty TV critic really doesn't make for good programming. The U.S. military spending accounts for a whopping 46.5 percent of world military spending--the next ten countries combined come in at only 20.7 percent. As John Amidon, a Marine Corps veteran from Albany asked, ""How is the war economy working for you?"" While unemployment rates hover near 10 percent, there is no doubt that the U.s. economy and quality of life is faltering. There is one place we take the undeniable world lead.

abstract

Robots that can effectively understand human intentions from actions are crucial for successful human-robot collaboration. In this work, we address the challenge of a robot navigating towards an unknown goal while also accounting for a human's preference for a particular path in the presence of obstacles.
This problem is particularly challenging when both the goal and path preference are unknown a priori. To overcome this challenge, we propose a method for encoding and inferring path preference online using a partitioning of the space into polytopes. Our approach enables joint inference over the goal and path preference using a stochastic observation model for the human.
We evaluate our method on an unknown-goal navigation problem with sparse human interventions, and find that it outperforms baseline approaches as the human's inputs become increasingly sparse. We find that the time required to update the robot's belief does not increase with the complexity of the environment, which makes our method suitable for online applications.

INTRODUCTION

Collaboration between humans and robots has become increasingly important and one key aspect of this collaboration is the ability for robots to adapt to human decisions. In many scenarios, such as a robot navigating through a busy room to deliver an item, it is important for the robot to take into account human preferences.
For instance, humans may prefer a specific path that would allow their colleagues to notice the item being delivered, but this preference may change dynamically based on various factors such as changes in the environment or unforeseen circumstances. While some preferences can be incorporated into the path-planning process, accommodating dynamic user preferences in real-time remains challenging.
In this paper, we propose a way to enable robots to adapt to human preferences dynamically by leveraging real-time feedback to inform decision-making. In this work, we tackle the problem of robot navigation in which the robot cannot observe the goal or the preferred path to the goal, but must make navigation decisions that are influenced by humans through recommended actions.
Prior work has explored how to adapt to a human's preference through feedback, but such approaches often require a high level of intervention, which can be time-consuming and impractical in real-world scenarios. To optimize the use of human input and quickly infer the human's preference, Fig. : An autonomous robot navigates in a simulated classroom towards a goal location (pink circle).
At the start of its mission, it receives direction indications (arrows) from a human that indicate which path it should take to get to the goal. In this scenario, the human wants the robot to go around the desks on the right side of the classroom. A robot that does not reason over path preferences (green) will take the shortest path to the goal regardless of the human's input.
Our method (blue) infers the human's path preference from these indications and adapts to their recommendations. we propose an approach that leverages probabilistic representations of human preference and incorporates real-time feedback. Previous research by Bajcsy et al. considered an online adaptation problem in a manipulation task, where the person can apply forces to the robot to indicate their preferences.
By allowing the robot to continue its task while taking into account a probabilistic representation of human preference, their approach does not require frequent inputs. Building on this idea, we adopt a similar approach to adapt to a human's preference in the context of a robot autonomously navigating through a known environment, such as a cluttered office space.
Specifically, we focus on allowing the human to influence the robot's trajectory with respect to obstacles, by providing guidance on preferred routes or paths, while the robot continues to execute its task. Paths can be represented using homotopy classes . However, homotopies can pose computational challenges when used to encode and infer human preferences.
When the robot maintains a belief over homotopy classes, the inference problem can become exponentially complex with the number of obstacles in the space. Additionally, when the goal is unknown, the number of variables increases with the number of candidate destinations. This complexity can render the decision-making problem intractable.
Our solution is to encode path preference based on a partitioning of the environment into polytopes . This representation allows path preferences to be expressed as sets of preferred transitions between adjacent polytopes. Paths belonging to different homotopy classes correspond to different sequences of transitions.
By leveraging conditional independence assumptions, we can make the Bayesian inference problem tractable. These assumptions exploit the fact that human actions provide information about the path in a piece-wise manner. For example, indicating a preference for navigating around a particular obstacle only provides information about the local area and not the entire path.
Finally, after updating its belief representation over the human's preference, the robot can adapt to indications by replanning online. Our contributions are as follows. • We formulate the human-robot collaboration problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) where both the goal of the task and the human's path preference are unknown random variables.
• We propose an encoding of a human's path preference using a partitioning of the environment into polytopes, along with conditional independence assumptions that make the Bayesian inference problem tractable to infer the task goal and path preference online. • Through simulations in two environments of different sizes and complexity, we show that our method is effective for solving problems where the robot must reach a goal that is unknown a-priori while simultaneously adapting to a human's indications.
Our method shows higher success rates compared to baseline approaches when the human inputs are sparse. Our approach enables a robot to make effective navigation decisions in collaboration with a human, even when the goal and path preference are not known in advance, and with minimal human input. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in shared autonomy and interactive systems, where humans and robots work together to accomplish tasks.
Several approaches have been proposed to address the challenge of enabling effective collaboration between human and robot agents while still achieving high task performance. Losey et al. and Jeon, Losey, and Sadigh propose a framework where a human operator is given control of a task-relevant latent action space while an autonomous system handles the rest.
Dragan and Srinivasa present a formalism for arbitrating between a user's input and a robot's policy when both human and robot share control of the same action space. Cognetti et al. [7] provide a method for real-time modifications of a path, . . . Fig. : We model the intent inference problem with the above diagram.
At each step in time, the robot receives an observation ot from the human conditioned on its current location st, the intended goal g, and the human's path preference θ. The robot updates its belief over g and θ and transitions to a next location st+1. while Hagenow et al. present a method that allows an outside agent to modify key robot state variables and blends the changes with the original control.
However, a common challenge of these approaches is the high level of intervention required from humans. Best and Fitch propose a method for predicting an agent's intended trajectory from observations. Rather than maintaining a belief over the agent's future path, they infer the agent's intended goal among a set of candidate locations at the boundary of the space.
This approach provides information on where the agent is heading and generates a distribution of candidate future trajectories for the agent. Inferring the goal of the task among a discrete set of candidates is also relevant to the area of shared autonomy. Javdani, Srinivasa, and Bagnell propose a formalism for shared control of a robotic arm, where the robot must assist the human in picking up an object but needs to infer which object the human has chosen from joystick inputs.
Planning with homotopy class constraints is useful in problems where the robot's requirements are given with respect to obstacles, and Yi, Goodrich, and Seppi consider topological constraints provided by human operators. Bhattacharya propose an efficient algorithm for solving pathplanning problems under homotopic constraints.
However, the number of homotopy classes for a given problem can be infinite, and as the robot changes location and updates its representation of the world, carrying out inference over homotopy classes in a dynamic environment requires recomputing the set of homotopies at every iteration, making the belief update challenging.
Prior work has addressed the challenge of shared autonomy by considering how robots can infer a human's intended goal, or how they can infer the preferred path to a goal. However, we argue that inferring the goal and the path as separate problems can lead to over-confidence in incorrect beliefs about the user's preferences.
To illustrate this point, consider the following scenario: a robot and a human are collaborating to move an object from one end of a room to Fig. : Using the hyperplanes composing the H-representation of each obstacle, we construct a hyperplane arrangement of the obstacle-free space (a). We define the human's preference for the robot's one step action choices as the posterior distribution (given all human input up to that point) over transitions from the current to the neighboring polytopes, i.e. edges on the graph.
Each time the robot transitions to a new polytope, the set of neighbor polytopes and the distribution over human preferences are updated. another, but there is an obstacle in the way. The human would like the robot to take a path around the obstacle on the left, even though the goal is on the right. If the robot only infers the goal from the human's inputs, it may incorrectly assume that the goal is on the right, and become over-confident in this belief.
On the other hand, if the robot only infers the preferred path, it may mistakenly assume that the goal is on the left, leading to a failure in completing the task. To overcome these challenges, our work proposes a joint inference approach that considers both the human's intended goal and their preferred path to that goal.
Specifically, we model the human's preference over different homotopy classes and leverage a conditional independence assumption to provide a tractable solution. In our approach, we assume that the human's inputs are noisily rational conditioned on both the goal and the preference. By jointly inferring the goal and path preference, we can avoid over-confidence in incorrect beliefs about the user's preferences, leading to improved system performance.
We consider the problem of robot navigation in a known environment to an unknown destination, where a human can intervene and provide a heading direction to the robot using a joystick or force cues. The human also has a preference on which path the robot should take with respect to obstacles, and our objective is for the robot to understand the human's intentions and execute the task with minimal interventions.
Let g be a discrete random variable denoting the goal of the task, belonging to a set of candidates Ω g , and let θ be a discrete-valued random variable representing the human's path preference, belonging to a set of possible preferences Θ. The physical location of the robot at time index t is denoted by s t ∈ R 2 , and the robot's action at time index t, belonging to some action space A, is denoted by a t .
The transition model T (s t+1 | s t , a t ) is deterministic, meaning the robot has full control over its future location. At any time step, the human may provide an observation to the robot. When the human intervenes, the robot receives a direction (heading angle) that can be mapped to a future location in space.
More specifically, we map the direction to an intended location, which is the resulting robot location after advancing in the indicated direction for one time step. For simplicity, we consider that the robot directly makes an observation o t of the location indicated by the human. We assume that the robot has a stochastic observation model for the human P (o t | s t , g, θ) that is conditioned on both the goal of the task g and the human's preferred path θ.
We further assume that having chosen a goal and path preference, the human takes actions to noisily minimize a cost function C g,θ that measures the cost of moving from the robot's current location to the goal along the preferred path. For example, C g,θ (s t , o t ) can be the length of the shortest path from location s t to the goal g after taking a first step to o t , and constrained by path preference θ.
We use C g,θ to induce a probability distribution over observations, given by: where γ h is a hyperparameter that designates the rationality coefficient. This model assumes the human will pick the lowest cost action with the highest probability and the likelihood of an action decreases exponentially with the increase in cost .
Our inclusion of the path preference θ sets our approach apart from . The model is shown in fig. represented as a Bayesian Network.

Inference

At each time step where the human provides an observation, the posterior P (g, θ) is given through the Bayesian update We note that the number of Bayesian updates required at each iteration to update the belief is equal to the cardinality of Ω g × Θ. In addition, each Bayesian update involves computing C g,θ ( .
, . ) in eq. ( ), which involves solving an optimization problem (such as a shortest path problem). In section IV, we propose a specific encoding of preference θ for resolving eq. ( ), while ensuring the number of computations of the cost C g,θ (., .) per update does not grow exponentially with the number of obstacles.

Decision Making

We consider a navigation problem where the robot receives reward according to the model R(s t , g, θ, a t ). We wish to find the optimal policy π that maximizes the expected discounted sum of future rewards, with discount factor γ. The above problem is a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) .
In this section, we propose an encoding of human's path preference θ for computing the posterior in eq. ( ). Devifrom the concept of homotopy classes, we define the preference according to a partitioning of the environment into polytopes, as shown in fig. , creating a hyperplane arrangement of the space.
Hyperplane arrangements have been used by Vincent and Schwager in the context of Neural Network verification. In our setting, we leverage this representation to define path preferences as preferred transitions between adjacent regions of the space.

Hyperplane Arrangement

We assume a two-dimensional environment composed of m polytopic obstacles, each defined by their half-space representation (H-representation) where A i ∈ R di×2 and b i ∈ R di , and where d i is the number of edges (hyperplanes) composing polytope i. Let n = i d i be the total number of hyperplanes. We leverage each obstacle's H-representation to construct a hyperplane arrangement of the environment as shown in fig.
.e. a partitioning of the space into polytopes. More specifically, each location in space belongs to a polytope j for which we can write an H-representation of the form where α j i ∈ {−1, 1} di is a vector specific to polytope j and obstacle i corresponding to the relative position of any point in the set with respect to each hyperplane in O i .
Fig. : Intent inference model in a hyperplane arrangement of the obstacle free space. We spatially decompose the preference θ into a set of preferred neighboring polytopes per region of the space. Within each polytope j, the human preference pj is a discrete distribution over the preferred neighbor in N (j).
We assume that for a location st belonging to polytope j, and given goal g and preference pj, the observation ot and any other preference p i,i =j are conditionally independent. Concatenating elements from each obstacle's Hrepresentation, we can write polytope j's H-representation as where Some of the constraints in eq. ( ) (corresponding to rows of A, b and α j ) are redundant, i.e. the set P j does not change upon their removal.
We can further reduce the Hrepresentation of a polytope to include only non-redundant constraints. By removing the rows corresponding to redundant constraints, we obtain new matrices A j e , b j e and α j e such that we can write the polytope's reduced H-representation as The non-redundant constraints correspond to edges of the polytope.
In other words, as the robot continually moves in space, the first hyperplane that it will cross upon exiting the polytope will correspond to one of the polytope's nonredundant constraints. Vincent and Schwager outline an iterative method for removing redundant constraints by solving n linear programs.
We use this method in practice for computing α j e for each polytope. We can now characterize each polytope by a vector α j e ∈ {−1, 1} n j e , where n j e ≤ n is the number of essential constraints of the polytope. The polytopes P j partition the environment into a hyperplane arrangement.

Path Preference

In this section, we provide a definition of preference θ according to a graphical representation of the environment based on the hyperplane arrangement. Under this representation, a path preference corresponds to a set of preferred transitions. In other words, for each polytope in the space, the human will have a preference to which neighboring polytope they wish to transition.
Let G := (V, E) be an undirected graph, where vertices are obstacle-free polytopes, and edges connect two adjacent polytopes. Each polytope is described by a unique vector α j as defined in eq. ( ). Two polytopes are adjacent if they share non-redundant constraints (rows in eq. ( )) corresponding to the same hyperplane (i.e. they are on opposite sides of the hyperplane).
Let N (v) be the set of neighbors of a vertex v. For each vertex, we denote p v the discrete-valued random variable describing which edge in N (v) the human intends to transition to. Using this formalism, we define a path preference as the set of preferred transitions over all nodes in the graph, Let m θ = v∈V |N (v)| be the cardinality of Θ, and m g = |Ω g | the number of possible goals.
A priori, the number of Bayesian updates required to update the belief at every iteration should be m θ × m g . Now, let us assume the conditional independence relationships described by the new problem diagram in fig. . More specifically, we introduce the assumption that conditioned on a robot location s t , the goal g, and the preference for the corresponding vertex p v in the graph, the observation o t and the preference for any other vertex are conditionally independent.
In other words, the observations the human provides can be defined conditioned only on the robot location, the goal, and the human's preference for its current vertex p v . By introducing this assumption, each update step only requires updating the joint (p v , g), reducing the number of cost computations to |N (v)| × m g .
We can notice that by introducing this assumption, we removed the direct relationship between the number of polytopes in the environment and the complexity of the Bayesian update in eq. ( ). In practice, components of θ are not mutually independent. For example, if the human preference at a vertex v 1 is
, it is unlikely that the human will also prefer p v2 = (v 2 , v 1 ) (turning back). We can improve our model by assuming a dependent relationship between preferences for adjacent edges, which does not significantly increase the complexity of the inference problem. An interesting property of our encoding is that any two paths that belong to different homotopy classes will cross different sequences of polytopes, i.e. they correspond to a different sequence of edges on G.
This can be proved by contradiction. Let us suppose that two continuous trajectories ξ 1 and ξ 2 , with the same start and end points and that do not intersect any obstacle, traverse the same regions in G in the same order. From the construction of the hyperplane arrangement, each polytope that the paths traverse through is obstacle-free.
Therefore, within each polytope, there is no obstacle in the area located in between the portions of ξ 1 and ξ 2 that belong to the region. A smooth transformation of ξ 1 into ξ 2 can be obtained by transforming each portion of ξ 1 belonging to the polytopes it intersects into the corresponding portion of ξ 2 for the same polytopes, where the extremities of the trajectory portions are connected to one another along the polytope's edges (where the same edge is crossed by both paths).
Along this transformation, the paths do not intersect any obstacle, and therefore ξ 1 and ξ 2 belong to the same homotopy class.

EXPERIMENTS

We evaluate our model on a simulated navigation task where the robot must reach a goal that is unknown a priori while respecting the path preferences indicated by a human. The robot navigates in a grid world containing obstacles. The transition model is deterministic: the robot selects an adjacent location on the grid to reach at the next time step.
The robot is also allowed to take diagonal actions. Each location s t in the map can be mapped to a vertex v t ∈ G. Therefore, the actions leading to locations mapped to different vertices correspond to edges on the graph. We note f (s t , a t ) the edge crossed by taking action a t from location s t .
The robot is given a mission time limit T max for reaching the goal. In this problem, we assume that the human selects actions to noisily minimize a cost function C g,θ , where θ is defined as per eq. ( ), corresponding to the length of the shortest path to the goal constrained by the preference (where the robot is only allowed to make transitions on G along preferred edges).
More specifically, where δ(s t , g | o t , p vt ) designates the length of the shortest path from s t to g passing by o t and constrained by preference p vt . This is a slight variant of the cost function proposed by Best and Fitch , where we add in a conditioning on the path preference. We compute costs by running the A path planning algorithm on the environment maps (grid worlds with diagonal actions) and impose preference constraints by pruning invalid transitions from the search tree.
Reward model. At each step in time, the robot receives a reward which is a sum of three components: a goal-specific reward a preference-specific reward or penalty We compute solutions to the POMDP defined in section III-B with the online solver POMCP , and with the particularity that within the rollouts, the robot does not expect to collect human inputs.
Each time a solution is computed, the robot takes an action and may receive an observation. If it does, it updates its belief distribution over the unknown problem variables and resolves the POMDP over a receding horizon.

Baselines

• Goal only. The robot solves the POMDP while ignoring the effects of path preference. Similarly to , we assume the human is taking action to minimize a goaldependent cost C g (s t , o t ) = δ(s t , g | o t ), where the conditioning on the preference is removed. We also omit the path preference's contribution to the reward R pref .
• Compliant. The robot complies with the human input, but does not take an initiative. If the user stops providing information, the robot continues in the last direction indicated for 5 time steps (conserving its momentum), then stops. • Blended. We designed an arbitration function to decide between our proposed policy (accounting for path preferences) and the user's recommendation when the robot receives inputs.
Our metric to evaluate confidence in the robot's prediction for the purpose of arbitration is the entropy of the intention distribution H(g, p i ), where p i denotes the preferred neighbor for the current region. Because our representation of the world is discrete, the arbitration is given by a step function.
Denoted by U , the action corresponding to the human's input, and P , the robot's prediction for the optimal action, we write the policy where we chose h = 1.6 as the confidence threshold.

Results

When evaluating the algorithm, we consider that a run is successful if the robot reached the goal within its allocated mission time T max and only made transitions between graph vertices corresponding to the human's preferences. We vary the time delay between human inputs, from constant guidance (∆ T = 1) to only a single observation (∆ T ≥ T max ).
Success rates. Table I reports the success rates for experiments conducted over six randomly sampled problem instances and 50 runs per instance in Map 1 (fig. ). When the human provides inputs at every iteration, the compliant policy shows the highest success rates. However, as ∆ T increases, the compliant robot is not able to accomplish the task within the allotted time as it does not receive sufficient inputs to do so, and performance decreases compared to the autonomous baselines.
We find that in these runs, accounting for path preference consistently improves performance compared with the goal-only baseline. Results also show that blending the user's input with the robot's policy (Path Preference + Blend) when the human provides information leads to improved performance. Belief entropy.
Figure shows a challenging problem instance where the directions the human provides do not align directly with the shortest path to the goal. By ignoring the effects of preferences in the problem model (goal only), the robot quickly infers from observations that the upper left goal is less likely than others (P (g) drops).
The strong decrease in entropy shows that the robot becomes overconfident in this prediction. Overconfidence in an incorrect goal will prevent the agent from finding the correct goal once the human's indications directly align with it, as it needs to correct for the wrong predictions, as shown in the path realization (fig.
). In this realization, the goal-only method (green robot) fails to search the upper left area within the allotted time. By accounting for path preferences in its model, the blue robot's entropy over the goal distribution decreases more steadily, allowing for it to leverage the human's latest observations and reach the goal successfully.
shows an over-confident prediction (shown by the strong reduction in belief entropy) that the correct goal is less likely, making it more difficult to reach the correct goal compared to a method that accounts for path preference. Computation time. In table II we provide the time required to solve the POMDP, and the time required to update the robot's belief as it receives new observations.
We compute solutions on three maps: a simple 10 × 10 grid world with 8 polytopes (fig. ), a 10 × 10 grid world with 56 polytopes (fig. ), and a 20×20 grid world with 73 polytopes (fig. ). The latter environment being larger, we increase the mission time and the depth of the search tree in POMCP from T max = 30 (Map 1 and Map 2) to T max = 60 (Map 3).
We do not notice an increase in the time required to update the robot's belief with an increase in problem complexity, which is consistent with our observation that the complexity of the Bayesian update should not increase with the number of obstacles or polytopes. On the contrary, the belief update time on Map 2 and Map 3, containing more obstacles, is reduced compared to the first map.
More obstacles result in fewer iterations when solving the constrained shortest path problem with A . Adding constraints due to the obstacles and polytopes reduces the size of the A search tree. C. Limitations Simulation environments. In our simulations, we hardcoded the preference policy over the maps (e.g. in Map 1, go around the table counter-clockwise).
We randomly sampled problem instances (start and goal locations, and goal options) to reduce the bias introduced by these preference choices. To best evaluate and compare the different approaches, it would be best to sample preferences among a distribution of preferences chosen by a human (for example, from benchmarks resulting from a collection of data).
Creating such a benchmark is an interesting direction for future work. Hyperplane arrangement construction. The main limitation of our approach is that the size and geometry of each polytope depends strongly on the geometry of the obstacles, as seen in fig. . Because of this, the robot can make predictions over preferences that are too refined compared with the topology of the environment.
A direct consequence is that when the size of the polytopes is small, the information provided by the human can be incorrectly interpreted as a preference on the robot's immediate action. Our method can be improved by changing the structure of the hyperplane arrangement so that it relies on the topology of the environment, but does not vary strongly with the geometry of the features in the environment.
For this purpose, topometric maps and region construction algorithms are promising directions. We presented an approach for encoding and inferring a human's path preference in an environment with obstacles. By leveraging a partitioning of the space into polytopes and a stochastic observation model, our method allows for joint inference over the goal and path preference even when both are unknown a-priori.
Our experiments on an unknown-goal navigation problem with sparse human interventions demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its suitability for online applications. The time required to update the robot's belief does not increase with the complexity of the environment, which further highlights the practicality of our method.",['The time required to update the belief does not increase with the complexity of the environment.'],5665,multifieldqa_en,en,,aeb34faf1b5507b32d6d5b49474ea5c71d4ec2aa84a82d93," Robots that can understand human intentions are crucial for human-robot collaboration. We address the challenge of a robot navigating towards an unknown goal while avoiding obstacles. The goal is indicated with a pink circle, and the orange robot corresponds to the starting location. The blue robot follows a policy that accounts for path preference, while the green robot does not. The opacity of the robots increases with time. We evaluate computation time at the first iteration of each run (where the search depth takes on its highest Tmax). In this work, crucial value of successful human- robot collaboration is addressed. We present our proposed method to incorporate human path preferences in robot navigation with minimal interventions. We also present our results for the goal-only (green) and path preference (blue) solution methods. The results are averaged over 6 randomly sampled problem instances (start location, goal location, and goal possibilities), and over 50 runs per problem instance. The 95 % confidence interval is provided with the mean. The robot's mission time is Tmax = 30 time steps, corresponding to relatively noisy human inputs and making the problem more difficult to solve for the robot. This problem is particularly challenging when both the goal and path preference are unknown a priori. To overcome this challenge, we propose a method for encoding and inferring path preference online using a partitioning of the space into polytopes. We find that the time required to update the robot's belief does not increase with the complexity of the environment, which makes our method suitable for online applications. We evaluate our method on an unknown-goal navigation problem with sparse human interventions, and find that it outperforms baseline approaches as the human's inputs become increasingly sparse. We propose an approach that leverages probabilistic representations of human preference and incorporates real-time feedback to inform decision-making in real-world scenarios.

Back into the page that you came From: http://www.acS.com/news/features/2013/11/14/the-online-adaptation-problem-for-robots-and-human-preferences-and real-time-feedback-in-real-world-scenario. We propose an encoding of a human's path preference using a partitioning of the environment into polytopes. This representation allows path preferences to be expressed as sets of preferred transitions. After updating its belief representation over the human's preference, the robot can adapt to indications by replanning online. Our approach enables a robot to make effective navigation decisions in collaboration with a human, even when the goal and path preference are not known in advance. We show that our method is effective for solving problems where the robot must reach a goal that is unknown a-priori while simultaneously adapting to a human’s indications. Our method shows higher success rates compared to baseline approaches when the human inputs are sparse. We model the intent inference problem with the above diagram. At each step in time the robot receives an observation from the human conditioned on its current location st, the intended goal g, and the human s path preference θ. The robot updates its belief over g and θ and transitions to a next location st+1. Planning with homotopy class constraints is useful in problems where the robot's requirements are given with respect to obstacles. Yi, Goodrich, and Seppi consider topological constraints provided by human operators. They argue that inferring the goal and the path as separate problems can lead to over-confidence in incorrect beliefs about the user's preferences. They propose a joint inference approach that considers both the human's intended goal and their preferred path to that goal. The aim is for the robot to understand the human’s intentions and execute the task with minimal interventions. At any time step, the human may provide an observation to the robot. When the human intervenes, the robot receives a direction (heading angle) that  the robot receives. The transition model T (s t+1 | s t, a t ) is deterministic, meaning the robot has full control over its future location. The number of homotopic classes for a given problem can be infinite, and as the robot changes location and updates its representation of the world, carrying out inference over homotopies in a dynamic environment can be challenging. We consider a navigation problem where the robot receives reward according to the model R(s t, g, θ, a t ). We wish to find the optimal policy π that maximizes the expected discounted sum of future rewards. The above problem is a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). In section IV, we propose an encoding of human's path preference θ for computing the posterior in eq. ( ). Devifrom the concept of homotopy classes, we define the preference according to a partitioning of the environment into polytopes, as shown in fig., creating a hyperplane arrangement of the space. We use C g,θ to induce a probability distribution over observations, given by: where γ h is a hyperparameter that designates the rationality coefficient. This model assumes the human will pick the lowest cost action with the highest probability and the likelihood of an action decreases exponentially with the increase in cost. We note that the number of Bayesian updates required at each iteration to update the belief is equal to the cardinality of Ω g × Θ. We assume that for a location st belonging to polytope j, and given goal g and preference pj, the observation ot and any other preference p i,i =j are conditionally independent. We can further reduce the Hrepresentation of a polytopes to include only non-redundant constraints. We define a path preference as the set of preferred transitions over all nodes in the graph. The number of Bayesian updates required to update the belief at every iteration should be m θ × m g. We can notice that by introducing this assumption, we removed the direct relationship between the number of polytopes in the environment and the complexity of the Bayesian update in eq. ( ). In practice, components of θ are not mutually independent. For example, if the human preference at a vertex v 1 is 1, it is unlikely that it will also prefer p v2 = (v 2, v 2 ) (turning back). We can improve our model by assuming a dependent relationship between edges and preferences for edges, which does not significantly increase the complexity. An interesting property of our encoding is that any two paths that belong to any of our two paths is that they belong to each other. We evaluate our model on a simulated navigation task where the robot must reach a goal that is unknown a priori while respecting the path preferences indicated by a human. The robot navigates in a grid world containing obstacles. The transition model is deterministic: the robot selects an adjacent location on the grid to reach at the next time step. We assume that the human selects actions to noisily minimize a cost function C g,θ. We compute costs by running the A path planning algorithm on the environment maps. We impose preference constraints by pruning invalid transitions from the search tree. At each step in time, the robot receives a reward which is a sum of three components: a goal-specific reward, a preference- specific reward or penalty. We also omit the path preference's contribution to the reward R pref. The robot complies with the human input, but does not take an initiative. We designed an arbitration function to decide between our model and the user's recommendation when the robot takes an action. Our metric is similar to the proposed policy to evaluate co-operation between humans and robots. fidence in the robot's prediction for the purpose of arbitration is the entropy of the intention distribution H(g, p i ), where p i denotes the preferred neighbor for the current region. Table I reports the success rates for experiments conducted over six randomly sampled problem instances and 50 runs per instance in Map 1. Results also show that blending the user's input with the robot’s policy (Path Preference + Blend) when the human provides information leads to improved performance. Computation time. More obstacles result in fewer iterations when solving the constrained shortest path problem with A. Adding constraints due to the obstacles and polytopes reduces the size of the A search tree. C. Limitations Simulation environments. The complexity of the Bayesian update should not increase with the number of obstacles orpolytopes. We compute solutions on three maps: a simple 10 × 10 grid world with 8 poly topes, a 10×10 grid world. with 56 poly Topes, and a 20×20 grid. world with 73 polytopers. n our simulations, we hardcoded the preference policy over the maps (e.g. in Map 1, go around the table counter-clockwise). We randomly sampled problem instances (start and goal locations, and goal options) to reduce the bias introduced by these preference choices. The main limitation of our approach is that the size and geometry of each polytope depends strongly on the geometry of the obstacles. Because of this, the robot can make predictions over preferences that are too refined compared with the topology of the environment."
When did the Tevatron Collider Run II start and when is it expected to end?,"\section{INTRODUCTION}
The Tevatron Collider Run II started in March 2002 and is expected
to continue until the end of this decade. The Tevatron and the 
two detectors, CDF and D\O, have been performing  well in 2004,
each experiment is collecting data at the rate 
of $\approx$10 pb$^{-1}$ per week.
The total  luminosity accumulated by August 2004 is $\approx$500 pb$^{-1}$
per detector.
The rich physics program includes the
production and precision measurement of properties of  standard model (SM)
objects, as well as searches for phenomena beyond standard model.
In this brief review we focus on areas of most interest 
to the lattice community. We present
new results on the top quark mass
and their implication for the mass of the SM Higgs boson, 
on searches for the SM Higgs boson, on evidence for the $X(3872)$ state, 
on searches for pentaquarks, and on $b$ hadron properties.
All Run II results presented here are preliminary. 

\section{TOP QUARK MASS}

The experiments CDF and D\O\ published several direct  measurements of
the top quark pole mass, $\ensuremath{M_{\mathrm{top}}}$, 
based on Run I data (1992-1996).
The ``lepton $+$ jets'' channel yields the most precise determination of
$\ensuremath{M_{\mathrm{top}}}$. Recently, the
D\O\ collaboration published a new measurement~\cite{Mtop1-D0-l+j-new},
based on a powerful analysis technique yielding  greatly improved precision.
The differential probability 
that the measured variables in any event correspond to the signal
is calculated as a function of $\ensuremath{M_{\mathrm{top}}}$. 
The maximum in the product of the individual event probabilities 
provides the best estimate of $\ensuremath{M_{\mathrm{top}}}$.
The critical differences from previous analyses 
in the lepton $+$ jets decay channel lie in 
the assignment of more 
weight to events that are well measured or more likely to correspond to  
$t \bar t$ signal, 
and  the handling of the combinations of final-state objects
(lepton, jets, and imbalance in transverse momentum) 
and their identification with
top-quark decay products in an event. 
The new combined value for the top-quark mass from Run I is 
$\ensuremath{M_{\mathrm{top}}}  =  178.0\pm4.3~\ensuremath{\mathrm{ Ge\kern -0.1em V }\kern -0.2em /c^2 }$.

In Run II, both collaborations  have been exploring several different techniques 
for $\ensuremath{M_{\mathrm{top}}}$
measurements. The best single CDF result comes from a dynamic likelihood method
(DLM). The method is similar to
the technique used in Ref.~\cite{Mtop1-D0-l+j-new}.
The result is $\ensuremath{M_{\mathrm{top}}} = 177.8^{+4.5}_{-5.0} (stat) \pm  6.2 (syst) ~\ensuremath{\mathrm{ Ge\kern -0.1em V }\kern -0.2em /c^2 }$.
The joint likelihood of the selected events is shown in Fig. ~\ref{fig:cdf_tml}. 
The Run II goal is a 1\% uncertainty on $\ensuremath{M_{\mathrm{top}}}$.

\section{SEARCH FOR SM HIGGS BOSON}


The constraints on the SM Higgs ($H$)  boson  mass from
published  measurements, updated to include the new D\O\ top mass
measurement~\cite{Mtop1-D0-l+j-new}, are
$M_H = 117 ^{+67}_{-45}~\ensuremath{\mathrm{ Ge\kern -0.1em V }\kern -0.2em /c^2 }$, $M_H < 251~\ensuremath{\mathrm{ Ge\kern -0.1em V }\kern -0.2em /c^2 }$ at 95\% C.L.
The  new most likely  value of $M_H$
is above the experimentally excluded range,
and sufficiently low for $H$ to be observed at the Tevatron.


\begin{figure}[htb]

\vspace*{-1.1cm}
\caption{Distribution of the dijet
invariant mass for $W+2 b$-tagged jets  events,
compared to the expectation (D\O). 
}
\label{fig:d0_wbb_2tag}
\end{figure}



D\O\  has conducted a search for $H$ at $M_H < 140~\ensuremath{\mathrm{ Ge\kern -0.1em V }\kern -0.2em /c^2 }$ 
in the production channel  
$p \bar{p} \rightarrow WH \rightarrow  e \nu b \bar{b}$. 
The experimental signature of  $WH \rightarrow e \nu b \bar{b}$
is a final state with 
one high $p_T$ electron, two  $b$ jets, and
large missing transverse energy  resulting from
the undetected neutrino.
The dominant backgrounds to $WH$ production
are  $W b \bar{b}$, $t \bar{t}$ and single-top production.
The distribution 
of the dijet mass for events with two $b$-tagged jets is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:d0_wbb_2tag}. 
Also shown is the  expected contribution ($0.06$ events)  
from the $b \bar{b}$ decay of a
SM Higgs boson with $M_H =$ 115 $\ensuremath{\mathrm{ Ge\kern -0.1em V }\kern -0.2em /c^2 }$.
No events are observed in the  dijet mass window of 85--135  $\ensuremath{\mathrm{ Ge\kern -0.1em V }\kern -0.2em /c^2 }$.
D\O\ sets a limit on the cross section
for $\sigma( p\bar{p} \rightarrow WH) \times B(H \rightarrow b \bar{b}) $
of 9.0 pb at the 95\% C.L.,  for a 115  $\ensuremath{\mathrm{ Ge\kern -0.1em V }\kern -0.2em /c^2 }$ Higgs boson.
The results for mass points 105, 125, and 135 $\ensuremath{\mathrm{ Ge\kern -0.1em V }\kern -0.2em /c^2 }$
 are 11.0, 9.1 and 12.2 pb,  respectively.

\label{fig:cdf_whww}
\end{figure}


CDF  has done  a similar search, allowing either an  electron or a muon  
in the final state.  Both groups have also searched for $H$ produced in
gluon-gluon fusion, with subsequent decay to a pair of $W$ bosons.
The CDF results for both channels  are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cdf_whww}. 



\section{THE STATE X(3872)}


\begin{figure}[htb]

\includegraphics[height=8.0cm,width=7.5cm]  {X3872cdfPRL1FullM.eps}
\vspace*{-1cm}
\caption{The $X(3872)$ signal (CDF).}
\label{fig:cdf_x}
\end{figure}




 The existence of the $X(3872)$ state discovered by 
the Belle Collaboration~\cite{Belle-X}
 has been confirmed 
 in $p \bar{p}$ collisions by  CDF~\cite{cdf-X} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:cdf_x})
and D\O~\cite{d0-X}.
 It is still unclear whether this particle is a $c\bar{c}$ state,
 or a more complex object.  When the data are separated according to
production and decay variables, D\O\  finds no significant
differences between the $X(3872)$ and
the $c \bar{c}$ state $\psi(2S)$.
CDF has analysed the ``lifetime'' distribution of the $X(3872)$ events in order to
quantify what fraction of this state arises from decay of $B$ hadrons, as opposed to
those produced promptly. The authors find that for the selected samples
28.3$\pm$1.0$(stat)\pm$0.7$(syst)$\% of $\psi(2S)$ candidates are from $b$ decays,
whereas 16.1$\pm$4.9$(stat)\pm$2.0$(syst)$\% of $X$ mesons arise from such decays.





\section{SEARCH FOR PENTAQUARKS}

\caption{Mass of the ($D^{*+}\bar p$) system. The arrow indicates the position of 
the $\Theta_c$ state (CDF).}
\label{fig:pqthetac}
\end{figure}



Following reports of evidence for exotic
baryons containing five quarks (pentaquarks), CDF has analysed 
its data for evidence of the following pentaquarks:
$\Theta^+$ ($uud\bar d \bar s$), doubly strange states 
$\Xi_{3/2}$, charmed states $\Theta_c$, and, most recently, 
a state $(udus\bar b)$, dubbed $R^+_s$, through its weak decay to $(J/\psi, p)$. 
With its excellent particle indentification and mass resolution,
CDF has a unique capability to search for  pentaquark states.
The signals of known states: $\phi$, $\Lambda$,
$\Lambda(1520)$, $K^*$, $\Xi$, 
compare favorably with those provided
by the authors of  the pentaquark evidence.
The group finds no evidence for pentaquark states, see Figs 
~\ref{fig:pqtheta},{\ref{fig:pqxi},\ref{fig:pqthetac}.
This can be interpreted as an indication that the pentaquark production 
in $p \bar p$ collisions is heavily suppressed compared to the conventional
hadron production, or as an evidence against the existence of pentaquarks.

\section{RECENT B PHYSICS RESULTS}


\subsection{Spectroscopy}

CDF has measured the mass of $b$ hadrons in exclusive $J/\psi$ channels.
The measurements of the $B_s$ and $\Lambda_b$ (Fig. \ref{fig:masslb})
masses are the current world's best.\\

$m(B^+)$ = 5279.10$\pm$0.41$(stat)\pm$0.36$(syst)$,

$m(B^0)$ = 5279.63$\pm$0.53$(stat)\pm$0.33$(syst)$,

$m(B_s)$ = 5366.01$\pm$0.73$(stat)\pm$0.33$(syst)$,

$m(\Lambda_b)$ = 5619.7$\pm$1.2$(stat)\pm$1.2$(syst)$ MeV/$c^2$.\\

\caption{The mass spectrum of $\Lambda_b$ candidates (CDF).}
\label{fig:masslb}
\end{figure}


D\O\ reports the first observation of the excited $B$ mesons 
$B_1$ and $B^*_2$ as two separate states in fully reconstructed
decays to $B^{(*)}\pi$. The mass of $B_1$ is measured to be
5724$\pm$4$\pm$7 MeV/c$^2$, and the mass difference $\Delta M$ between
$B^*_2$ and $B_1$ is 23.6$\pm$7.7$\pm$3.9 MeV/c$^2$
(Fig.  \ref{fig:d0_bexc}).

D\O\ observes semileptonic $B$ decays to narrow $D^{**}$ states,
the orbitally excited states  of the $D$ meson
seen as resonances in the $D^{*+}\pi^-$ invariant mass spectrum.
The $D^*$ mesons are reconstructed through the decay sequence 
$D^{*+} \rightarrow D^0\pi^+$, $D^0\rightarrow K^-\pi^+$.
The invariant mass  of oppositely charged $(D^*,\pi)$ pairs
is shown in Fig.  \ref{fig:d0_dstst}.
The mass peak between 2.4 and 2.5 GeV/$c^2$ can be interpreted as two merged 
narrow $D^{**}$ states, $D^0_1(2420)$ and $D^0_2(2460)$.
The combined branching fraction is 
$ {\cal B}(B\rightarrow D^0_1,D^0_2)\cdot {\cal B}(D^0_1,D^0_2\rightarrow D^{*+}\pi^-)=(0.280\pm0.021(stat)\pm0.088(syst)$\%. The systematic error includes the unknown phase between the
two resonances. Work is in progress on extracting the two Breit-Wigner
amplitudes.

\subsection{Lifetimes}


CDF and D\O\ have measured  lifetimes of $b$ hadrons through the exclusively
reconstructed decays $B^+ \rightarrow J/\psi K^+$, $B^0 \rightarrow J/\psi K^{*0}$,
$B_s \rightarrow J/\psi \phi$, 
and $\Lambda_b \rightarrow J/\psi \Lambda$
(Fig. \ref{fig:d0_lbctau}).
The latest results are:  \\



 $\tau(B^+)$=1.65 $\pm$ 0.08 $^{+0.096}_{-0.123}$  ps ~(D\O\ 2003),

 $\tau(B^+)$=1.662 $\pm$ 0.033  $\pm$ 0.008  ps ~(CDF),

 $\tau(B^0_d)$=1.473  $^{+0.052}_{-0.050}$ $\pm$ 0.023    ps ~(D\O).

 $\tau(B^0_d)$=1.539 $\pm$ 0.051  $\pm$ 0.008  ps ~(CDF),

 $\tau(B^0_s)$=1.444   $^{+0.098}_{-0.090}$ $\pm$ 0.020   ps ~(D\O),

 $\tau(B^0_s)$=1.369 $\pm$ 0.100 $\pm$ $^{+0.008}_{0.010}$  ps ~(CDF),


 $\tau(\Lambda_b)$=1.221 $^{+0.217}_{-0.179}$ $\pm$ 0.043  ps ~(D\O),


 $\tau(\Lambda_b)$=1.25 $\pm$ 0.26 $\pm$ 0.10  ps ~(CDF 2003).\\



The measured lifetimes correspond to the following lifetime ratios:\\

$\tau(B^+)/\tau(B^0_d)$   =  1.080$\pm$0.042     ~(CDF),
 
$\tau(B^0_s)/\tau(B^0_d)$ =  0.890$\pm$0.072    ~(CDF),

$\tau(B^0_s)/\tau(B^0_d)$ = 0.980$ ^{+0.075}_{-0.070}   \pm$0.003    ~(D\O),

$\tau(\Lambda_b)/\tau(B^0_d)$ =  0.874$ ^{+0.169}_{-0.142}   \pm$0.028    ~(D\O).\\

\label{fig:d0_lbctau}
\end{figure}


The $B_s$ lifetime measurements listed above are results of
a single-lifetime fit to data, integrated over the decay angles.
Because  of the presence of  final
states  common to ${B_s^0}$\ and its charge conjugate ${\overline{B}_s^0}$,
the two meson states   are expected
to mix in such a way that the two CP  eigenstates may have a relatively
large lifetime difference.
It is possible to
separate the two CP components of ${B_s^0 \rightarrow J/\psi \phi}$\ and thus to measure the
lifetime difference by studying the time evolution of the
polarization states of the vector mesons in the final state.
CDF has carried out a combined analysis of $B_s$ lifetimes 
and polarization amplitudes. The results for the lifetimes of the
low mass (CP even) and high mass (CP odd) eigenstates, and the relative 
width difference are:\\

 $\tau_L = 1.05 ^{+0.16}_{-0.13} \pm 0.02$ ~ps,
 
 $\tau_H = 2.07 ^{+0.58}_{-0.46} \pm 0.03$ ~ps,

 $\Delta \Gamma /\overline \Gamma   = 0.65 ^{+0.25}_{-0.33} \pm 0.01$.\\

Figure \ref{fig:cdf_dg} shows  the scan of the likelihood function 
for $\Delta \Gamma /\overline \Gamma$.
Pseudoexperiments tossed with $\Delta \Gamma /\overline \Gamma =0$
yield the betting odds for observing the above results at
1/315. For $\Delta \Gamma /\overline \Gamma = 0.12$ (SM prediction,
which has recently been updated to 0.14$\pm$0.05~\cite{dg_un}) the betting odds are
1/84.

D\O\ has used a novel technique to  measure the lifetime ratio
of the charged and neutral $B$ mesons, exploiting the large
semileptonic sample. $B$ hadrons were reconstructed in the channels
$B\rightarrow \mu^+ \nu D^*(2010)^-X$, which are dominated by $B^0$ decays, 
and  $B\rightarrow \mu^+ \nu D^0X$, which are dominated by $B^+$ decays.
The lifetime ratio was
obtained from the variation of the ratio of the number of events in these two
processes at different decay lengths.
The result is \\

\subsection{Towards $B_s$ mixing}

Measurement of the $B_s$ oscillation frequency via ${B_s^0}$ -${\overline{B}_s^0}$ ~mixing
will provide an important constraint on the CKM matrix. The oscillation
frequency is proportional to the mass difference between the mass eigenstates,
$\Delta m_s$, and is related to the CKM matrix through 
$\Delta m_s \propto |V_{tb}V_{ts}|$. When combined with the
$B_d$ mass difference, $\Delta m_d$ it helps in extraction of $|V_{td}|$,
and thereby the CP violating phase. 

As a benchmark for future $B_s$ oscillation measurement, both groups
study  $B_d$ mixing, gaining an understanding of the different components
of a $B$ mixing analysis (sample composition, flavor tagging, vertexing,
asymmetry fitting). For a sample of partially reconstructed decays
$B\rightarrow D^*(2010)^+\mu^-X$, D\O\ obtains 
$\Delta m_d = 0.506 \pm 0.055 (stat) \pm  0.049 (syst))$ ps$^{-1}$ and
$\Delta m_d = 0.488 \pm 0.066 (stat) \pm  0.044 (syst))$ ps$^{-1}$
when employing  opposite side muon tagging and the same side tagging,
respectively.

The CDF result for semileptonic channels is
$\Delta m_d = 0.536 \pm 0.037 (stat) \pm  0.009 (s.c.) \pm 0.015 (syst)$ ps$^{-1}$.
CDF also reports a result on $B$ oscillations using fully reconstructed
decays:
$\Delta m_d = 0.526 \pm 0.056 (stat) \pm  0.005 (syst))$ ps$^{-1}$.

Reconstructing $B_s$ decays into different final states is another
important
 step in the ${B_s^0}$ -${\overline{B}_s^0}$ ~mixing analysis.
Thanks to the  large muon and tracking coverage,   D\O\ is accumulating
a  high statistics sample of semileptonic $B_s$ decays.
D\O\ reconstructs the $B_s \rightarrow D^+_s \mu^- X$ decays, with
$D^+_s \rightarrow \phi \pi^+ $ and
$D^+_s \rightarrow K^* K^+ $,
at a rate of $\approx$ 40(25) events per pb$^{-1}$,  respectively.
Figure \ref{fig:d0_bsdsphipi} shows the mass distribution of the
$D^+_s \rightarrow \phi \pi$ candidates.

CDF has clean signals for fully hadronic, flavor-specific  $B_s$ decays,
providing the best sensitivity to $B_s$ oscillations at high
$\Delta m_s$. Figure \ref{fig:cdf_bsdsphipi} shows the signal for
the best channel, $B_s \rightarrow D_s \pi$, $D_s \rightarrow \phi \pi$.

\subsection{Rare decays}

The purely leptonic decays $B_{d,s}^0 \rightarrow \mu^+
\mu^-$ are flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes.
In the standard model, these decays are forbidden at the tree level and
proceed at a very low rate through higher-order diagrams.
The latest SM prediction~\cite{sm_ref3}
is ${\cal B}(B^0_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-)=(3.42\pm 0.54)\times
10^{-9}$, where the error is dominated by non-perturbative uncertainties. The
leptonic branching fraction of the $B_d^0$ decay is suppressed by CKM matrix elements $|V_{td}/V_{ts}|^2$
leading to a predicted SM branching fraction of $(1.00\pm0.14)\times 10^{-10}$.
The best published experimental bound (Fig.~\ref{fig:cdf_bsmumu})
 for the branching fraction
of $B^0_s$ $(B^0_d)$ is presently
${\cal B}(B^0_s \, (B^0_d) \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-)<7.5\times 10^{-7}\, 
(1.9\times 10^{-7})$ at the 95\% C.L.~\cite{cdfII}.
The decay amplitude of $B^0_{d,s} \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$ can be
significantly enhanced in some extensions of the SM.

Assuming no contributions 
from the decay $B^0_d\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ in the signal region,
D\O\  finds the conservative upper limit on the branching fraction 
to be ${\cal B}(B^0_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-) \leq 4.6\times 10^{-7}$ 
at the 95\% C.L. (Fig.~\ref{fig:d0_bsmumu}).

We present new results on the top quark mass and their implication for the mass of the SM Higgs boson. We also look at evidence for the $X(3872)$ state, on searches for pentaquarks, and on $b$ hadron properties. All Run II results presented here are preliminary and are based on data from the CDF and D\O detectors. The joint likelihood of the selected events is shown in Fig. 2 in the figure below.

No events are observed in the dijet mass window of 85--135. It is still unclear whether this state is a more complex object. The authors find that for the samples selected for the selected samples that were promptly produced, no significant differences between those produced and those that were not. The existence of the state has been confirmed in $p \bar{p}$ collisions by  CDF~\cite{cdf-X} (see Fig. 1). The authors have also searched for $H$ produced in gluon-gluon fusion, with subsequent decay to a pair of $W$ bosons. The results for mass points 105, 125, and 135 are 11.0, 9.1 and 12.2 pb,  respectively, for a 115  $\ensuremath{\mathrm{ Ge\kern -0.1em V }/c^2 }$ Higgs boson with $M_H =$ 115 $W b \bar {b}$ and single top production. ique capability to search for  pentaquark states. The group finds no evidence for pentaquarks. The mass of $b$ hadrons in exclusive $J/\psi$ channels is the current world's best. This can be interpreted as an indication that the pentquark production in $p \bar p$ collisions is heavily suppressed compared to the conventionalhadron production, or as an evidence against the existence of pentquarks. Work is in progress on extracting the two resonances in the Breitenbach-Wigner-Wagner model. Theoretically, this could lead to the discovery of a new type of superconducting superconductor, known as a ‘superconductor’ or ‘Superconducting Superconductor Superconductor (SSTS)’. SSTS is a type of synchrotron that has been used to study superconductors in the past. The SSTs have been used in a number of other fields, such as superconductivity and magnetohydrodynamics, as well as in the study of supernovae in the 1970s and 1980s. The study of the SST’s in the 1980s and 1990s was the first to show that they could be used as a source of information about the state of the universe. The $B_s$ lifetime measurements listed above are results of a single-lifetime fit to data, integrated over the decay angles. The results for the lifetimes of the low mass (CP even) and high mass ( CP odd) eigenstates, and the relative  grotesquewidth difference are:. The betting odds for observing the above results at the time of this article are at 1/315. For the likelihood function, the odds are 0.12/0.14$ (SM prediction, which has recently been updated to 0.14/1.05/cite), and 0.01/1/315 (the odds of observing the results at 0.04/1, which is the same as the SM prediction, but the odds of seeing the results are lower). The odds of spotting the results were 0.02/1 (the SM prediction) for the $Lambda_b candidates. The odds for spotting the candidates for the CP odd eigenstate is 0.03/1-0.05 (this has been updated from 0.08/0, which was previously 0.07/1), and the odds for detecting the CP eveneigenstate are 0,0.01/. (this was originally 0.06/1). CDF has clean signals for fully hadronic, flavor-specific $B_s$ decays. The purely leptonic decays $B_{d,s]^0 are flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes. These decays are forbidden at the tree level and proceed at a very low rate through higher-order diagrams. The latest SM prediction is dominated by non-perturbative uncertainties. The experimental bound for the branching fraction at the 95% Cdf level is presently at 95%. The amplitude of the decay $0_0_d$ is presently 1.7 times the amplitude of $0.1_d#d$ (CDF) This is the best prediction for the best branching fraction for the $B-d$ decay at the CDF level. The prediction is based on the fact that $B$ oscillations are not affected by CKM matrix elements in the Cdf-CDF model. The predicted SM branching fraction is 1.6 times higher than the current SM prediction for $B.1#d. This means that the prediction is more likely to be correct than the previous SM prediction of 1.5 times the magnitude of the B-d-d decay.

How many brother does Njoroge have?,"Weep Not, Child is a 1964 novel by Kenyan author Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o. It was his first novel, published in 1964 under the name James Ngugi. It was among the African Writers Series. It was the first English language|English novel to be published by an East African. Thiong'o's works deal with the relationship between Africans and white settlers in colonial Kenya, and are heavily critical of colonial rule. Specifically, Weep Not, Child deals with the Mau Mau Uprising, and ""the bewildering dispossession of an entire people from their ancestral land."" Ngũgĩ wrote the novel while he was a student at Makerere University.

The book is divided into two parts and eighteen chapters. Part one deals mostly with the education of Njoroge, while part two deals with the rising Mau Mau movement.

Plot summary

Njoroge, a little boy, is urged to attend school by his mother. He is the first one of his family able to go to school. His family lives on the land of Jacobo, an African made rich by his dealings with white settlers, namely Mr. Howlands, the most powerful land owner in the area. Njoroge's brother Kamau works as an apprentice to a carpenter, while Boro, the eldest living son, is troubled by his experiences while in forced service during World War II, including witnessing the death of his elder brother. Ngotho, Njoroge's father and a respected man in the surrounding area, tends Mr. Howlands' crops, but is motivated by his passion to preserve his ancestral land, rather than for any compensation or loyalty.

One day, black workers call for a strike to obtain higher wages. Ngotho is ambivalent about participating in the strike because he fears he will lose his job. However, he decides to go to the gathering, even though his two wives do not agree. At the demonstration, there are calls for higher wages. Suddenly, the white police inspector brings Jacobo to the gathering to pacify the native people. Jacobo tries to put an end to the strike. Ngotho attacks Jacobo, and the result is a riot where two people are killed. Jacobo survives and swears revenge. Ngotho loses his job and Njoroge’s family is forced to move. Njoroge’s brothers fund his education and seem to lose respect for their father.

Mwihaki, Jacobo's daughter and Njoroge's best friend, enters a girls' only boarding school, leaving Njoroge relatively alone. He reflects upon her leaving, and realizes that he was embarrassed by his father's actions towards Jacobo. For this reason, Njoroge is not upset by her exit and their separation. Njoroge switches to another school.

For a time, everyone's attention is focused on the upcoming trial of Jomo Kenyatta – a revered leader of the movement. Many blacks think that he is going to bring forth Kenya’s independence. But Jomo loses the trial and is imprisoned. This results in further protests and greater suppression of the black population.

Jacobo and a white landowner, Mr. Howlands, fight against the rising activities of the Mau Mau, an organization striving for Kenyan economic, political, and cultural independence. Jacobo accuses Ngotho of being the leader of the Mau Mau and tries to imprison the whole family. Meanwhile, the situation in the country is deteriorating. Six black men are taken out of their houses and executed in the woods.

One day Njoroge meets Mwihaki again, who has returned from boarding school. Although Njoroge had planned to avoid her due to the conflict between their fathers, their friendship is unaffected. Njoroge passes an important exam that allows him to advance to High School. His village is proud of him, and collects money to pay Njoroge's High School tuition.

Several months later, Jacobo is murdered in his office by a member of the Mau Mau. Mr. Howlands has Njoroge removed from school for questioning. Both father and son are brutally beaten before release and Ngotho is left barely alive. Although there doesn't seem to be a connection between Njoroge's family and the murder, it is eventually revealed that Njoroge's brothers are behind the assassination, and that Boro is the real leader of the Mau Mau. Ngotho soon dies from his injuries and Njoroge finds out that his father was protecting his brothers. Kamau has been imprisoned for life. Only Njoroge and his two mothers remain free, and Njoroge is left as the sole provider of his two mothers. Njoroge fears that he cannot make ends meet; he gives up hope of continuing in school and loses faith in God.

Njoroge asks Mwihaki's for support, but she is angry because of her father’s death. When he finally pledges his love to her, she refuses to leave with him, realizing her obligation to Kenya and her mother. Njoroge decides to leave town and makes an attempt at suicide; however, he fails when his mothers find him before he is able to hang himself. The novel closes with Njoroge feeling hopeless, and ashamed of cowardice.

Characters in Weep Not, Child
 Njoroge: the main character of the book whose main goal throughout the book is to become as educated as possible.
 Ngotho: Njoroge's father. He works for Mr.Howlands and is respected by him until he attacks Jacobo at a workers strike. He is fired and the family is forced to move to another section of the country. Over the course of the book his position as the central power of the family weakened, to the point where his self-realization that he has spent his whole life waiting for the prophecy (that proclaims the blacks will be returned their land) to come true rather than fighting for Kenyan independence, leads to his depression.
 Nyokabi and Njeri: the two wives of Ngotho. Njeri is Ngotho's first wife, and mother of Boro, Kamau, and Kori. Nyokabi is his second wife, and the mother of Njoroge and Mwangi.
 Njoroge has four brothers: Boro, Kamau, Kori and Mwangi (who is Njoroge's only full brother, who died in World War II).
 Boro: Son of Njeri who fights for the Allies in World War II. Upon returning his anger against the colonial government is compounded by their confiscation of the his land. Boro's anger and position as eldest son leads him to question and ridicule Ngotho, which eventually defeats their father's will (upon realizing his life was wasted waiting and not acting). It is eventually revealed that Boro is the leader of the Mau Mau (earlier alluded to as ""entering politics"") and murders Mr.Howlands. He is caught by police immediately after and is scheduled to be executed by the book's end. It is highly likely that it is also Boro who kills Jacobo.
 Mwihaki: Njoroge's best friend (and later develops into his love interest). Daughter of Jacobo. When it is revealed that his family killed Jacobo (most likely Boro), Mwihaki distances herself from Njoroge, asking for time to mourn her father and care for her mother.
 Jacobo: Mwihaki's father and an important landowner. Chief of the village.
 Mr. Howlands: A white settler who emigrated to colonial Kenya and now owns a farm made up of land that originally belonged to Ngotho's ancestors. Has three children: Peter who died in World War II before the book's beginning, a daughter who becomes a missionary, and Stephen who met Njoroge while the two were in high school.

Themes and motifs
Weep Not, Child integrates Gikuyu mythology and the ideology of nationalism that serves as catalyst for much of the novel's action. The novel explores the negative aspects of colonial rule over Kenya. Njoroge's aspiration to attend university is frustrated by both the violence of the Mau Mau rebels and the violent response of the colonial government. This disappointment leads to his alienation from his family and ultimately his suicide attempt.

The novel also ponders the role of saviours and salvation. The author notes in his The River Between: ""Salvation shall come from the hills. From the blood that flows in me, I say from the same tree, a son shall rise. And his duty shall be to lead and save the people."" Jomo Kenyatta, the first prime minister of Kenya, is immortalised in Weep Not, Child. The author says, ""Jomo had been his (Ngotho's) hope. Ngotho had come to think that it was Jomo who would drive away the white man. To him, Jomo stood for custom and traditions purified by grace of learning and much travel."" Njoroge comes to view Jomo as a messiah who will win the struggle against the colonial government.",['Four.'],1414,multifieldqa_en,en,,69e69439e349a539ca4cff96ae35aa8499ca61886801d488," Weep Not, Child is a 1964 novel by Kenyan author Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o.

What are the stability conditions for a solution of $-\Delta u = f(u)$?,"\section{Introduction and main results}


In this note we are interested in the existence versus non-existence of stable sub- and super-solutions of equations of the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
-div( \omega_1(x) \nabla u ) = \omega_2(x) f(u) \qquad \mbox{in $ {\mathbb{R}}^N$,}
\end{equation} where $f(u)$ is one of the following non-linearities: $e^u$,  $ u^p$ where $ p>1$ and $ -u^{-p}$ where $ p>0$.  We assume that $ \omega_1(x)$ and $ \omega_2(x)$, which we call \emph{weights},  are smooth positive functions (we allow $ \omega_2$ to be zero at say a point) and which satisfy various growth conditions at $ \infty$.    Recall that we say that a solution $ u $ of $ -\Delta u = f(u)$ in $ {\mathbb{R}}^N$ is stable provided
\[ \int f'(u) \psi^2 \le \int | \nabla \psi|^2, \qquad \forall \psi \in C_c^2,\] where $ C_c^2$ is the set of $ C^2$ functions defined on $ {\mathbb{R}}^N$ with compact support.  Note that the stability of $u$ is just saying that the second variation at $u$ of the energy associated with the equation is non-negative.     In our setting this becomes:  We say a $C^2$ sub/super-solution $u$ of (\ref{eq1}) is \emph{stable} provided
\begin{equation} \label{stable}
\int \omega_2 f'(u) \psi^2 \le \int \omega_1 | \nabla \psi|^2 \qquad \forall \psi \in C_c^2.
\end{equation}
One should note that (\ref{eq1}) can be re-written as
\begin{equation*}
- \Delta u  + \nabla \gamma(x) \cdot \nabla u ={ \omega_2}/{\omega_1}\ f(u) \qquad \text{ in $ \mathbb{R}^N$},
\end{equation*}
where
$\gamma = - \log( \omega_1)$ and on occasion we shall take this point of view.


\begin{remark} \label{triv} Note that  if $ \omega_1$ has enough integrability then it is immediate that if $u$ is a stable solution  of (\ref{eq1}) we have $ \int \omega_2 f'(u) =0 $  (provided $f$ is increasing).   To see this let $ 0 \le \psi \le 1$ be supported in a ball of radius $2R$ centered at the origin ($B_{2R}$) with $ \psi =1$ on $ B_R$ and such that $  | \nabla \psi | \le \frac{C}{R}$ where $ C>0$ is independent of $ R$.   Putting this $ \psi$ into $ (\ref{stable})$ one obtains
\[ \int_{B_R} \omega_2 f'(u) \le \frac{C}{R^2} \int_{R < |x| <2R} \omega_1,\] and so if the right hand side goes to zero as $ R \rightarrow \infty$ we have the desired result.

\end{remark}





The existence versus non-existence of stable solutions of  $ -\Delta u =  f(u)$ in $ {\mathbb{R}}^N$ or $ -\Delta u = g(x) f(u)$ in $ {\mathbb{R}}^N$ is now quite well understood, see  \cite{dancer1, farina1, egg, zz, f2, f3, wei, ces, e1, e2}.  We remark that some of these results are examining the case where $ \Delta $ is replaced with $ \Delta_p$ (the $p$-Laplacian) and also in many cases the authors are interested in finite Morse index solutions or solutions which are stable outside a compact set.
  Much of the interest in these Liouville type theorems  stems from the fact that the non-existence of a stable solution is related to the existence of a priori estimates for stable solutions of a related equation on a bounded domain.




       In \cite{Ni}  equations similar to  $ -\Delta u = |x|^\alpha u^p$  where examined on the unit ball in $ {\mathbb{R}}^N$ with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions.  There it was shown that for $ \alpha >0$ that  one can obtain positive solutions for $ p $ supercritical with respect to Sobolev embedding and so one can view that the term $ |x|^\alpha$ is restoring some compactness.      A similar feature happens for equations of the form
\[ -\Delta u = |x|^\alpha f(u) \qquad \mbox{in $ {\mathbb{R}}^N$};\]    the value of $ \alpha$ can vastly alter the existence versus non-existence of a stable solution,  see \cite{e1, ces, e2, zz, egg}.

We now come to our main results and for this we need to define a few quantities:

\begin{eqnarray*}
I_G&:=& R^{-4t-2} \int_{ R < |x|<2R} \frac{ \omega_1^{2t+1}}{\omega_2^{2t}}dx , \\
 J_G&:=& R^{-2t-1} \int_{R < |x| <2R} \frac{| \nabla \omega_1|^{2t+1} }{\omega_2^{2t}} dx  ,\\I_L&:=& R^\frac{-2(2t+p-1)}{p-1}  \int_{R<|x|<2R }{ \left(   \frac{w_1^{p+2t-1}}{w_2^{2t}}    \right)^{\frac{1}{p-1} }  }  dx,\\ J_L&:= &R^{-\frac{p+2t-1}{p-1} }  \int_{R<|x|<2R }{ \left(   \frac{|\nabla w_1|^{p+2t-1}}{w_2^{2t}}     \right)^{\frac{1}{p-1} }  }  dx,\\
I_M  &:=&   R^{-2\frac{p+2t+1}{p+1} }  \int_{R<|x|<2R }{ \left(   \frac{w_1^{p+2t+1}}{w_2^{2t}}    \right)^{\frac{1}{p+1} }  } \ dx, \\
J_M  &:= &  R^{-\frac{p+2t+1}{p+1} }  \int_{R<|x|<2R }{ \left(   \frac{|\nabla w_1|^{p+2t+1}}{w_2^{2t}}     \right)^{\frac{1}{p+1} }  }  dx.
\end{eqnarray*}


The three equations we examine are
\[ -div( \omega_1 \nabla u ) = \omega_2 e^u \qquad \mbox{ in $ {\mathbb{R}}^N$ } \quad  (G), \]
\[  -div( \omega_1 \nabla u ) = \omega_2 u^p \qquad \mbox{ in $ {\mathbb{R}}^N$ } \quad  (L), \]
\[ -div( \omega_1 \nabla u ) = - \omega_2 u^{-p} \qquad \mbox{ in $ {\mathbb{R}}^N$ } \quad  (M),\]  and where we restrict $(L)$ to the case $ p>1$ and $(M)$ to $ p>0$.    By solution we always mean a $C^2$ solution.   We now come to our main results in terms of abstract $ \omega_1 $ and $ \omega_2$.    We remark that our approach to non-existence of stable solutions is the approach due to Farina, see \cite{f2,f3,farina1}.

\begin{thm} \label{main_non_exist} \begin{enumerate}


\item   There is no  stable sub-solution of $(G)$ if $ I_G, J_G \rightarrow 0$ as $ R \rightarrow \infty$   for some   $0<t<2$.
 \item    There is no positive   stable sub-solution (super-solution) of $(L)$  if  $ I_L,J_L \rightarrow 0$ as $ R \rightarrow \infty$   for some   $p- \sqrt{p(p-1)}   < t<p+\sqrt{p(p-1)} $  ($0<t<\frac{1}{2}$).
\item   There is no positive   stable super-solution of (M) if  $ I_M,J_M \rightarrow 0$ as $ R \rightarrow \infty$  for some $0<t<p+\sqrt{p(p+1)}$.

\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}     If we assume that $ \omega_1$ has some monotonicity we can do  better.   We will assume that the monotonicity conditions is satisfied for big $x$  but really all ones needs is for it to be satisfied on a suitable sequence of annuli.

\begin{thm} \label{mono}  \begin{enumerate} \item There is no  stable sub-solution of $(G)$ with $  \nabla \omega_1(x) \cdot  x \le 0$ for big $x$ if  $ I_G \rightarrow 0$ as $ R \rightarrow \infty$   for some   $0<t<2$.

\item There is no positive  stable sub-solution of  $(L)$ provided  $  I_L \rightarrow 0$ as $ R \rightarrow \infty$ for either:
\begin{itemize}
\item  some $  1 \le t < p + \sqrt{p(p-1)}$ and $  \nabla \omega_1(x) \cdot x \le 0$ for big $x$,  or  \\

\item some $ p - \sqrt{p(p-1)} < t \le 1$ and $ \nabla \omega_1(x) \cdot x \ge 0$ for big $ x$.
\end{itemize}
 There is no positive super-solution of $(L)$ provided $ I_L \rightarrow 0$ as $ R \rightarrow \infty$ for some $ 0 < t < \frac{1}{2}$ and $ \nabla \omega_1(x) \cdot x \le 0$ for big $x$.



\item  There is no positive stable super-solution of $(M)$ provided  $ I_M \rightarrow 0$ as $ R \rightarrow \infty$  for some  $0<t<p+\sqrt{p(p+1)}$.

\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}


\begin{cor}  \label{thing}  Suppose $ \omega_1 \le C  \omega_2$  for big $ x$, $ \omega_2 \in L^\infty$,  $ \nabla \omega_1(x) \cdot  x \le 0$ for big $ x$.
\begin{enumerate} \item There is no stable sub-solution of $(G)$ if $ N \le 9$.

\item  There is no positive stable sub-solution of $(L)$ if  $$N<2+\frac{4}{p-1} \left( p+\sqrt{p(p-1)}  \right).$$

\item  There is no positive stable super-solution of $(M)$ if $$N<2+\frac{4}{p+1} \left( p+\sqrt{p(p+1)}  \right).$$

\end{enumerate}

\end{cor}


If one takes $ \omega_1=\omega_2=1$ in the above corollary, the results obtained for $(G)$ and  $(L)$,  and for some values of $p$ in $(M)$, are optimal, see \cite{f2,f3,zz}.





We now drop all monotonicity conditions on $ \omega_1$.

\begin{cor} \label{po} Suppose  $ \omega_1 \le C \omega_2$ for big $x$, $ \omega_2 \in L^\infty$, $ | \nabla \omega_1| \le C \omega_2$ for big $x$.
\begin{enumerate} \item  There is no stable sub-solution of $(G)$ if $ N \le 4$.

\item  There is no positive stable sub-solution of $(L)$ if $$N<1+\frac{2}{p-1} \left( p+\sqrt{p(p-1)}  \right).$$

\item There is no positive super-solution of $(M)$ if $$N<1+\frac{2}{p+1} \left( p+\sqrt{p(p+1)}  \right).$$

\end{enumerate}

\end{cor}

Some of the conditions on $ \omega_i$ in Corollary \ref{po} seem somewhat artificial.  If we shift over to the advection equation (and we take $ \omega_1=\omega_2$  for simplicity)
\[ -\Delta u + \nabla \gamma \cdot \nabla u = f(u), \] the conditions on $ \gamma$ become: $ \gamma$ is bounded from below and has a bounded gradient.



In what follows we examine the case where $ \omega_1(x) = (|x|^2 +1)^\frac{\alpha}{2}$ and $ \omega_2(x)= g(x) (|x|^2 +1)^\frac{\beta}{2}$,  where $ g(x) $ is positive except at say a point, smooth and where $ \lim_{|x| \rightarrow \infty} g(x) = C \in (0,\infty)$.     For this class of weights we can essentially obtain optimal results.


\begin{thm} \label{alpha_beta}   Take $ \omega_1 $ and $ \omega_2$ as above.
\begin{enumerate}

\item If $ N+ \alpha - 2 <0$ then there is no stable sub-solution for $(G)$, $(L)$ (here we require it to be positive) and in the case of $(M)$ there is no positive  stable  super-solution. This case is the trivial case, see Remark \ref{triv}.  \\



\textbf{Assumption:} For the remaining cases we assume that $ N + \alpha -2 > 0$.

  \item If  $N+\alpha-2<4(\beta-\alpha+2)$ then there is no  stable sub-solution for $ (G)$.

\item If $N+\alpha-2<\frac{ 2(\beta-\alpha+2)   }{p-1} \left( p+\sqrt{p(p-1)}  \right)$ then there is  no positive stable sub-solution of $(L)$.

\item If $N+\alpha-2<\frac{2(\beta-\alpha+2)   }{p+1} \left( p+\sqrt{p(p+1)}  \right)$ then there is no positive stable super-solution of $(M)$.

\item Further more 2,3,4 are optimal in the sense if $ N + \alpha -2 > 0$ and the remaining inequality is not satisfied (and in addition we assume we don't have equality in the inequality) then we can find a suitable function $ g(x)$ which satisfies the above properties and a stable sub/super-solution $u$ for the appropriate equation.

\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}

\begin{remark}  Many of the above results can be extended to the case of equality in either the $ N + \alpha - 2 \ge 0$ and also the other inequality which depends on the equation we are  examining.  We omit the details because one cannot prove the results in a unified way.

\end{remark}






















In showing that an explicit solution is stable we will need the   weighted Hardy inequality given in \cite{craig}.
\begin{lemma} \label{Har}
Suppose $ E>0$ is a smooth function.  Then one has
\[ (\tau-\frac{1}{2})^2 \int E^{2\tau-2} | \nabla E|^2 \phi^2 + (\frac{1}{2}-\tau) \int (-\Delta E) E^{2\tau-1} \phi^2 \le \int E^{2\tau} | \nabla \phi|^2,\] for all $ \phi \in C_c^\infty({\mathbb{R}}^N)$ and $ \tau \in {\mathbb{R}}$.
\end{lemma}  By picking an appropriate function $E$ this gives,

\begin{cor} \label{Hardy}
For all $ \phi \in C_c^\infty$ and $ t , \alpha \in {\mathbb{R}}$. We have
  \begin{eqnarray*}
\int (1+|x|^2)^\frac{\alpha}{2} |\nabla\phi|^2 &\ge& (t+\frac{\alpha}{2})^2 \int |x|^2 (1+|x|^2)^{-2+\frac{\alpha}{2}}\phi^2\\
&&+(t+\frac{\alpha}{2})\int  (N-2(t+1)   \frac{|x|^2}{1+|x|^2}) (1+|x|^2)^{-1+\frac{\alpha} {2}} \phi^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
 \end{cor}























\section{Proof of main results}

\textbf{ Proof of Theorem \ref{main_non_exist}.}   (1). Suppose $ u$ is a stable sub-solution of $(G)$ with $ I_G,J_G \rightarrow 0$ as $ R \rightarrow \infty$ and  let $ 0 \le \phi \le 1$ denote a smooth compactly supported function.  Put $ \psi:= e^{tu} \phi$ into (\ref{stable}), where $ 0 <t<2$, to arrive at
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int \omega_2 e^{(2t+1)u} \phi^2 &\le & t^2 \int \omega_1 e^{2tu} | \nabla u|^2 \phi^2 \\
&& +\int \omega_1 e^{2tu}|\nabla \phi|^2 + 2 t \int \omega_1 e^{2tu} \phi \nabla u \cdot \nabla \phi.
\end{eqnarray*}  Now multiply $(G)$ by $ e^{2tu} \phi^2$ and integrate by parts to arrive at
\[ 2t \int \omega_1 e^{2tu} | \nabla u|^2 \phi^2 \le \int \omega_2 e^{(2t+1) u} \phi^2 - 2 \int \omega_1 e^{2tu} \phi \nabla u \cdot \nabla \phi,\]
and now if one equates like terms they arrive at
\begin{eqnarray} \label{start}
\frac{(2-t)}{2} \int \omega_2 e^{(2t+1) u} \phi^2  & \le & \int \omega_1 e^{2tu} \left( | \nabla \phi |^2 - \frac{ \Delta \phi}{2} \right) dx \nonumber \\
&& - \frac{1}{2} \int e^{2tu} \phi \nabla \omega_1 \cdot \nabla \phi.
\end{eqnarray}   Now substitute $ \phi^m$ into this inequality for $ \phi$ where $ m $ is a big integer to obtain
\begin{eqnarray} \label{start_1}
\frac{(2-t)}{2} \int \omega_2 e^{(2t+1) u} \phi^{2m}  & \le & C_m \int \omega_1 e^{2tu} \phi^{2m-2}  \left( | \nabla \phi |^2 + \phi |\Delta \phi|  \right) dx \nonumber \\
&& - D_m \int e^{2tu} \phi^{2m-1} \nabla \omega_1 \cdot \nabla \phi
\end{eqnarray} where $ C_m$ and $ D_m$ are positive constants just depending on $m$.   We now estimate the  terms on the right but we mention that when ones assume the appropriate monotonicity on $ \omega_1$ it is the last integral on the right which one is able to drop.

\begin{eqnarray*}
\int \omega_1 e^{2tu} \phi^{2m-2} | \nabla \phi|^2 & = & \int \omega_2^\frac{2t}{2t+1} e^{2tu} \phi^{2m-2}  \frac{ \omega_1 }{\omega_2^\frac{2t}{2t+1}} | \nabla \phi|^2  \\
& \le &  \left( \int \omega_2 e^{(2t+1) u} \phi^{(2m-2) \frac{(2t+1)}{2t}} dx \right)^\frac{2t}{2t+1}\\ &&\left( \int \frac{ \omega_1 ^{2t+1}}{\omega_2^{2t}} | \nabla \phi |^{2(2t+1)} \right)^\frac{1}{2t+1}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Now, for fixed $ 0 <t<2$ we can take $ m $ big enough so $ (2m-2) \frac{(2t+1)}{2t} \ge 2m $ and since $ 0 \le \phi \le 1$ this allows us to replace the power on $ \phi$ in the first term on the right with $2m$   and hence we obtain
 \begin{equation} \label{three}
 \int \omega_1 e^{2tu} \phi^{2m-2} | \nabla \phi|^2  \le \left( \int \omega_2 e^{(2t+1) u} \phi^{2m} dx \right)^\frac{2t}{2t+1} \left( \int \frac{ \omega_1 ^{2t+1}}{\omega_2^{2t}} | \nabla \phi |^{2(2t+1)} \right)^\frac{1}{2t+1}.
 \end{equation}    We now take the test functions $ \phi$ to be such that $ 0 \le  \phi \le 1$ with $ \phi $ supported in the ball $ B_{2R}$ with $ \phi = 1 $ on $ B_R$ and $ | \nabla \phi | \le \frac{C}{R}$ where $ C>0$ is independent of $ R$.   Putting this choice of $ \phi$ we obtain
 \begin{equation} \label{four}
 \int \omega_1 e^{2tu} \phi^{2m-2} | \nabla \phi |^2 \le \left( \int \omega_2 e^{(2t+1)u} \phi^{2m} \right)^\frac{2t}{2t+1} I_G^\frac{1}{2t+1}.
 \end{equation}  One similarly shows that
 \[ \int \omega_1 e^{2tu} \phi^{2m-1} | \Delta \phi| \le \left( \int \omega_2 e^{(2t+1)u} \phi^{2m} \right)^\frac{2t}{2t+1} I_G^\frac{1}{2t+1}.\]
 So, combining the results we obtain

 \begin{eqnarray} \label{last} \nonumber \frac{(2-t)}{2} \int \omega_2 e^{(2t+1) u} \phi^{2m} &\le& C_m \left( \int \omega_2 e^{(2t+1) u} \phi^{2m} dx \right)^\frac{2t}{2t+1} I_G^\frac{1}{2t+1}\\
 &&- D_m \int e^{2tu} \phi^{2m-1}  \nabla \omega_1 \cdot \nabla \phi.
 \end{eqnarray}
 We now estimate this last term.  A similar argument using H\""{o}lder's inequality shows that
 \[ \int e^{2tu} \phi^{2m-1} | \nabla \omega_1| | \nabla \phi| \le \left(  \int \omega_2 \phi^{2m} e^{(2t+1) u} dx \right)^\frac{2t}{2t+1} J_G^\frac{1}{2t+1}. \] Combining the results gives that
\begin{equation} \label{last}
(2-t) \left( \int \omega_2 e^{(2t+1) u} \phi^{2m} dx \right)^\frac{1}{2t+1} \le I_G^\frac{1}{2t+1} + J_G^\frac{1}{2t+1},
\end{equation} and now we send $ R \rightarrow \infty$ and use the fact that $ I_G, J_G \rightarrow 0$ as $ R \rightarrow \infty$ to see that
\[ \int \omega_2 e^{(2t+1) u} =0, \] which is clearly a contradiction.   Hence there is no stable sub-solution of $(G)$.

(2).   Suppose that $u >0$ is a stable sub-solution (super-solution) of $(L)$.  Then a similar calculation as in (1) shows that for  $ p - \sqrt{p(p-1)} <t < p + \sqrt{p(p-1)}$,  $( 0 <t<\frac{1}{2})$ one has

\begin{eqnarray}   \label{shit}
(p  -\frac{t^2}{2t-1}   )\int \omega_2 u^{2t+p-1} \phi^{2m} & \le & D_m \int \omega_1 u^{2t} \phi^{2(m-1)} (|\nabla\phi|^2  +\phi |\Delta \phi |) \nonumber \\
&& +C_m \frac{(1-t)}{2(2t-1)} \int u^{2t} \phi^{2m-1}\nabla \omega_1 \cdot  \nabla \phi.
 \end{eqnarray}    One now applies H\""{o}lder's argument as in (1) but the terms $ I_L$ and $J_L$ will appear on the right hand side of the resulting
 equation.      This shift from a sub-solution to a super-solution depending on whether $ t >\frac{1}{2}$ or $ t < \frac{1}{2}$ is a result from the sign change of $ 2t-1$ at $ t = \frac{1}{2}$.   We leave the details for the reader.


(3).  This case is also similar to (1) and (2).


\hfill $ \Box$

 \textbf{Proof of Theorem \ref{mono}.}   (1).  Again we suppose there is a stable sub-solution $u$ of $(G)$.  Our starting point  is (\ref{start_1}) and we wish to be able to drop the term
 \[ - D_m \int e^{2tu} \phi^{2m-1} \nabla \omega_1 \cdot \nabla \phi, \] from (\ref{start_1}).    We can choose $ \phi$ as in the proof of Theorem \ref{main_non_exist} but also such that $ \nabla \phi(x) = - C(x) x$ where $ C(x) \ge 0$.     So if we assume that $ \nabla \omega_1 \cdot x \le 0$ for big $x$ then we see that this last term is non-positive and hence we can drop the term.  The the proof is as before but now we only require that $ \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty} I_G=0$.

 (2).     Suppose that $ u >0$ is a stable sub-solution of $(L)$  and so (\ref{shit}) holds for all $  p - \sqrt{p(p-1)} <t< p + \sqrt{p(p-1)}$.   Now we wish to use monotonicity to drop the term from (\ref{shit}) involving the term $ \nabla \omega_1 \cdot \nabla \phi$.      $ \phi$ is chosen the same as in (1)  but here one notes that the co-efficient for this term changes sign at $ t=1$ and hence by restriction $t$ to the appropriate side of 1 (along with the above condition on $t$ and $\omega_1$) we can drop the last term depending on which monotonicity we have and hence to obtain a contraction we only require that $ \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty} I_L =0$.   The result for the non-existence of a stable super-solution is similar be here one restricts $ 0 < t < \frac{1}{2}$.


(3).  The proof here is similar to (1) and (2) and we omit the details.




 \hfill $\Box$













\textbf{Proof of Corollary \ref{thing}.}   We suppose  that $ \omega_1 \le C  \omega_2$  for big $ x$, $ \omega_2 \in L^\infty$,  $ \nabla \omega_1(x) \cdot  x \le 0$ for big $ x$.     \\
(1).    Since $ \nabla \omega_1 \cdot x \le 0$ for big $x$ we can apply Theorem \ref{mono} to show the non-existence of a stable solution to $(G)$.   Note that  with the above assumptions on $ \omega_i$ we have that
\[ I_G \le \frac{C R^N}{R^{4t+2}}.\]  For $ N \le 9$  we can take $ 0 <t<2$  but close enough to $2$ so the right hand side goes to zero as $ R \rightarrow \infty$.

Both (2) and (3) also follow directly from applying Theorem \ref{mono}.   Note that one can say more about (2) by taking the multiple cases as listed in Theorem \ref{mono} but we have choice to leave this to the reader.


\hfill $ \Box$


\textbf{Proof of Corollary \ref{po}.}   Since we have no monotonicity conditions now we will need both $I$ and $J$ to go to zero to show the non-existence of a stable solution.   Again the results are obtained immediately by applying Theorem \ref{main_non_exist}  and we prefer to omit the details.


\hfill $\Box$
















\textbf{Proof of Theorem \ref{alpha_beta}.}  (1).  If $ N + \alpha -2 <0$ then using Remark \ref{triv}  one easily sees there is no stable sub-solution of $(G)$ and $(L)$ (positive for $(L)$) or a positive stable super-solution of $(M)$.   So we now assume that $ N + \alpha -2 > 0$.     Note that the monotonicity of $ \omega_1$ changes when $ \alpha $ changes sign and hence one would think that we need to consider separate cases if we hope to utilize the monotonicity results.   But a computation shows that in fact $ I$ and $J$ are just multiples of each other in all three cases so it suffices to show, say, that $ \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty} I =0$. \\
(2).   Note that for $ R >1$ one has
\begin{eqnarray*}
I_G & \le  & \frac{C}{R^{4t+2}} \int_{R <|x| < 2R} |x|^{ \alpha (2t+1) - 2t \beta} \\
& \le  &  \frac{C}{R^{4t+2}}  R^{N + \alpha (2t+1) - 2t \beta},
\end{eqnarray*} and so to show the non-existence we want to find some $ 0 <t<2$ such that
$  4t+2 > N  + \alpha(2t+1) - 2 t \beta$,   which is equivalent to  $ 2t ( \beta - \alpha +2) > (N + \alpha -2)$.    Now recall that we are assuming that $ 0 < N + \alpha -2 < 4 ( \beta - \alpha +2) $ and hence we have the desired result by taking $  t <2$ but sufficiently close.
The proof of the non-existence results for
(3) and (4) are similar and we omit the details.   \\
(5).  We now assume that $N+\alpha-2>0$.  In showing the existence of stable sub/super-solutions we need to consider  $ \beta - \alpha + 2 <0$ and $ \beta - \alpha +2 >0$ separately.

\begin{itemize} \item $(\beta - \alpha + 2 <0)$  Here we take $ u(x)=0$ in the case of $(G)$ and $ u=1$ in the case of $(L)$ and $(M)$. In addition we take $ g(x)=\E$.  It is clear that in all cases $u$ is the appropriate sub or super-solution.  The only thing one needs to check is the stability.    In all cases this reduces to trying to show that we have
\[ \sigma \int       (1+|x|^2)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}  -1}    \phi^2 \le \int      (1+|x|^2)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}   | \nabla\phi  |^2,\]  for all $ \phi \in C_c^\infty$ where  $ \sigma $ is some small positive constant; its either $ \E$ or $ p \E$ depending on which equation were are examining.
To show this we use the result from Corollary \ref{Hardy} and we drop a few positive terms to arrive at
\begin{equation*}
\int (1+|x|^2)^\frac{\alpha}{2} |\nabla\phi|^2\ge (t+\frac{\alpha}{2})\int \left (N-2(t+1)   \frac{|x|^2}{1+|x|^2}\right) (1+|x|^2)^{-1+\frac{\alpha} {2}}
\end{equation*} which holds for all $ \phi \in C_c^\infty$ and $ t,\alpha \in {\mathbb{R}}$.
  Now, since $N+\alpha-2>0$, we can choose $t$ such that $-\frac{\alpha}{2}<t<\frac{n-2}{2}$.  So, the integrand function in the right hand side is positive and since for small enough $\sigma$ we have
  \begin{equation*}
\sigma \le  (t+\frac{\alpha}{2})(N-2(t+1)   \frac{|x|^2}{1+|x|^2})  \ \ \ \text {for all} \ \ x\in \mathbb{R}^N
\end{equation*}
 we get stability.



\item ($\beta-\alpha+2>0$) In the case of $(G)$ we take   $u(x)=-\frac{\beta-\alpha+2}{2} \ln(1+|x|^2)$ and $g(x):= (\beta-\alpha+2)(N+(\alpha-2)\frac{|x|^2}{1+|x|^2})$. By a computation one sees that $u$ is a sub-solution of $(G)$ and hence we need now to only show the stability, which amounts to showing that
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{g(x)\psi^2}{(1+|x|^{2   })^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}+1}}\le \int\frac{|\nabla\psi|^2}{    (1+|x|^2)^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}}     },
\end{equation*} for all $ \psi \in C_c^\infty$.  To show this we use  Corollary \ref{Hardy}.  So  we  need to choose an appropriate $t$ in   $-\frac{\alpha}{2}\le t\le\frac{N-2}{2}$  such that for all $x\in {\mathbb{R}}^N$ we have
 \begin{eqnarray*}
 (\beta-\alpha+2)\left(    N+  (\alpha-2)\frac{|x|^2}{1+|x|^2}\right)         &\le& (t+\frac{\alpha}{2})^2 \frac{ |x|^2 }{(1+|x|^2}\\
&&+(t+\frac{\alpha}{2}) \left(N-2(t+1)   \frac{|x|^2}{1+|x|^2}\right).
\end{eqnarray*}
With a  simple calculation one sees we need just to have
   \begin{eqnarray*}
 (\beta-\alpha+2)&\le& (t+\frac{\alpha}{2}) \\
  (\beta-\alpha+2)     \left(    N+  \alpha-2\right)      &   \le&  (t+\frac{\alpha}{2}) \left(N-t-2+\frac{\alpha}{2}) \right).
 \end{eqnarray*}     If one takes $ t= \frac{N-2}{2}$ in the case where $ N \neq 2$ and $ t $ close to zero in the case for $ N=2$ one easily sees the above inequalities both hold, after considering all the constraints on $ \alpha,\beta$ and $N$.

 We now consider the case of $(L)$.  Here one takes $g(x):=\frac {\beta-\alpha+2}{p-1}(    N+  (\alpha-2-\frac{\beta-\alpha+2}{p-1})
\frac{|x|^2}{1+|x|^2})$ and $ u(x)=(1+|x|^2)^{ -\frac  {\beta-\alpha+2}{2(p-1)} }$.   Using essentially the same approach as in $(G)$ one shows that $u$ is a stable sub-solution of $(L)$ with this choice of $g$.   \\
For the case of $(M)$ we take   $u(x)=(1+|x|^2)^{ \frac  {\beta-\alpha+2}{2(p+1)}   }$ and $g(x):=\frac {\beta-\alpha+2}{p+1}(    N+  (\alpha-2+\frac{\beta-\alpha+2}{p+1})
\frac{|x|^2}{1+|x|^2})$.



\end{itemize}

","[""$\\int f'(u) \\psi^2 \\le \\int | \\nabla \\psi|^2, \\forall \\psi \\in C_c^2$.""]",3743,multifieldqa_en,en,,135b82aecda3c83cfd73d1447e8f92a8a44de50ffdb09444," In this note we are interested in the existence versus non-existence of stable sub- and super-solutions of equations of the form. We say that a solution $ u $ of $ -\Delta u = f(u)$ in $ {\mathbb{R}}^N$ is stable provided $f$ is non-negative. We remark that some of these results are quite well understood, and we see that the case where these are not the case is quite different. We conclude that $u$ is a stable solution of (\ref{eq1}) where $ 0 is supported in a ball of radius $2R$ centered at the origin with $ \psi =1$ on $ B_R$ and such that $ C>0$ is independent of $ R$. In the right hand hand side we have the result that if $u $ is stable we have $ \int \omega_2 f' (u) =0 $ (provided $ f$ is increasing) and so if $ R goes to zero we have  $R < R \ right hand side. We also see that $C_c^2$ is the set of $ C#$ functions defined on $ $ R$ with compact support. There is no positive   stable sub-solution of $(G) if $ I_G, J_G \rightarrow 0$ as $ R   for some $0<t<2$. We remark that our approach to non-existence of stable solutions is the approach due to Farina. If we assume that the monotonicity conditions is satisfied for big $x$ we can do better than Farina's approach. We will now come to our main results in terms of abstract $ \omega_1 $ and $\omega-2$. The three equations we examine are: -div(    - div(         (G), -div (   1  2 )   (L), - div (   1 2 ) (L)  (M) (G) (L, M) (R) (C) (N) (P) (S) (B) (M, L) (X) (D) (E) (W) (F) (H) (A) (Z) (J) (K) (x) (Y) (z) (f) (r) (g) (h) (m) (b) (s) (e) (n) (l) (p) (i) (u) (j) (w) (a) (t) (c) (d) (1) (2) (expressed in $ {\mathbb{R}}^N$ } (G, M, L, J, R) (V) (Q) (v) (q) (k) (3) (4) ( Some of the conditions on $ \omega_i$ seem somewhat artificial. We omit the details because one cannot prove the results in a unified way. For this class of weights we can essentially obtain optimal results. Many of the above results can be extended to the case of equality in either the $ N + \alpha - 2 \ge 0$ and also the other inequality which depends on the equation we are  examining. If $ N+ \ alpha - 2 <0$ then there is no stable sub-solution for $ (G)$. If $N+\alpha-2 <4 then there are no  stable sub/super-solutions of $ (L)$. For more 2,3,4 are optimal in the sense if the remaining inequality is not satisfied then we can find a suitable function $ g(x)$ which satisfies the above properties and a stableSub-Super-Solution $u$ for the appropriate equation. For the remaining cases we assume that $ N. + \Alpha -2 > 0$. For this case we require that $N. +\alpha -2 <0$. For the rest of the cases we require it to be positive. We will show that an explicit Hardy inequality given in this case is given in the next section. We start with the inequality $ \phi$ where $ m $ is a big integer to obtain $ C_m$ and $ D_m. We now estimate the terms on the right but we mention that when ones assume the appropriate monotonicity on $ \omega_1$ it is the last integral on the left which one is able to drop. For fixed $ 0 <t<2$ we can take $m $ big enough so $ (2m-2) \frac{(2t+1)}{2t} \ge 2m $ and since $ 0 \le \phi \le 1$ this allows us to replace the power on $    with $2m$  and hence we obtain $C_m$. We now take the test functions $phi$ to be such that $ 0 phi$ is independent of $ R$. We obtain the choice of this of this $C-R$ we call ‘Hercules’ and ‘B-R’. The choice of $ C-R and $R-B’ is called ‘The Hercules test’, which is a test of the choice $ R-B$ of $ B-R. Theorem: A super-solution is a shift from a sub-solutions to a super-Solution depending on whether $ t >\frac{1}{2}$ or $ t < $ t. Theorem: The term $ u >0$ is a stable sub- solution of $(L)$ and so the co-efficient for this term changes sign at $ t=1$ and hence by restriction $t$ to the appropriate side of 1 we can drop the last term depending on which monotonicity we have and hence to obtain a contraction we only require that $ I_L$ and $J_L will appear on the right hand side of the resulting equation. The proof is similar to (1) and (2) and we omit the details. The result for the non-existence of a stable super- s solution is similar be here one restricts $ 0 < t <  1 /2 /3 /4 /5 /6 /7 /8 /9 /10 /11 /12 /13/14 /14/15/16/17/18/19/20/21/22/23/24/24, and so we follow directly from (3) Theorem. The proof of the non-existence results for (3) and (4) are similar and we omit the details. We now assume that $N+\alpha-2>0$. In showing the existence of stable sub/super-solutions we need to consider  $ \beta - \alpha + 2 <0$ and $ \ beta - \ alpha +2 >0$ separately. In all cases $u$ is the appropriate sub or super-solution. The only thing one needs to check is the stability. In the case of $x$ we take $u(=0) and $g(=1) and we drop a few positive terms to arrive at the result from Corollary \ref{Hardy. For small enough $\sigma$ we have a formula that holds for all $ \phi \in C_c^\infty and $ t,\alpha \in {\mathbb{R}}$. We can choose $t$ such that $-\frac{\alpha}{2}<t<\frac{n-2}{2}. So, the integrand function in the right hand side is positive and since for small enough $ \sigma $ we have the formula for the stability of a sub/Super-Super-Solution. rac {\beta-\alpha+2}{p+1}(    N+  (\alpha-2+\frac{\beta-‘a’+‘b’ + ‘c’) N+ (’alpha’-’a‘’’: ‘beta’, ‘a,’ ‘b,” ‘‘d’; ‘e’. ‘f’): ‘n’ : ‘1’"
What algorithm is engaged in the PLMS-PPIC method?,"\section{Introduction}\label{S1}

The multiple access interferences (MAI) is the root of user
limitation in CDMA systems \cite{R1,R3}. The parallel least mean
square-partial parallel interference cancelation (PLMS-PPIC) method
is a multiuser detector for code division multiple access (CDMA)
receivers which reduces the effect of MAI in bit detection. In this
method and similar to its former versions like LMS-PPIC \cite{R5}
(see also \cite{RR5}), a weighted value of the MAI of other users is
subtracted before making the decision for a specific user in
different stages \cite{cohpaper}. In both of these methods, the
normalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm is engaged
\cite{Haykin96}. The $m^{\rm th}$ element of the weight vector in
each stage is the true transmitted binary value of the $m^{\rm th}$
user divided by its hard estimate value from the previous stage. The
magnitude of all weight elements in all stages are equal to unity.
Unlike the LMS-PPIC, the PLMS-PPIC method tries to keep this
property in each iteration by using a set of NLMS algorithms with
different step-sizes instead of one NLMS algorithm used in LMS-PPIC.
In each iteration, the parameter estimate of the NLMS algorithm is
chosen whose element magnitudes of cancelation weight estimate have
the best match with unity. In PLMS-PPIC implementation it is assumed
that the receiver knows the phases of all user channels. However in
practice, these phases are not known and should be estimated. In
this paper we improve the PLMS-PPIC procedure \cite{cohpaper} in
such a way that when there is only a partial information of the
channel phases, this modified version simultaneously estimates the
phases and the cancelation weights. The partial information is the
quarter of each channel phase in $(0,2\pi)$.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section \ref{S4}
the modified version of PLMS-PPIC with capability of channel phase
estimation is introduced. In section \ref{S5} some simulation
examples illustrate the results of the proposed method. Finally the
paper is concluded in section \ref{S6}.

\section{Multistage Parallel Interference Cancelation: Modified PLMS-PPIC Method}\label{S4}

We assume $M$ users synchronously send their symbols
$\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\cdots,\alpha_M$ via a base-band CDMA
transmission system where $\alpha_m\in\{-1,1\}$. The $m^{th}$ user
has its own code $p_m(.)$ of length $N$, where $p_m(n)\in \{-1,1\}$,
for all $n$. It means that for each symbol $N$ bits are transmitted
by each user and the processing gain is equal to $N$. At the
receiver we assume that perfect power control scheme is applied.
Without loss of generality, we also assume that the power gains of
all channels are equal to unity and users' channels do not change
during each symbol transmission (it can change from one symbol
transmission to the next one) and the channel phase $\phi_m$ of
$m^{th}$ user is unknown for all $m=1,2,\cdots,M$ (see
\cite{cohpaper} for coherent transmission). According to the above
assumptions the received signal is
\begin{equation}
\label{e1} r(n)=\sum\limits_{m=1}^{M}\alpha_m
e^{j\phi_m}p_m(n)+v(n),~~~~n=1,2,\cdots,N,
\end{equation}
where $v(n)$ is the additive white Gaussian noise with zero mean and
variance $\sigma^2$. Multistage parallel interference cancelation
method uses $\alpha^{s-1}_1,\alpha^{s-1}_2,\cdots,\alpha^{s-1}_M$,
the bit estimates outputs of the previous stage, $s-1$, to estimate
the related MAI of each user. It then subtracts it from the received
signal $r(n)$ and makes a new decision on each user variable
individually to make a new variable set
$\alpha^{s}_1,\alpha^{s}_2,\cdots,\alpha^{s}_M$ for the current
stage $s$. Usually the variable set of the first stage (stage $0$)
is the output of a conventional detector. The output of the last
stage is considered as the final estimate of transmitted bits. In
the following we explain the structure of a modified version of the
PLMS-PIC method \cite{cohpaper} with simultaneous capability of
estimating the cancelation weights and the channel phases.

Assume $\alpha_m^{(s-1)}\in\{-1,1\}$ is a given estimate of
$\alpha_m$ from stage $s-1$. Define
\begin{equation}
\label{e6} w^s_{m}=\frac{\alpha_m}{\alpha_m^{(s-1)}}e^{j\phi_m}.
\end{equation}
From (\ref{e1}) and (\ref{e6}) we have
\begin{equation}
\label{e7} r(n)=\sum\limits_{m=1}^{M}w^s_m\alpha^{(s-1)}_m
p_m(n)+v(n).
\end{equation}
Define
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{e8} W^s&=&[w^s_{1},w^s_{2},\cdots,w^s_{M}]^T,\\
\label{e9}
\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!X^{s}(n)\!\!\!&=&\!\!\![\alpha^{(s-1)}_1p_1(n),\alpha^{(s-1)}_2p_2(n),\cdots,\alpha^{(s-1)}_Mp_M(n)]^T.
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $T$ stands for transposition. From equations (\ref{e7}),
(\ref{e8}) and (\ref{e9}), we have
\begin{equation}
\label{e10} r(n)=W^{s^T}X^{s}(n)+v(n).
\end{equation}
Given the observations $\{r(n),X^{s}(n)\}^{N}_{n=1}$, in modified
PLMS-PPIC, like the PLMS-PPIC \cite{cohpaper}, a set of NLMS
adaptive algorithm are used to compute
\begin{equation}
\label{te1} W^{s}(N)=[w^{s}_1(N),w^{s}_2(N),\cdots,w^{s}_M(N)]^T,
\end{equation}
which is an estimate of $W^s$ after iteration $N$. To do so, from
(\ref{e6}), we have
\begin{equation}
\label{e13} |w^s_{m}|=1 ~~~m=1,2,\cdots,M,
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
\label{e14} \sum\limits_{m=1}^{M}||w^s_{m}|-1|=0.
\end{equation}
We divide $\Psi=\left(0,1-\sqrt{\frac{M-1}{M}}\right]$, a sharp
range for $\mu$ (the step-size of the NLMS algorithm) given in
\cite{sg2005}, into $L$ subintervals and consider $L$ individual
step-sizes $\Theta=\{\mu_1,\mu_2,\cdots,\mu_L\}$, where
$\mu_1=\frac{1-\sqrt{\frac{M-1}{M}}}{L}, \mu_2=2\mu_1,\cdots$, and
$\mu_L=L\mu_1$. In each stage, $L$ individual NLMS algorithms are
executed ($\mu_l$ is the step-size of the $l^{th}$ algorithm). In
stage $s$ and at iteration $n$, if
$W^{s}_k(n)=[w^s_{1,k},\cdots,w^s_{M,k}]^T$, the parameter estimate
of the $k^{\rm th}$ algorithm, minimizes our criteria, then it is
considered as the parameter estimate at time iteration $n$. In other
words if the next equation holds
\begin{equation}
\label{e17} W^s_k(n)=\arg\min\limits_{W^s_l(n)\in I_{W^s}
}\left\{\sum\limits_{m=1}^{M}||w^s_{m,l}(n)|-1|\right\},
\end{equation}
where $W^{s}_l(n)=W^{s}(n-1)+\mu_l \frac{X^s(n)}{\|X^s(n)\|^2}e(n),
~~~ l=1,2,\cdots,k,\cdots,L-1,L$ and
$I_{W^s}=\{W^s_1(n),\cdots,W^s_L(n)\}$, then we have
$W^s(n)=W^s_k(n)$, and therefore all other algorithms replace their
weight estimate by $W^{s}_k(n)$. At time instant $n=N$, this
procedure gives $W^s(N)$, the final estimate of $W^s$, as the true
parameter of stage $s$.

Now consider $R=(0,2\pi)$ and divide it into four equal parts
$R_1=(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$, $R_2=(\frac{\pi}{2},\pi)$,
$R_3=(\pi,\frac{3\pi}{2})$ and $R_4=(\frac{3\pi}{2},2\pi)$. The
partial information of channel phases (given by the receiver) is in
a way that it shows each $\phi_m$ ($m=1,2,\cdots,M$) belongs to
which one of the four quarters $R_i,~i=1,2,3,4$. Assume
$W^{s}(N)=[w^{s}_1(N),w^{s}_2(N),\cdots,w^{s}_M(N)]^T$ is the weight
estimate of the modified algorithm PLMS-PPIC at time instant $N$ of
the stage $s$. From equation (\ref{e6}) we have
\begin{equation}
\label{tt3}
\phi_m=\angle({\frac{\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\alpha_m}w^s_m}).
\end{equation}
We estimate $\phi_m$ by $\hat{\phi}^s_m$, where
\begin{equation}
\label{ee3}
\hat{\phi}^s_m=\angle{(\frac{\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\alpha_m}w^s_m(N))}.
\end{equation}
Because $\frac{\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\alpha_m}=1$ or $-1$, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\phi}^s_m=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} \angle{w^s_m(N)} &
\mbox{if}~
\frac{\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\alpha_m}=1\\
\pm\pi+\angle{w^s_m(N)} & \mbox{if}~
\frac{\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\alpha_m}=-1\end{array}\right.
\end{eqnarray}
Hence $\hat{\phi}^s_m\in P^s=\{\angle{w^s_m(N)},
\angle{w^s_m(N)+\pi, \angle{w^s_m(N)}-\pi}\}$. If $w^s_m(N)$
sufficiently converges to its true value $w^s_m$, the same region
for $\hat{\phi}^s_m$ and $\phi_m$ is expected. In this case only one
of the three members of $P^s$ has the same region as $\phi_m$. For
example if $\phi_m \in (0,\frac{\pi}{2})$, then $\hat{\phi}^s_m \in
(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$ and therefore only $\angle{w^s_m(N)}$ or
$\angle{w^s_m(N)}+\pi$ or $\angle{w^s_m(N)}-\pi$ belongs to
$(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$. If, for example, $\angle{w^s_m(N)}+\pi$ is such
a member between all three members of $P^s$, it is the best
candidate for phase estimation. In other words,
\[\phi_m\approx\hat{\phi}^s_m=\angle{w^s_m(N)}+\pi.\]
We admit that when there is a member of $P^s$ in the quarter of
$\phi_m$, then $w^s_m(N)$ converges. What would happen when non of
the members of $P^s$ has the same quarter as $\phi_m$? This
situation will happen when the absolute difference between $\angle
w^s_m(N)$ and $\phi_m$ is greater than $\pi$. It means that
$w^s_m(N)$ has not converged yet. In this case where we can not
count on $w^s_m(N)$, the expected value is the optimum choice for
the channel phase estimation, e.g. if $\phi_m \in (0,\frac{\pi}{2})$
then $\frac{\pi}{4}$ is the estimation of the channel phase
$\phi_m$, or if $\phi_m \in (\frac{\pi}{2},\pi)$ then
$\frac{3\pi}{4}$ is the estimation of the channel phase $\phi_m$.
The results of the above discussion are summarized in the next
equation
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber \hat{\phi}^s_m = \left\{\begin{array}{llll} \angle
{w^s_m(N)} & \mbox{if}~
\angle{w^s_m(N)}, \phi_m\in R_i,~~i=1,2,3,4\\
\angle{w^s_m(N)}+\pi & \mbox{if}~ \angle{w^s_m(N)}+\pi, \phi_m\in
R_i,~~i=1,2,3,4\\
\angle{w^n_m(N)}-\pi & \mbox{if}~ \angle{w^s_m(N)}-\pi, \phi_m\in
R_i,~~i=1,2,3,4\\
\frac{(i-1)\pi+i\pi}{4} & \mbox{if}~ \phi_m\in
R_i,~~\angle{w^s_m(N)},\angle
{w^s_m(N)}\pm\pi\notin R_i,~~i=1,2,3,4.\\
\end{array}\right.
\end{eqnarray}
Having an estimation of the channel phases, the rest of the proposed
method is given by estimating $\alpha^{s}_m$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{tt4}
\alpha^{s}_m=\mbox{sign}\left\{\mbox{real}\left\{\sum\limits_{n=1}^{N}
q^s_m(n)e^{-j\hat{\phi}^s_m}p_m(n)\right\}\right\},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation} \label{tt5}
q^{s}_{m}(n)=r(n)-\sum\limits_{m^{'}=1,m^{'}\ne
m}^{M}w^{s}_{m^{'}}(N)\alpha^{(s-1)}_{m^{'}} p_{m^{'}}(n).
\end{equation}
The inputs of the first stage $\{\alpha^{0}_m\}_{m=1}^M$ (needed for
computing $X^1(n)$) are given by
\begin{equation}
\label{qte5}
\alpha^{0}_m=\mbox{sign}\left\{\mbox{real}\left\{\sum\limits_{n=1}^{N}
r(n)e^{-j\hat{\phi}^0_m}p_m(n)\right\}\right\}.
\end{equation}
Assuming $\phi_m\in R_i$, then
\begin{equation}
\label{qqpp} \hat{\phi}^0_m =\frac{(i-1)\pi+i\pi}{4}.
\end{equation}
Table \ref{tab4} shows the structure of the modified PLMS-PPIC
method. It is to be notified that
\begin{itemize}
\item Equation (\ref{qte5}) shows the conventional bit detection
method when the receiver only knows the quarter of channel phase in
$(0,2\pi)$. \item With $L=1$ (i.e. only one NLMS algorithm), the
modified PLMS-PPIC can be thought as a modified version of the
LMS-PPIC method.
\end{itemize}

In the following section some examples are given to illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

\section{Simulations}\label{S5}

In this section we have considered some simulation examples.
Examples \ref{ex2}-\ref{ex4} compare the conventional, the modified
LMS-PPIC and the modified PLMS-PPIC methods in three cases: balanced
channels, unbalanced channels and time varying channels. In all
examples, the receivers have only the quarter of each channel phase.
Example \ref{ex2} is given to compare the modified LMS-PPIC and the
PLMS-PPIC in the case of balanced channels.

\end{tabular} }}
\end{table}
Consider the system model (\ref{e7}) in which $M$ users
synchronously send their bits to the receiver through their
channels. It is assumed that each user's information consists of
codes of length $N$. It is also assumd that the signal to noise
ratio (SNR) is 0dB. In this example there is no power-unbalanced or
channel loss is assumed. The step-size of the NLMS algorithm in
modified LMS-PPIC method is $\mu=0.1(1-\sqrt{\frac{M-1}{M}})$ and
the set of step-sizes of the parallel NLMS algorithms in modified
PLMS-PPIC method are
$\Theta=\{0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2,\cdots,1\}(1-\sqrt{\frac{M-1}{M}})$,
i.e. $\mu_1=0.01(1-\sqrt{\frac{M-1}{M}}),\cdots,
\mu_4=0.2(1-\sqrt{\frac{M-1}{M}}),\cdots,
\mu_{12}=(1-\sqrt{\frac{M-1}{M}})$. Figure~\ref{Figexp1NonCoh}
illustrates the bit error rate (BER) for the case of two stages and
for $N=64$ and $N=256$. Simulations also show that there is no
remarkable difference between results in two stage and three stage
scenarios. Table~\ref{tabex5} compares the average channel phase
estimate of the first user in each stage and over $10$ runs of
modified LMS-PPIC and PLMS-PPIC, when the the number of users is
$M=15$.
\end{example}

Although LMS-PPIC and PLMS-PPIC, as well as their modified versions,
are structured based on the assumption of no near-far problem
(examples \ref{ex3} and \ref{ex4}), these methods and especially the
second one have remarkable performance in the cases of unbalanced
and/or time varying channels.

\end{table}
Consider example \ref{ex2} with power unbalanced and/or channel loss
in transmission system, i.e. the true model at stage $s$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{ve7} r(n)=\sum\limits_{m=1}^{M}\beta_m
w^s_m\alpha^{(s-1)}_m c_m(n)+v(n),
\end{equation}
where $0<\beta_m\leq 1$ for all $1\leq m \leq M$. Both the LMS-PPIC
and the PLMS-PPIC methods assume the model (\ref{e7}), and their
estimations are based on observations $\{r(n),X^s(n)\}$, instead of
$\{r(n),\mathbf{G}X^s(n)\}$, where the channel gain matrix is
$\mathbf{G}=\mbox{diag}(\beta_1,\beta_2,\cdots,\beta_m)$. In this
case we repeat example \ref{ex2}. We randomly get each element of
$G$ from $[0,0.3]$. Figure~\ref{Figexp2NonCoh} illustrates the BER
versus the number of users. Table~\ref{tabex6} compares the channel
phase estimate of the first user in each stage and over $10$ runs of
modified LMS-PPIC and modified PLMS-PPIC for $M=15$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
\label{ex4} {\it Time varying channels}: Consider example \ref{ex2}
with time varying Rayleigh fading channels. In this case we assume
the maximum Doppler shift of $40$HZ, the three-tap
frequency-selective channel with delay vector of $\{2\times
10^{-6},2.5\times 10^{-6},3\times 10^{-6}\}$sec and gain vector of
$\{-5,-3,-10\}$dB. Figure~\ref{Figexp3NonCoh} shows the average BER
over all users versus $M$ and using two stages.
\end{example}


\section{Conclusion}\label{S6}

In this paper, parallel interference cancelation using adaptive
multistage structure and employing a set of NLMS algorithms with
different step-sizes is proposed, when just the quarter of the
channel phase of each user is known. In fact, the algorithm has been
proposed for coherent transmission with full information on channel
phases in \cite{cohpaper}. This paper is a modification on the
previously proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the new
method has a remarkable performance for different scenarios
including Rayleigh fading channels even if the channel is
unbalanced.

Click here to read the full article. timating the cancelation weights and the channel phases. In each stage, the NLMS algorithms areexecuted ($L$ is the step-size of the L$ subintervals) In other words, if the algorithm minimizes our criteria, then it is considered as the parameter estimate at time $n$. In otherwords if the next word in the equation holds at iteration $n, then the algorithm holds as the estimate $k$ of the parameters $T$ and $m$ at time$n. In modified versions of PLMS-PPIC, a set of NLMS.adaptive algorithm are used to compute the algorithm. For example, in modified versions, the algorithm can be used to calculate $W^s$ after iteration $N$. To do so, from the equations (e7) and (e8) we have: From equations (\ref{e7), we have (e9), and from (e10) we are able to compute $W$ after iterations $N, $T, $L, $M, $S, $V, $N and $L$ for $W, $m, $J, $A, $B, $C, $D, $E, $F, $G, $H, $I, $K, $P, $R, $U, $Z, $W and $M$ are used in the analysis. We admit that when there is a member of $P^s$ in the quarter of $phi_m$ then $w^s_m(N)$ converges. In this case, the expected value is the optimum choice for channel phase estimation. The results of the above discussion are summarized in the nextequation. The first stage of the first stage is the estimation of the channel phase. The rest of the proposed method is given by estimating the phase of $alpha$ as follows:. The second stage is called the second stage and it is based on the third stage. The third stage is known as the fourth stage and is the third and final stage. This stage is used to estimate the fourth and fifth phases of the fourth phase of the fifth stage. For this stage, we use the following method:. We estimate the third phase as the fifth phase by adding the two fourths of the sixth and seventh stages together. We then estimate the final phase by multiplying these by the second and third stages. The result is the sixth stage, which is the seventh phase. We conclude that this method is the best way to estimate channel phases of $N$ and $M$ in terms of the number of members in $P*$ that are in the same region. Consider the system model in which $M$ users send their bits to the receiver. It is assumed that each user's information consists ofcodes of length $N$. It is also assumed that the signal to noise (SNR) is 0dB. In this example there is no power-unbalanced or                channel loss is assumed.

Who compiled the 88-page letter to the HHS regarding vaccine safety?,"A special tribute to Del Bigtree (pictured) and his team at ICAN for his stunning 88 page letter to the HHS regarding vaccine safety. As Del reported - in the latest edition of Highwire - the letter, in response to an earlier reply from the then acting Director National Vaccine Program Office, Melinda Wharton, took virtually a year to compile, and is a meticulous piece of research. Most sensationally they researched the HHS claim through US government archives that at least some pediatric vaccines had been trialed against genuine placebo, and came to a negative conclusion. Not only that, they established that none of the vaccines those vaccines had been trialed against had ever been trialed against genuine placebo either. At the end of the line the toxic products were only being compared with other toxic products, rather than against saline.
Leave aside the sceptics, for any believer in the vaccine program as a necessary intervention in public health, this should be a devastating finding. Fundamentally, the research into the safety of any of the products before marketing was simply not there. The manufacturers apparently had no faith that their proto-products could withstand this scrutiny, and for the rest they just did not care: under the alleged imperative of protecting the population it seems anything went. So even before all the sham monitoring procedures and reviews which Del and his team dismantle in forensic detail we are left with the proposition that none of the present products being given to US children – and frequently other children across most of the developed world – have any meaningful pre-marketing safety data all. If you are believer in the program you have been let down: if you wanted a program with any pretensions to safety - supposing such a thing to be possible - it looks like you would have to start from scratch. The manufacturers did this: the governments, the politicians and the regulators (internationally) let it happen.
This damning document is published simultaneously with a demand in the UK from the Royal Society for Public Health (which I had never heard of) to shut down comment about vaccines on the web. It echoes calls from Seth Berkley of GAVI, Heidi Larson of the Vaccine Confidence Project and the European Parliament. The pamphlet airily dismisses concerns that vaccines have side effects or that you could possibly have too many. It is pure public relations, and if the RSPH claims to be ""independent"" it also admits that the publication was paid for by Merck, a detail which was reported by British Medical Journal and the Guardian, but not true to form by the BBC. We have, in truth, been building to this moment for two decades: as the evidence piles up that every single aspect of the program lacks integrity or is simply rotten to the core all the perpetrators can do is call for the silencing of their critics, and maintain the products are safe because they say so.
Please help give the ICAN letter the widest possible distribution, particularly to politicians.
""The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system.""
Nope. This makes no sense. Lots of people who seemed vibrant will get a very severe case of the same illness that a vulnerable baby overcomes in a day.
And under the germ theory it doesn't matter how strong your immune system *was*. Once it's been overcome by the pathogen it is every bit as weak as anybody else's with that pathogen.
What you say makes no sense. There's no reason for me to reply to you again.
""Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared?""
Why do you keep asking this question when I've already provided the answer hundreds of times? Why are you so desperate to believe the people who you already recognize are harming our children?
Why would Walter Reed be any more trustworthy than Paul Offit or Senator Pan? Why would Jenner or Pasteur?
And you went no way to explaining my arguments against germ theory. If we are attacked by billions of viruses every day then if even a tiny fraction of them are pathogenic then we couldn't possibly survive. And even if we could, we would already be immune rendering every vaccine pointless. Once we had survived our first few days on earth, then we could never get sick again.
If that's wrong then we must conclude that precisely 0% of germs are pathogenic.
Plus your comment about the immune system completely misunderstood my point. The immune system does not allow us to overcome our math problem. In fact, it makes it worse.
You did provide one solitary example of a patient with what are presumably yellow fever symptoms but you didn't say whether they had been given any toxic medical treatments.
And like I said before, the whole ""incubation period"" is more than a little suspicious. Clearly they never found what they thought they would and just rigged the results to tell them what they want to hear.
Like every other germ theorist/vaccine promoter in history.
Many kinds of bacteria are constantly evolving and changing, like flu viruses. Others are more stable over time, like the yellow fever virus. Those that change develop new ways of infiltrating the cells of the organism being attacked (from our point of view, from its unconscious point of view, it's just carrying out its need to replicate, which it can only do inside the cells of its host). The changes which allow it to better infiltrate are more successful and result in more viruses with those traits.
Our immune system is designed to detect and destroy potentially dangerous invading pathogens. Many bacteria are usually harmless and absolutely necessary. The minority are dangerous, and most people's immune systems do a good job of analyzing them and killing them, often with no signs of disease. Others experience a clinical infection, and the immune system usually mounts a successful attack on them.
The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system. Vaccines are usually effective in giving immunity to the targeted diseases. They also have many dangers which everyone should be aware of, and vaccines should be avoided whenever possible. But in the case of the most dangerous diseases, everyone should learn about them and think about what he wants to do to protect himself and his children from them, considering all the factors involved. And no one can have 100% certainty that he has made the right decision, but that's life. But if you live in the Congo and many people around you are currently dying of yellow fever, then that means that you yourself are at risk of being bitten by a loaded mosquito and getting, often dying, of yellow fever. The yellow fever vaccine is very effective at preventing yellow fever. From there, each person must make a choice.
At the end of this stage there is a remission of two or three days. About 80% of those with clinical disease recover at this point, with permanent immunity. The other 20% enter the toxic stage, with a return of the fever, black vomit (coffee-ground emesis), diarrhea, a slowing of the pulse (Faget's sign), jaundice, yellow eyes, yellow skin, and failure of the kidneys, liver, and heart. The patient gets a strange hiccup (like with Ebola, a related disease), falls into a coma, and dies. About half of those patients who enter the toxic stage dies, even now, even with the best of hospital care. The Faget's sign can also occur at the end of the first stage.
You asked specifically about the symptoms of the Americans on Dr. Reed's team who got yellow fever in Cuba in 1900. I'll give the passage from The American Plague (162-5), which describes the course of Jesse Lazear's illness. ""In his logbook, Lazear wrote an unusual entry on September 13. In all cases before those, page after page of records, Lazear had used the soldier's name and simply the date he was bitten, with no other attention to the mosquito. A one-line entry with a name and a date. On that day, however, in his elegant hand, Lazear did not write the soldier's name, but instead wrote 'Guinea Pig No. 1.' He went on to write that this guinea pig had been bitten by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that fed on a number of yellow fever cases: Suarez, Hernández, De Long, Ferández. It was a precise, detailed history that proved beyond doubt that the mosquito was loaded with the virus when it bit a healthy soldier...(If he had entered his name, then his death would have been considered medical suicide by the insurance company, and his wife and two children would not have gotten any payment.) For the next few days, Lazear's life continued much as it had over the last few months in Cuba. He fed and cared for the mosquitoes in the lab. ..Then he began to lose his appetite. He skipped a few meals in the mess hall. He didn't mention it to anyone, nor did he ask to see one of the yellow fever doctors; instead, he worked hard in the lab trying to ignore the oncoming headache.
""On September 18, he complained of feeling 'out of sorts,' and stayed in his officer's quarters. His head pounded and L. decided to write a letter. ..(he wrote to his mother, and referred to his one-year old son Houston and the baby his wife Mabel was about to have: they were staying with his mother in the US). ..That night, L. started to feel chilled as the fever came on. He never went to sleep but worked at his desk all through the night, trying to get all the information about the mosquitoes organized. By morning, he showed all the signs of a severe attack of yellow fever. The camp doctors made the diagnosis, and L. agreed to go to the yellow fever ward. ..L. was carried by litter out of the two-room, white pine board house in which he had lived since he and Mabel first arrived in Cuba. ..(In the yellow fever ward, in a separate one-room building), Lena Warner (the immune nurse who had survived the yellow fever in 1878, when she was nine, and was found in her boarded-up house by a former slave who first thought she was dead, and carried her to safety) nursed J.L., recording his vitals. (I put up a link to his case record and vital signs last week. The surgeon general required that this record be made for every yellow fever patient.)... (On September 25,) Lena Warner braced L's arms with all of her weight, shouting for help. Still he bolted from the bed, darting around the small frame-wood room as wildly as a trapped insect beating against glass. Two soldiers ran into the ward, pinning L to his bed, tying restraints around his wrists and elbows. ..Warner sponged his body with iced whiskey and water. She recorded his temperature, which had held at 104 degrees for days, on the chart beside his bed. ..(Warner watched him sleep.) But the quiet did not last. L's body began to lurch, and black vomit rolled from his mouth; through the bar hanging above his hospital cot. He writhed in the bed, and his skin grew deep yellow. His 104 temperature slowly fell, leveling out 99 degrees, and JL died at 8:45 p.m. at the age of thirty-four.""
As is obvious, there are many problems with vaccines. But, that being said, most of them usually work for a period of time to prevent the targeted diseases. The basic science behind vaccines is correct. Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared? In the case of the routine childhood diseases, this was a bad thing, but it is a true thing.
Vaccines usually don't cause any obvious reactions. While they usually prevent the diseases, and that's why people continue to get them. With the increasing vaccination schedule, more and more are severely and permanently damaged, and it is immoral to mandate any vaccine for anyone for this reason. But it would also be immoral to prohibit vaccines for those who want them enough to take the risk.
Your article said as though it had any probative value that 90% of those who get pertussis had been vaxxed. The old DPT vaccine was MUCH more effective at preventing pertussis, but it was so dangerous (again, not to most, but to many), that developed countries replaced it with the acellular version, DTaP. From the beginning about twenty years ago, it was clear that it was not very effective and that huge numbers of vaxxed people got pertussis anyway, including my daughter who got pertussis at eight month old after having gotten three DTaPs. The pertussis vaccine continues to be very dangerous, and I do not recommend that anyone get it. It used to be a killer disease, but evolved to become much milder, to the extent that the disease is very rarely dangerous (usually only to newborns under three months old), while the vaccine is very dangerous. And they're trying to see how they can go back to the old DPT. This does not show that vaccine science has collapsed, but rather that the vaccine they developed to replace the DPT turned out to be much less effective than they first thought, while continuing to be much more dangerous than they first thought.
Your article extrapolated from that that modern medical science in general has collapsed, but that, again, is going too far. A older woman in Mexico City who is like my mother to me had a pacemaker inserted about two months ago to aid her failing heart, and it has restored her to optimism and energy, when she was despondent, weak, and close to death. I took my daughter to the dentist yesterday, who said she has three wisdom teeth coming in and that she said that the lower right one was sore. So, although I am cautious about X-rays, I made an appointment for a panoramic X-ray in a month to assess the wisdom teeth, and, if it seems appropriate, I'll take her to an oral surgeon to have one or more extracted under IV sedation, in his office, if possible (the dentist thought that it would be). And I am confident that there will be no serious problems, but this is thanks to technology and training in modern medicine that haven't been available for that long.
I think that everyone should inform himself on all medical procedures before agreeing to anything, but I also think that he should have access to any medical procedure which is reasonable (and opinions can differ as to that).
One problem is that you have not said how you think people should protect themselves against tetanus, bacterial meningitis, and yellow fever in the relevant cases, for example. These are diseases which healthy, well-nourished people used to die from very readily.
If most people stopped vaxxing and the mortality from these diseases rose to something like pre-vaccine levels, do you think they should just accept dying from them?
I put that in a separate paragraph because it is the crucial issue.

Hans, you are right that we are looking at one of the biggest crimes in all history. When I read the story of that poor girl who was so healthy and is now confined to a wheelchair after getting her third Gardasil shot I could not believe that Merck could produce such a toxic vaccine and give it out to girls like it was something they absolutely had to have only to be mislead and made into cripples. Merck should be prosecuted for the damage they have done to so many girls who got the Gardasil vaccine and were physically debilitated for life. There is a place for the people who perpetrated this crime on young girls and women and it is called hell. They have destroyed people's lives and gotten away with it. My heart goes out to those who have suffered this damage for no damn good reason except to help make huge profits for Merck!
Here is the reason that the germ theory is nonsense.
1) Everyday we are bombarded with billions of germs. Presumably at least some of them are of the kind that germ theorists believe are dangerous (otherwise we would have to conclude that none of them are dangerous). So how do we survive?
2) Let's just say that we ignore 1 and imagine that, by way of magic, none of the billions of viruses we get bombarded with are pathogenic but all those that are are tucked away somewhere. Ok. But presumably they reside in sick people right? So where are there lots of sick people? Doctor offices and hospitals! So everybody must be dying the moment they enter these places right?
3) I love this one because I have never seen anybody else ever raise it. Under the germ theory there are no negative feedbacks. This makes a stable biological system by definition impossible. The immune system is *not* a negative feedback it is the opposite. It actually reinforces our math problem because the immune system will weaken as the number of pathogens increase.
There is no way of resolving this problem without a discontinuity. A Deus ex Machina as The Almighty Pill so beautifully put it. So the germ theory is quite literally, mathematically impossible.
There is as much chance of it being true as 2+2 = 5.
There are plenty of other massive problems with germ theory such as why did things like SARS and bird flu magically disappear? Why do we have the symptoms that we do? Is our body controlling the symptoms to help fight the germs and if so, why would suppressing the symptoms with antibiotics or Tamiflu be considered a good idea? If the virus is causing the symptoms then why would it cause these kinds of things?",['Del Bigtree and his team at ICAN.'],3150,multifieldqa_en,en,,751053416f74a11311a13e801634fff8fd48649d3921b368," Del Bigtree and his team at ICAN wrote 88 page letter to the HHS regarding vaccine safety.

What molecule was the focus of the study?,"\section{Introduction}

Spectral line surveys have revealed that high-mass star-forming
regions are rich reservoirs of molecules from simple diatomic species
to complex and larger molecules (e.g.,
\citealt{schilke1997b,hatchell1998b,comito2005,bisschop2007}).
However, there have been rarely studies undertaken to investigate the
chemical evolution during massive star formation from the earliest
evolutionary stages, i.e., from High-Mass Starless Cores (HMSCs) and
High-Mass Cores with embedded low- to intermediate-mass protostars
destined to become massive stars, via High-Mass Protostellar Objects
(HMPOs) to the final stars that are able to produce Ultracompact H{\sc
  ii} regions (UCH{\sc ii}s, see \citealt{beuther2006b} for a recent
description of the evolutionary sequence). The first two evolutionary
stages are found within so-called Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs).  While
for low-mass stars the chemical evolution from early molecular
freeze-out to more evolved protostellar cores is well studied (e.g.,
\citealt{bergin1997,dutrey1997,pavlyuchenkov2006,joergensen2007}),
it is far from clear whether similar evolutionary patterns are present
during massive star formation.

To better understand the chemical evolution of high-mass star-forming
regions we initiated a program to investigate the chemical properties
from IRDCs to UCH{\sc ii}s from an observational and theoretical
perspective. We start with single-dish line surveys toward a large
sample obtaining their basic characteristics, and then perform
detailed studies of selected sources using interferometers on smaller
scales. These observations are accompanied by theoretical modeling of
the chemical processes.  Long-term goals are the chemical
characterization of the evolutionary sequence in massive star
formation, the development of chemical clocks, and the identification
of molecules as astrophysical tools to study the physical processes
during different evolutionary stages. Here, we present an initial
study of the reactive radical ethynyl (C$_2$H) combining single-dish
and interferometer observations with chemical modeling.  Although
C$_2$H was previously observed in low-mass cores and Photon Dominated
Regions (e.g., \citealt{millar1984,jansen1995}), so far it was not
systematically investigated in the framework of high-mass star
formation.

\section{Observations}
\label{obs}

The 21 massive star-forming regions were observed with the Atacama
Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) in the 875\,$\mu$m window in fall 2006.
We observed 1\,GHz from 338 to 339\,GHz and 1\,GHz in the image
sideband from 349 to 350\,GHz.  The spectral resolution was
0.1\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but we smoothed the data to
$\sim$0.9\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The average system temperatures were around
200\,K, each source had on-source integration times between 5 and 16
min. The data were converted to main-beam temperatures with forward
and beam efficiencies of 0.97 and 0.73, respectively
\citep{belloche2006}. The average $1\sigma$ rms was 0.4\,K.  The main
spectral features of interest are the C$_2$H lines around 349.4\,GHz
with upper level excitation energies $E_u/k$ of 42\,K (line blends of
C$_2$H$(4_{5,5}-3_{4,4})$ \& C$_2$H$(4_{5,4}-3_{4,3})$ at
349.338\,GHz, and C$_2$H$(4_{4,4}-3_{3,3})$ \&
C$_2$H$(4_{4,3}-3_{3,2})$ at 349.399\,GHz). The beam size was $\sim
18''$.

The original Submillimeter Array (SMA) C$_2$H data toward the
HMPO\,18089-1732 were first presented in \citet{beuther2005c}. There
we used the compact and extended configurations resulting in good
images for all spectral lines except of C$_2$H. For this project, we
re-worked on these data only using the compact configuration. Because
the C$_2$H emission is distributed on larger scales (see
\S\ref{results}), we were now able to derive a C$_2$H image. The
integration range was from 32 to 35\,km\,s$^{-1}$, and the achieved
$1\sigma$ rms of the C$_2$H image was 450\,mJy\,beam$^{-1}$.  For more
details on these observations see \citet{beuther2005c}.

\section{Results}
\label{results}

The sources were selected to cover all evolutionary stages from IRDCs
via HMPOs to UCH{\sc ii}s. We derived our target list from the samples
of \citet{klein2005,fontani2005,hill2005,beltran2006}.  Table
\ref{sample} lists the observed sources, their coordinates, distances,
luminosities and a first order classification into the evolutionary
sub-groups IRDCs, HMPOs and UCH{\sc ii}s based on the previously
available data. Although this classification is only based on a
limited set of data, here we are just interested in general
evolutionary trends. Hence, the division into the three main classes
is sufficient.

Figure \ref{spectra} presents sample spectra toward one source of each
evolutionary group. While we see several CH$_3$OH lines as well as
SO$_2$ and H$_2$CS toward some of the HMPOs and UCH{\sc ii}s but not
toward the IRDCs, the surprising result of this comparison is the
presence of the C$_2$H lines around 349.4\,GHz toward all source types
from young IRDCs via the HMPOs to evolved UCH{\sc ii}s.  Table
\ref{sample} lists the peak brightness temperatures, the integrated
intensities and the FWHM line-widths of the C$_2$H line blend at
349.399\,GHz. The separation of the two lines of 1.375\,MHz already
corresponds to a line-width of 1.2\,km\,s$^{-1}$. We have three C$_2$H
non-detections (2 IRDCs and 1 HMPO), however, with no clear trend with
respect to the distances or the luminosities (the latter comparison is
only possible for the HMPOs). While IRDCs are on average colder than
more evolved sources, and have lower brightness temperatures, the
non-detections are more probable due to the relatively low sensitivity
of the short observations (\S\ref{obs}). Hence, the data indicate
that the C$_2$H lines are detected independent of the evolutionary
stage of the sources in contrast to the situation with other
molecules.  When comparing the line-widths between the different
sub-groups, one finds only a marginal difference between the IRDCs and
the HMPOs (the average $\Delta v$ of the two groups are 2.8 and
3.1\,km\,s$^{-1}$).  However, the UCH{\sc ii}s exhibit significantly
broader line-widths with an average value of 5.5\,km\,s$^{-1}$.

Intrigued by this finding, we wanted to understand the C$_2$H spatial
structure during the different evolutionary stages.  Therefore, we
went back to a dataset obtained with the Submillimeter Array toward
the hypercompact H{\sc ii} region IRAS\,18089-1732 with a much higher
spatial resolution of $\sim 1''$ \citep{beuther2005c}.  Albeit this
hypercompact H{\sc ii} region belongs to the class of HMPOs, it is
already in a relatively evolved stage and has formed a hot core with a
rich molecular spectrum.  \citet{beuther2005c} showed the spectral
detection of the C$_2$H lines toward this source, but they did not
present any spatially resolved images. To recover large-scale
structure, we restricted the data to those from the compact SMA
configuration (\S\ref{obs}). With this refinement, we were able to
produce a spatially resolved C$_2$H map of the line blend at
349.338\,GHz with an angular resolution of $2.9''\times 1.4''$
(corresponding to an average linear resolution of 7700\,AU at the
given distance of 3.6\,kpc). Figure \ref{18089} presents the
integrated C$_2$H emission with a contour overlay of the 860\,$\mu$m
continuum source outlining the position of the massive protostar. In
contrast to almost all other molecular lines that peak along with the
dust continuum \citep{beuther2005c}, the C$_2$H emission surrounds the
continuum peak in a shell-like fashion.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

To understand the observations, we conducted a simple chemical
modeling of massive star-forming regions. A 1D cloud model with a mass
of 1200\,M$_\sun$, an outer radius of 0.36\,pc and a power-law density
profile ($\rho\propto r^p$ with $p=-1.5$) is the initially assumed
configuration. Three cases are studied: (1) a cold isothermal cloud
with $T=10$\,K, (2) $T=50$\,K, and (3) a warm model with a temperature
profile $T\propto r^q$ with $q=-0.4$ and a temperature at the outer
radius of 44\,K. The cloud is illuminated by the interstellar UV
radiation field (IRSF, \citealt{draine1978}) and by cosmic ray
particles (CRP). The ISRF attenuation by single-sized $0.1\mu$m
silicate grains at a given radius is calculated in a plane-parallel
geometry following \citet{vandishoeck1988}. The CRP ionization rate is
assumed to be $1.3\times 10^{-17}$~s$^{-1}$ \citep{spitzer1968}. The
gas-grain chemical model by \citet{vasyunin2008} with the desorption
energies and surface reactions from \citet{garrod2006} is used.
Gas-phase reaction rates are taken from RATE\,06 \citep{woodall2007},
initial abundances, were adopted from the ``low metal'' set of
\citet{lee1998}.

Figure \ref{model} presents the C$_2$H abundances for the three models
at two different time steps: (a) 100\,yr, and (b) in a more evolved
stage after $5\times10^4$\,yr. The C$_2$H abundance is high toward the
core center right from the beginning of the evolution, similar to
previous models (e.g., \citealt{millar1985,herbst1986,turner1999}).
During the evolution, the C$_2$H abundance stays approximately
constant at the outer core edges, whereas it decreases by more than
three orders of magnitude in the center, except for the cold $T=10$~K
model.  The C$_2$H abundance profiles for all three models show
similar behavior.

The chemical evolution of ethynyl is determined by relative removal
rates of carbon and oxygen atoms or ions into molecules like CO, OH,
H$_2$O. Light ionized hydrocarbons CH$^+_{\rm n}$ (n=2..5) are quickly
formed by radiative association of C$^+$ with H$_2$ and hydrogen
addition reactions: C$^+$ $\rightarrow$ CH$_2^+$ $\rightarrow$
CH$_3^+$ $\rightarrow$ CH$_5^+$.  The protonated methane reacts with
electrons, CO, C, OH, and more complex species at later stage and
forms methane.  The CH$_4$ molecules undergo reactive collisions with
C$^+$, producing C$_2$H$_2^+$ and C$_2$H$_3^+$. An alternative way to
produce C$_2$H$_2^+$ is the dissociative recombination of CH$_5^+$
into CH$_3$ followed by reactions with C$^+$.  Finally, C$_2$H$_2^+$
and C$_2$H$_3^+$ dissociatively recombine into CH, C$_2$H, and
C$_2$H$_2$. The major removal for C$_2$H is either the direct
neutral-neutral reaction with O that forms CO, or the same reaction
but with heavier carbon chain ions that are formed from C$_2$H by
subsequent insertion of carbon. At later times, depletion and
gas-phase reactions with more complex species may enter into this
cycle.  At the cloud edge the interstellar UV radiation
instantaneously dissociates CO despite its self-shielding,
re-enriching the gas with elemental carbon.

The transformation of C$_2$H into CO and other species proceeds
efficiently in dense regions, in particular in the ``warm'' model
where endothermic reactions result in rich molecular complexity of the
gas (see Fig.~\ref{model}).  In contrast, in the ``cold'' 10\,K model
gas-grain interactions and surface reactions become important.  As a
result, a large fraction of oxygen is locked in water ice that is hard
to desorb ($E_{\rm des} \sim 5500$~K), while half of the elemental
carbon goes to volatile methane ice ($E_{\rm des} \sim 1300$~K). Upon
CRP heating of dust grains, this leads to much higher gas-phase
abundance of C$_2$H in the cloud core for the cold model compared to
the warm model. The effect is not that strong for less dense regions
at larger radii from the center.

Since the C$_2$H emission is anti-correlated with the dust continuum
emission in the case of IRAS\,18089-1732 (Fig.\,\ref{18089}), we do
not have the H$_2$ column densities to quantitatively compare the
abundance profiles of IRAS\,18089-1732 with our model. However, data
and model allow a qualitative comparison of the spatial structures.
Estimating an exact evolutionary time for IRAS\,18089-1732 is hardly
possible, but based on the strong molecular line emission, its high
central gas temperatures and the observed outflow-disk system
\citep{beuther2004a,beuther2004b,beuther2005c}, an approximate age of
$5\times10^4$\,yr appears reasonable.  Although dynamical and chemical
times are not necessarily exactly the same, in high-mass star
formation they should not differ to much: Following the models by
\citet{mckee2003} or \citet{krumholz2006b}, the luminosity rises
strongly right from the onset of collapse which can be considered as a
starting point for the chemical evolution. At the same time disks and
outflows evolve, which should hence have similar time-scales.  The
diameter of the shell-like C$_2$H structure in IRAS\,18089-1732 is
$\sim 5''$ (Fig.\,\ref{18089}), or $\sim$9000\,AU in radius at the
given distance of 3.6\,kpc.  This value is well matched by the modeled
region with decreased C$_2$H abundance (Fig.\,\ref{model}).  Although
in principle optical depths and/or excitation effects could mimic the
C$_2$H morphology, we consider this as unlikely because the other
observed molecules with many different transitions all peak toward the
central submm continuum emission in IRAS\,18089-1732
\citep{beuther2005c}. Since C$_2$H is the only exception in that rich
dataset, chemical effects appear the more plausible explanation.

The fact that we see C$_2$H at the earliest and the later evolutionary
stages can be explained by the reactive nature of C$_2$H: it is
produced quickly early on and gets replenished at the core edges by
the UV photodissociation of CO. The inner ``chemical'' hole observed
toward IRAS\,18089-1732 can be explained by C$_2$H being consumed in
the chemical network forming CO and more complex molecules like larger
carbon-hydrogen complexes and/or depletion.

The data show that C$_2$H is not suited to investigate the central gas
cores in more evolved sources, however, our analysis indicates that
C$_2$H may be a suitable tracer of the earliest stages of (massive)
star formation, like N$_2$H$^+$ or NH$_3$ (e.g.,
\citealt{bergin2002,tafalla2004,beuther2005a,pillai2006}). While a
spatial analysis of the line emission will give insights into the
kinematics of the gas and also the evolutionary stage from chemical
models, multiple C$_2$H lines will even allow a temperature
characterization. With its lowest $J=1-0$ transitions around 87\,GHz,
C$_2$H has easily accessible spectral lines in several bands between
the 3\,mm and 850\,$\mu$m.  Furthermore, even the 349\,GHz lines
presented here have still relatively low upper level excitation
energies ($E_u/k\sim42$\,K), hence allowing to study cold cores even
at sub-millimeter wavelengths.  This prediction can further be proved
via high spectral and spatial resolution observations of different
C$_2$H lines toward young IRDCs.

"When was Weep Not, Child first published?","Weep Not, Child is a 1964 novel by Kenyan author Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o. It was his first novel, published in 1964 under the name James Ngugi. It was among the African Writers Series. It was the first English language|English novel to be published by an East African. Thiong'o's works deal with the relationship between Africans and white settlers in colonial Kenya, and are heavily critical of colonial rule. Specifically, Weep Not, Child deals with the Mau Mau Uprising, and ""the bewildering dispossession of an entire people from their ancestral land."" Ngũgĩ wrote the novel while he was a student at Makerere University.

The book is divided into two parts and eighteen chapters. Part one deals mostly with the education of Njoroge, while part two deals with the rising Mau Mau movement.

Plot summary

Njoroge, a little boy, is urged to attend school by his mother. He is the first one of his family able to go to school. His family lives on the land of Jacobo, an African made rich by his dealings with white settlers, namely Mr. Howlands, the most powerful land owner in the area. Njoroge's brother Kamau works as an apprentice to a carpenter, while Boro, the eldest living son, is troubled by his experiences while in forced service during World War II, including witnessing the death of his elder brother. Ngotho, Njoroge's father and a respected man in the surrounding area, tends Mr. Howlands' crops, but is motivated by his passion to preserve his ancestral land, rather than for any compensation or loyalty.

One day, black workers call for a strike to obtain higher wages. Ngotho is ambivalent about participating in the strike because he fears he will lose his job. However, he decides to go to the gathering, even though his two wives do not agree. At the demonstration, there are calls for higher wages. Suddenly, the white police inspector brings Jacobo to the gathering to pacify the native people. Jacobo tries to put an end to the strike. Ngotho attacks Jacobo, and the result is a riot where two people are killed. Jacobo survives and swears revenge. Ngotho loses his job and Njoroge’s family is forced to move. Njoroge’s brothers fund his education and seem to lose respect for their father.

Mwihaki, Jacobo's daughter and Njoroge's best friend, enters a girls' only boarding school, leaving Njoroge relatively alone. He reflects upon her leaving, and realizes that he was embarrassed by his father's actions towards Jacobo. For this reason, Njoroge is not upset by her exit and their separation. Njoroge switches to another school.

For a time, everyone's attention is focused on the upcoming trial of Jomo Kenyatta – a revered leader of the movement. Many blacks think that he is going to bring forth Kenya’s independence. But Jomo loses the trial and is imprisoned. This results in further protests and greater suppression of the black population.

Jacobo and a white landowner, Mr. Howlands, fight against the rising activities of the Mau Mau, an organization striving for Kenyan economic, political, and cultural independence. Jacobo accuses Ngotho of being the leader of the Mau Mau and tries to imprison the whole family. Meanwhile, the situation in the country is deteriorating. Six black men are taken out of their houses and executed in the woods.

One day Njoroge meets Mwihaki again, who has returned from boarding school. Although Njoroge had planned to avoid her due to the conflict between their fathers, their friendship is unaffected. Njoroge passes an important exam that allows him to advance to High School. His village is proud of him, and collects money to pay Njoroge's High School tuition.

Several months later, Jacobo is murdered in his office by a member of the Mau Mau. Mr. Howlands has Njoroge removed from school for questioning. Both father and son are brutally beaten before release and Ngotho is left barely alive. Although there doesn't seem to be a connection between Njoroge's family and the murder, it is eventually revealed that Njoroge's brothers are behind the assassination, and that Boro is the real leader of the Mau Mau. Ngotho soon dies from his injuries and Njoroge finds out that his father was protecting his brothers. Kamau has been imprisoned for life. Only Njoroge and his two mothers remain free, and Njoroge is left as the sole provider of his two mothers. Njoroge fears that he cannot make ends meet; he gives up hope of continuing in school and loses faith in God.

Njoroge asks Mwihaki's for support, but she is angry because of her father’s death. When he finally pledges his love to her, she refuses to leave with him, realizing her obligation to Kenya and her mother. Njoroge decides to leave town and makes an attempt at suicide; however, he fails when his mothers find him before he is able to hang himself. The novel closes with Njoroge feeling hopeless, and ashamed of cowardice.

Characters in Weep Not, Child
 Njoroge: the main character of the book whose main goal throughout the book is to become as educated as possible.
 Ngotho: Njoroge's father. He works for Mr.Howlands and is respected by him until he attacks Jacobo at a workers strike. He is fired and the family is forced to move to another section of the country. Over the course of the book his position as the central power of the family weakened, to the point where his self-realization that he has spent his whole life waiting for the prophecy (that proclaims the blacks will be returned their land) to come true rather than fighting for Kenyan independence, leads to his depression.
 Nyokabi and Njeri: the two wives of Ngotho. Njeri is Ngotho's first wife, and mother of Boro, Kamau, and Kori. Nyokabi is his second wife, and the mother of Njoroge and Mwangi.
 Njoroge has four brothers: Boro, Kamau, Kori and Mwangi (who is Njoroge's only full brother, who died in World War II).
 Boro: Son of Njeri who fights for the Allies in World War II. Upon returning his anger against the colonial government is compounded by their confiscation of the his land. Boro's anger and position as eldest son leads him to question and ridicule Ngotho, which eventually defeats their father's will (upon realizing his life was wasted waiting and not acting). It is eventually revealed that Boro is the leader of the Mau Mau (earlier alluded to as ""entering politics"") and murders Mr.Howlands. He is caught by police immediately after and is scheduled to be executed by the book's end. It is highly likely that it is also Boro who kills Jacobo.
 Mwihaki: Njoroge's best friend (and later develops into his love interest). Daughter of Jacobo. When it is revealed that his family killed Jacobo (most likely Boro), Mwihaki distances herself from Njoroge, asking for time to mourn her father and care for her mother.
 Jacobo: Mwihaki's father and an important landowner. Chief of the village.
 Mr. Howlands: A white settler who emigrated to colonial Kenya and now owns a farm made up of land that originally belonged to Ngotho's ancestors. Has three children: Peter who died in World War II before the book's beginning, a daughter who becomes a missionary, and Stephen who met Njoroge while the two were in high school.

Themes and motifs
Weep Not, Child integrates Gikuyu mythology and the ideology of nationalism that serves as catalyst for much of the novel's action. The novel explores the negative aspects of colonial rule over Kenya. Njoroge's aspiration to attend university is frustrated by both the violence of the Mau Mau rebels and the violent response of the colonial government. This disappointment leads to his alienation from his family and ultimately his suicide attempt.

The novel also ponders the role of saviours and salvation. The author notes in his The River Between: ""Salvation shall come from the hills. From the blood that flows in me, I say from the same tree, a son shall rise. And his duty shall be to lead and save the people."" Jomo Kenyatta, the first prime minister of Kenya, is immortalised in Weep Not, Child. The author says, ""Jomo had been his (Ngotho's) hope. Ngotho had come to think that it was Jomo who would drive away the white man. To him, Jomo stood for custom and traditions purified by grace of learning and much travel."" Njoroge comes to view Jomo as a messiah who will win the struggle against the colonial government.

What is the relationship between the maximum velocity and the amplitude of the blob or depletion?,"\section{Model equations} \label{sec:equations}

In drift-fluid models the continuity equation
\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial n}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\left( n \vec u_E  \right) &= 0 \label{eq:generala} 
\end{align}
describes the dynamics of the electron density $n$. Here
$\vec u_E := (\hat{\vec b} \times \nabla \phi)/B$ gives the electric drift
velocity in a magnetic field $\vec B := B \hat{\vec b}$ and an electric
potential $\phi$. We neglect contributions of the diamagnetic drift~\cite{Kube2016}.




Equation~\eqref{eq:generala} is closed by invoking quasineutrality, i.e. the divergence of the ion polarization, 
the electron diamagnetic and the gravitational drift currents must vanish
\begin{align}
  \nabla\cdot\left( \frac{n}{\Omega} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t} 
  + \vec u_E \cdot\nabla  \right)\frac{\nabla_\perp \phi}{B}  + n\vec u_d - n\vec u_g\right) &=0
  . 
 
 
  \label{eq:generalb}
\end{align}
Here we denote 
$\nabla_\perp\phi/B := - \hat{\vec b} \times \vec u_E$, 
the electron diamagnetic drift
$\vec u_d := - T_e(\hat{\vec b} \times\nabla n ) /enB$
with the electron temperature $T_e$,
the ion gravitational drift velocity  
$\vec u_g := m_i \hat{\vec b} \times \vec g /B$
with ion mass $m_i$, and the ion gyro-frequency
$\Omega := eB/m_i$.

Combining Eq.~\eqref{eq:generalb} with Eq.~\eqref{eq:generala} yields
\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\left( \rho\vec u_E \right) + \nabla \cdot\left( n(\vec u_\psi + \vec u_d + \vec u_g) \right) &= 0\label{eq:vorticity}
\end{align}
with the polarization charge density 
$\rho = \nabla\cdot( n\nabla_\perp \phi / \Omega B)$ 
and
$\vec u_\psi := \hat{\vec b}\times \nabla\psi /B$ 
with 
$\psi:= m_i\vec u_E^2 /2e$.
We exploit this form of Eq.~\eqref{eq:generalb} in our numerical simulations.

Equations~\eqref{eq:generala} and \eqref{eq:generalb} respectively \eqref{eq:vorticity} have several invariants.
First, in Eq.~\eqref{eq:generala} the relative particle number 
$M(t) := \int \mathrm{dA}\, (n-n_0)$ is conserved over time
$\d M(t)/\d t = 0$. 
Furthermore, we integrate 
$( T_e(1+\ln n) -T_e \ln B)\partial_t n$
as well as
$-e\phi \partial_t\rho - (m_i\vec u_E^2/2+gm_ix - T_e\ln B)\partial_t n$ 
over the domain to get, disregarding boundary contributions,
\begin{align}
  \frac{\d}{\d t}\left[T_eS(t) + H(t) \right] = 0, \label{eq:energya}\\ 
    \frac{\d}{\d t} \left[ E(t) - G(t) - H(t)\right] =  0,
    \label{eq:energyb}
\end{align}
where we define 
the entropy
$S(t):=\int \mathrm{dA}\, [n\ln(n/n_0) - (n-n_0)]$,  
the kinetic energy 
$E(t):=m_i \int \mathrm{dA}\, n\vec u_E^2/2$ 
and the potential energies
$G(t) := m_i g\int \mathrm{dA}\, x(n-n_0)$
and
$H(t) := T_e\int \mathrm{dA}\, (n-n_0) \ln (B^{-1})$.
Note that $n\ln( n/n_0) - n + n_0 \approx (n-n_0)^2/2$ for $|(n-n_0)/n_0| \ll 1$ and $S(t)$ thus reduces to the 
local entropy form in Reference~\cite{Kube2016}. 

We now set up a gravitational field $\vec g = g\hat x$ and a constant homogeneous background
magnetic field $\vec B = B_0 \hat z$ in a Cartesian coordinate system.
Then the divergences of the electric and gravitational drift velocities $\nabla\cdot\vec u_E$ and $\nabla\cdot\vec u_g$
and the diamagnetic current $\nabla\cdot(n\vec u_d)$ vanish, which makes the 
flow incompressible. Furthermore, the magnetic potential energy vanishes $H(t) = 0$.

In a second system we model the inhomogeneous magnetic field present in tokamaks as
$\vec B := B_0 (1+ x/R_0)^{-1}\hat z$ and neglect the gravitational drift $\vec u_g = 0$.
Then, the potential energy $G(t) = 0$. 
Note that 
$H(t) = m_i \ensuremath{C_\mathrm{s}}^2/R_0\int\mathrm{dA}\, x(n-n_0) +\mathcal O(R_0^{-2}) $
reduces to $G(t)$ with the effective gravity $g_\text{eff}:= \ensuremath{C_\mathrm{s}}^2/R_0$ with $\ensuremath{C_\mathrm{s}}^2 := T_e/m_i$. 
For the rest of this letter we treat $g$ and $g_\text{eff}$ as well as $G(t)$ and $H(t)$ on the same footing.
The magnetic field inhomogeneity thus entails compressible flows, which is 
the only difference to the model describing dynamics in a homogeneous magnetic field introduced above. 
Since both $S(t)\geq 0$ and $E(t)\geq 0$ we further derive from Eq.~\eqref{eq:energya} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:energyb} that the kinetic energy
is bounded by $E(t) \leq T_eS(t) + E(t) = T_e S(0)$; a feature absent from the gravitational system with 
incompressible flows, where $S(t) = S(0)$. 

We now show that the invariants Eqs.~\eqref{eq:energya} and \eqref{eq:energyb} present restrictions on the velocity and
acceleration of plasma blobs. 
First, we define the blobs' center of mass (COM) via $X(t):= \int\mathrm{dA}\, x(n-n_0)/M$ and 
its COM velocity as $V(t):=\d X(t)/\d t$. 
The latter is proportional to the total radial particle flux~\cite{Garcia_Bian_Fundamensky_POP_2006, Held2016a}.
We assume
that $n>n_0$ and $(n-n_0)^2/2 \leq [ n\ln (n/n_0) - (n-n_0)]n $ to show for both systems 
\begin{align}
  (MV)^2 &= \left( \int \mathrm{dA}\, n{\phi_y}/{B} \right)^2
  = \left( \int \mathrm{dA}\, (n-n_0){\phi_y}/{B} \right)^2\nonumber\\
 
&\leq 2 \left( \int \mathrm{dA}\, \left[n\ln (n/n_0) -(n-n_0)\right]^{1/2}\sqrt{n}{\phi_y}/{B}\right)^2\nonumber\\
 
  &\leq 4 S(0) E(t)/m_i 
 
  \label{eq:inequality}
\end{align}
Here we use the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and 
$\phi_y:=\partial\phi/\partial y$. 
Note that although we derive the inequality Eq.~\eqref{eq:inequality} only for amplitudes $\triangle n >0$  we assume that the results also hold for depletions. This is justified by our numerical results later in this letter. 
If we initialize our density field with a seeded blob of radius $\ell$ and amplitude $\triangle n$ as 
\begin{align}
  n(\vec x, 0) &= n_0 + \triangle n \exp\left( -\frac{\vec x^2}{2\ell^2} \right), \label{eq:inita}
 
 
\end{align}
and  
$\phi(\vec x, 0 ) = 0$,
we immediately have $M := M(0) = 2\pi \ell^2 \triangle n$, $E(0) = G(0) = 0$ and 
$S(0) = 2\pi \ell^2 f(\triangle n)$, where $f(\triangle n)$ captures the amplitude dependence of 
the integral for $S(0)$. 

The acceleration for both incompressible and compressible flows can be estimated
by assuming a linear acceleration $V=A_0t$ and $X=A_0t^2/2$~\cite{Held2016a} and using 
$E(t) = G(t) = m_igMX(t)$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:inequality}
\begin{align}
  \frac{A_0}{g} =  \mathcal Q\frac{2S(0)}{M} \approx \frac{\mathcal Q}{2} \frac{\triangle n }{n_0+2\triangle n/9}.
  \label{eq:acceleration}
\end{align}
Here, we use the Pad\'e approximation of order $(1/1)$ of $2S(0)/M $
and define a model parameter $\mathcal Q$ with $0<\mathcal Q\leq1$ to be determined by numerical simulations.
Note that the Pad\'e approximation is a better approximation than a simple 
truncated Taylor expansion especially for large relative amplitudes of order unity.
Eq.~\eqref{eq:acceleration} predicts that $A_0/g\sim \triangle n/n_0$ for small 
amplitudes $|\triangle n/n_0| < 1$ and $A_0 \sim g $ for very large amplitudes $\triangle n /n_0 \gg 1$, 
which confirms the predictions in~\cite{Pecseli2016} and reproduces the limits discussed in~\cite{Angus2014}.

As pointed out earlier for compressible flows Eq.~\eqref{eq:inequality} can be further estimated
\begin{align}
  (MV)^2  \leq 4 T_eS(0)^2/m_i. 
  \label{}
\end{align}
We therefore have a restriction on the maximum COM velocity for compressible flows, which is absent for incompressible flows
\begin{align}
  \frac{\max |V|}{\ensuremath{C_\mathrm{s}}} = {\mathcal Q}\frac{2S(0)}{M} \approx \frac{\mathcal Q}{2} \frac{|\triangle n| }{n_0+2/9 \triangle n } \approx \frac{\mathcal Q}{2} \frac{|\triangle n|}{n_0}.
  \label{eq:linear}
\end{align}
For $|\triangle n /n_0|< 1$ Eq.~\eqref{eq:linear} reduces to the linear scaling derived in~\cite{Kube2016}. 
Finally, a scale analysis of Eq.~\eqref{eq:vorticity} shows that~\cite{Ott1978, Garcia2005, Held2016a}
\begin{align}
  \frac{\max |V|}{\ensuremath{C_\mathrm{s}}} = \mathcal R \left( \frac{\ell}{R_0}\frac{|\triangle n|}{n_0} \right)^{1/2}.
  \label{eq:sqrt}
\end{align}
This equation predicts a square root dependence of the center of mass velocity 
on amplitude and size. 





We now propose a simple phenomenological model that captures the essential dynamics
of blobs and depletions in the previously stated systems. More specifically 
the model reproduces the acceleration Eq.~\eqref{eq:acceleration} with and without
Boussinesq approximation, the square root scaling for the COM velocity 
Eq.~\eqref{eq:sqrt} for incompressible flows as well as the relation between the 
square root scaling Eq.~\eqref{eq:sqrt} and the linear scaling 
Eq.~\eqref{eq:linear} for compressible flows. 
The basic idea is that the COM of blobs behaves like 
the one of an infinitely long plasma column immersed in an ambient plasma. 
The dynamics of this column reduces to the one of a two-dimensional ball.
This idea is similar to the analytical ``top hat'' density solution for
blob dynamics recently studied in~\cite{Pecseli2016}.
The ball is subject to buoyancy as well as linear and nonlinear friction
\begin{align}
  M_{\text{i}} \frac{d V}{d t} = (M_{\text{g}} - M_\text{p}) g - c_1 V  - \mathrm{sgn}(V ) \frac{1}{2}c_2 V^2.
  \label{eq:ball}
\end{align}
The gravity $g$ has a positive sign in the coordinate system; sgn$(f)$ is the sign function. 
The first term on the right hand side is the buoyancy, where 
$M_{\text{g}} := \pi \ell^2 (n_0 + \mathcal Q \triangle n/2)$ 
is the gravitational mass of the ball with radius $\ell$ and 
$M_\mathrm{p} := n_0 \pi \ell^2 $ 
is the mass of the displaced ambient plasma.
Note that if $\triangle n<0$ the ball represents a depletion and the buoyancy term has a negative sign, i.e. the depletion will rise. 
We introduce an inertial mass 
$M_{\text{i}} := \pi\ell^2 (n_0 +2\triangle n/9)$ 
different from the gravitational mass $M_{\text{g}}$ in order to 
recover the initial acceleration in Eq.~\eqref{eq:acceleration}. 
We interpret the parameters $\mathcal Q$ and $2/9$ as geometrical factors 
that capture the difference of the actual blob form from the idealized
``top hat'' solution. 
Also note that the Boussinesq approximation appears in the model as a neglect of inertia, $M_{\text{i}} = \pi\ell^2n_0$.

The second term is the linear friction term with coefficient $c_1(\ell)$, which
depends on the size of the ball.
If we disregard the nonlinear friction, $c_2=0$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:ball} directly yields a 
maximum velocity $c_1V^*=\pi \ell^2 n g \mathcal Q\triangle n/2$.
From our previous considerations $\max V/\ensuremath{C_\mathrm{s}}=\mathcal Q \triangle n /2n_0$, we thus identify 
\begin{align}
  c_1 = \pi\ell^2 n_0 g/\ensuremath{C_\mathrm{s}}. 
  \label{}
\end{align}
The linear friction coefficient thus depends on the gravity and the size of the
ball. 

The last term in \eqref{eq:ball} is the nonlinear friction. The sign of the force depends on whether
the ball rises or falls in the ambient plasma. 
If we disregard linear friction $c_1=0$, we have the maximum velocity 
$V^*= \sigma(\triangle n)\sqrt{\pi \ell^2|\triangle n| g\mathcal Q/c_2}$, 
which must equal 
$\max V= \sigma(\triangle n) \mathcal R \sqrt{g \ell |\triangle n/n_0|}$ 
and thus
\begin{align}
  c_2 = {\mathcal Q\pi n_0\ell }/{\mathcal R^2}.
  \label{}
\end{align}
Inserting $c_1$ and $c_2$ into Eq.~\eqref{eq:ball}
we can derive the maximum absolute velocity in the form 
\begin{align}
  \frac{\max |V|}{\ensuremath{C_\mathrm{s}}} = 
        \left(\frac{\mathcal R^2}{\mathcal Q}\right) \frac{\ell}{R_0} \left( 
        \left({1+\left( \frac{\mathcal Q}{\mathcal R} \right)^{2} \frac{|\triangle n|/n_0 }{\ell/R_0}}\right)^{1/2}-1 \right)
  \label{eq:vmax_theo}
\end{align}
and thus have a concise expression for $\max |V|$ that captures both the linear
scaling \eqref{eq:linear} as well as the square root scaling \eqref{eq:sqrt}.
With Eq.~\eqref{eq:acceleration} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:sqrt} respectively Eq.~\eqref{eq:vmax_theo} we 
finally arrive at an analytical expression for the time at which the maximum velocity is reached via 
$t_{\max V} \sim \max V/A_0$. Its inverse $\gamma:=t_{\max V}^{-1}$ gives the
global interchange growth rate, for which an empirical expression was
presented in Reference~\cite{Held2016a}.


We use the open source library FELTOR 
to simulate 
Eqs.~\eqref{eq:generala} and \eqref{eq:vorticity} with and without 
drift compression.
For numerical stabilty we added small diffusive terms on the right hand 
sides of the equations.
The discontinuous Galerkin methods employ three polynomial coefficients and a minimum of $N_x=N_y=768$ grid cells. The box size is $50\ell$ in order to mitigate 
influences of the finite box size on the blob dynamics. 
Moreover, we used the invariants in Eqs. \eqref{eq:energya} and \eqref{eq:energyb} as consistency tests to verify the code and repeated simulations 
also in a gyrofluid model. 
No differences to the results presented here were found. 
Initial perturbations on the particle density field are given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:inita},
where the perturbation amplitude $\triangle n/n_0$ was chosen between $10^{-3}$ and $20$ for blobs and $-10^0$ and $ -10^{-3}$ for depletions. 
Due to computational reasons we show results only for $\triangle n/n_0\leq 20$. 


For compressible flows we consider two different cases $\ell/R_0 = 10^{-2}$ and
$\ell /R_0 = 10^{-3}$. 
 For incompressible flows Eq.~\eqref{eq:generala} and \eqref{eq:vorticity}
 can be normalized such that the blob radius is absent from the equations~\cite{Ott1978, Kube2012}. 
 The simulations of incompressible flows can thus be used for both sizes. 
The numerical code as well as input parameters and output data can be found 
in the supplemental dataset to this contribution~\cite{Data2017}.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:com_blobs} we plot the maximum COM velocity for blobs 
with and without drift compression.
For incompressible flows blobs follow the square root scaling almost 
perfectly. Only at very large amplitudes velocities are slightly below
the predicted values. 
For small amplitudes we observe that the compressible blobs follow
a linear scaling. When the amplitudes increase there is a transition to the
square root scaling at around $\triangle n/n_0 \simeq 0.5$ for 
$\ell/R_0=10^{-2}$ and $\triangle n/n_0 \simeq 0.05$ for $\ell/R_0=10^{-3}$, which is consistent with Eq.~\eqref{eq:vmax_theo} and Reference~\cite{Kube2016}. 
In the transition regions the simulated velocities are slightly larger than the predicted ones from Eq.~\eqref{eq:vmax_theo}.
Beyond these amplitudes
the velocities of compressible and incompressible blobs align.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:com_depletions} we show the maximum radial COM velocity 
for depletions instead of blobs.
For relative amplitudes below $|\triangle n|/n_0 \simeq 0.5$ (right of unity in the plot) the velocities
coincide with the corresponding blob velocities in Fig.~\ref{fig:com_blobs}. 
 For amplitudes larger than $|\triangle n|/n_0\simeq 0.5$ the 
velocities follow the square root scaling.
We observe that for plasma depletions beyond $90$ percent the velocities 
in both systems reach a constant value that is very well predicted by the
square root scaling.

We compare the simulation results
to the theoretical predictions Eq.~\eqref{eq:acceleration} of our model with and without inertia. 
The results of the compressible and incompressible systems coincide and fit very
well to our theoretical values. 
For amplitudes larger than unity the acceleration deviates significantly from the prediction with Boussinesq approximation.

    \label{fig:acc_depletions}
\end{figure}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:acc_depletions} we show the simulated acceleration of depletions in the
compressible and the incompressible systems. We compare the simulation results
to the theoretical predictions Eq.~\eqref{eq:acceleration} of our model with and without inertia.
Deviations from our theoretical prediction Eq.~\eqref{eq:acceleration} are visible for amplitudes smaller than $\triangle n/n_0 \simeq -0.5$ (left of unity in the plot). The relative deviations are small at around $20$ percent. 
As in Fig.~\ref{fig:com_depletions} the acceleration reaches a constant values
for plasma depletions of more than $90$ percent.
Comparing Fig.~\ref{fig:acc_depletions} to Fig.~\ref{fig:acc_blobs} the asymmetry between blobs and depletions becomes 
apparent. While the acceleration of blobs is reduced for large 
amplitudes compared to a linear dependence the acceleration 
of depletions is increased. In the language of our simple buoyancy 
model the inertia of depletions is reduced but increased for blobs. 



In conclusion  
  we discuss the dynamics of seeded blobs and depletions in a 
  compressible and an incompressible system.
  With only two fit parameters our theoretical results reproduce the 
  numerical COM velocities and accelerations over five orders of magnitude.
  We derive the amplitude dependence of the acceleration of blobs and depletions from 
  the conservation laws of our systems in Eq.~\eqref{eq:acceleration}. 
  From the same inequality a linear regime is derived in the compressible system for 
  ratios of amplitudes to sizes smaller than a critical value.
   In this regime 
  the blob and depletion velocity depends linearly on the initial amplitude and 
  is independent of size. The regime is absent from the system with incompressible flows.
  Our theoretical results are verified by numerical simulations for all 
  amplitudes that are relevant in magnetic fusion devices.
  Finally, we suggest a new empirical blob model that captures the detailed dynamics of more complicated models. 
  The Boussinesq approximation is clarified as the absence of inertia and a thus altered acceleration of blobs and depletions.
  The maximum blob velocity is not altered by the Boussinesq approximation.

We exploit this form of Eq.~\eqref{eq:generalb} in our numerical simulations. The relative particle number $M(t) is conserved over time and is called the relative energy of the system. We integrate the model using the following equations: Eq.   “EQ. ”, “E.’, ‘E. ’,” and “’”. We also use the equations ‘’ and ’’ to represent the charge density and charge height of the charged particles. We conclude that the model’s equations can be used to calculate the energy and charge of a charged particle in terms of the charge height and charge weight of the electrons. We call this the ‘energy’ equation ‘e’. The ‘vorticity’ function ‘V’ is used to measure the energy of a particle in the model. We use the equation ’s ’E’ as well as the equations’ ’C’ for ‘voltage’ (‘v’). ference to the model describing dynamics in a homogeneous magnetic field introduced above. The kinetic energy of a plasma blobs is bounded by $E(t) \leq T_eS(t), where $S( t) = S(0)$. The acceleration for both incompressible and compressible flows can be estimated by assuming a linear acceleration $V=A_0tt and $X_0_t/2$ for both systems. We assumethat $n>n_0$ and $n-n-0)^2/2 is the total radial particle flux. We use the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and $phi_y:=\partial\phi/\partial y$ for our density field. We also use the Padinese approximation of order of order $1/1/2/1, where $M=M(0), $E=E, and $G=G. The results also hold for depletions, which is justified by our numerical results later in this letter. We conclude that our model is correct for both the gravitational and the compressible systems, and that the model is more accurate for the gravitational system than for the compressable one. The model is now ready to be used in the next section of this article. We now propose a simple phenomenological model that captures the essential dynamics of blobs and depletions in the previously stated systems. The model reproduces the acceleration with and without the Boussinesq approximation. The dynamics of this column reduces to the one of a two-dimensional ball. The ball is subject to buoyancy as well as linear and nonlinear friction. The force of the force depends on whether the ball falls in the ambient plasma or rises in the plasma. We have the maximum velocity $c_1V^*=\pi \ell^2 n g \mathcal Q\triangle n/2$, which must equal equal to the mass velocity $V*= c_1 v/2 g/\ensuremath{C_\mathrm{s}}. The friction coefficient thus depends on the size of the ball and on the sign of the gravity and the friction coefficient. We conclude that the model captures the dynamics of an infinitely long plasma column immersed in an ambient plasma in the form of a ball. We call this the ""top hat'' density solution for Blob dynamics, which was recently studied in a paper by Pecseli2016. We hope the model will be of interest to the physics community. We use the open source library FELTOR to simulate the global interchange growth rate. The maximum radial COM velocities of blobs for compressible and incompressible flows are shown. We plot the maximum COM velocity for blobs  with and without drift compression. The numerical code as well as input parameters and output data can be found in the supplemental dataset to this contribution. We show results only for $\triangle n/n_0\leq 20$ for depletions.

What do dendritic spines contain?,"JoVE | Peer Reviewed Scientific Video Journal - Methods and Protocols
A role for thrombospondin-1 deficits in astrocyte-mediated spine and synaptic pathology in Downs syndrome. Octavio Garcia, Maria Torres, Pablo Helguera, Pinar Coskun, Jorge Busciglio.
PUBLISHED: 07-02-2010	Downs syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation. Reduced number and aberrant architecture of dendritic spines are common features of DS neuropathology. However, the mechanisms involved in DS spine alterations are not known. In addition to a relevant role in synapse formation and maintenance, astrocytes can regulate spine dynamics by releasing soluble factors or by physical contact with neurons. We have previously shown impaired mitochondrial function in DS astrocytes leading to metabolic alterations in protein processing and secretion. In this study, we investigated whether deficits in astrocyte function contribute to DS spine pathology.
Analysis of Dendritic Spine Morphology in Cultured CNS Neurons Authors: Deepak P. Srivastava, Kevin M. Woolfrey, Peter Penzes. Published: 07-13-2011 JoVE Neuroscience
Dendritic spines are the sites of the majority of excitatory connections within the brain, and form the post-synaptic compartment of synapses. These structures are rich in actin and have been shown to be highly dynamic. In response to classical Hebbian plasticity as well as neuromodulatory signals, dendritic spines can change shape and number, which is thought to be critical for the refinement of neural circuits and the processing and storage of information within the brain. Within dendritic spines, a complex network of proteins link extracellular signals with the actin cyctoskeleton allowing for control of dendritic spine morphology and number. Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that a number of disease states, ranging from schizophrenia to autism spectrum disorders, display abnormal dendritic spine morphology or numbers. Moreover, recent genetic studies have identified mutations in numerous genes that encode synaptic proteins, leading to suggestions that these proteins may contribute to aberrant spine plasticity that, in part, underlie the pathophysiology of these disorders. In order to study the potential role of these proteins in controlling dendritic spine morphologies/number, the use of cultured cortical neurons offers several advantages. Firstly, this system allows for high-resolution imaging of dendritic spines in fixed cells as well as time-lapse imaging of live cells. Secondly, this in vitro system allows for easy manipulation of protein function by expression of mutant proteins, knockdown by shRNA constructs, or pharmacological treatments. These techniques allow researchers to begin to dissect the role of disease-associated proteins and to predict how mutations of these proteins may function in vivo.

Institutions: University of Freiburg , University of Freiburg .Astrocytes are an abundant cell type in the mammalian brain, yet much remains to be learned about their molecular and functional characteristics. In vitro astrocyte cell culture systems can be used to study the biological functions of these glial cells in detail. This video protocol shows how to obtain pure astrocytes by isolation and culture of mixed cortical cells of mouse pups. The method is based on the absence of viable neurons and the separation of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia, the three main glial cell populations of the central nervous system, in culture. Representative images during the first days of culture demonstrate the presence of a mixed cell population and indicate the timepoint, when astrocytes become confluent and should be separated from microglia and oligodendrocytes. Moreover, we demonstrate purity and astrocytic morphology of cultured astrocytes using immunocytochemical stainings for well established and newly described astrocyte markers. This culture system can be easily used to obtain pure mouse astrocytes and astrocyte-conditioned medium for studying various aspects of astrocyte biology.Neuroscience, Issue 71, Neurobiology, Cellular Biology, Medicine, Molecular Biology, Anatomy, Physiology, brain, mouse, astrocyte culture, astrocyte, fibroblast, fibrinogen, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, neuronal regeneration, cell culture, animal model50079Play ButtonImaging Dendritic Spines of Rat Primary Hippocampal Neurons using Structured Illumination MicroscopyAuthors: Marijn Schouten, Giulia M. R. De Luca, Diana K. Alatriste González, Babette E. de Jong, Wendy Timmermans, Hui Xiong, Harm Krugers, Erik M. M. Manders, Carlos P. Fitzsimons. Institutions: University of Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam.Dendritic spines are protrusions emerging from the dendrite of a neuron and represent the primary postsynaptic targets of excitatory inputs in the brain. Technological advances have identified these structures as key elements in neuron connectivity and synaptic plasticity. The quantitative analysis of spine morphology using light microscopy remains an essential problem due to technical limitations associated with light's intrinsic refraction limit. Dendritic spines can be readily identified by confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy. However, measuring subtle changes in the shape and size of spines is difficult because spine dimensions other than length are usually smaller than conventional optical resolution fixed by light microscopy's theoretical resolution limit of 200 nm.
Several recently developed super resolution techniques have been used to image cellular structures smaller than the 200 nm, including dendritic spines. These techniques are based on classical far-field operations and therefore allow the use of existing sample preparation methods and to image beyond the surface of a specimen. Described here is a working protocol to apply super resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to the imaging of dendritic spines in primary hippocampal neuron cultures. Possible applications of SIM overlap with those of confocal microscopy. However, the two techniques present different applicability. SIM offers higher effective lateral resolution, while confocal microscopy, due to the usage of a physical pinhole, achieves resolution improvement at the expense of removal of out of focus light. In this protocol, primary neurons are cultured on glass coverslips using a standard protocol, transfected with DNA plasmids encoding fluorescent proteins and imaged using SIM. The whole protocol described herein takes approximately 2 weeks, because dendritic spines are imaged after 16-17 days in vitro, when dendritic development is optimal. After completion of the protocol, dendritic spines can be reconstructed in 3D from series of SIM image stacks using specialized software.Neuroscience, Issue 87, Dendritic Spine, Microscopy, Confocal, Fluorescence, Neurosciences, hippocampus, primary neuron, super resolution microscopy, structured illumination microscopy (SIM), neuroscience, dendrite51276Play ButtonSetting-up an In Vitro Model of Rat Blood-brain Barrier (BBB): A Focus on BBB Impermeability and Receptor-mediated TransportAuthors: Yves Molino, Françoise Jabès, Emmanuelle Lacassagne, Nicolas Gaudin, Michel Khrestchatisky. Institutions: VECT-HORUS SAS, CNRS, NICN UMR 7259.The blood brain barrier (BBB) specifically regulates molecular and cellular flux between the blood and the nervous tissue. Our aim was to develop and characterize a highly reproducible rat syngeneic in vitro model of the BBB using co-cultures of primary rat brain endothelial cells (RBEC) and astrocytes to study receptors involved in transcytosis across the endothelial cell monolayer. Astrocytes were isolated by mechanical dissection following trypsin digestion and were frozen for later co-culture. RBEC were isolated from 5-week-old rat cortices. The brains were cleaned of meninges and white matter, and mechanically dissociated following enzymatic digestion. Thereafter, the tissue homogenate was centrifuged in bovine serum albumin to separate vessel fragments from nervous tissue. The vessel fragments underwent a second enzymatic digestion to free endothelial cells from their extracellular matrix. The remaining contaminating cells such as pericytes were further eliminated by plating the microvessel fragments in puromycin-containing medium. They were then passaged onto filters for co-culture with astrocytes grown on the bottom of the wells. RBEC expressed high levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins such as occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1 with a typical localization at the cell borders. The transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of brain endothelial monolayers, indicating the tightness of TJs reached 300 ohm·cm2 on average. The endothelial permeability coefficients (Pe) for lucifer yellow (LY) was highly reproducible with an average of 0.26 ± 0.11 x 10-3 cm/min. Brain endothelial cells organized in monolayers expressed the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), showed a polarized transport of rhodamine 123, a ligand for P-gp, and showed specific transport of transferrin-Cy3 and DiILDL across the endothelial cell monolayer. In conclusion, we provide a protocol for setting up an in vitro BBB model that is highly reproducible due to the quality assurance methods, and that is suitable for research on BBB transporters and receptors.Medicine, Issue 88, rat brain endothelial cells (RBEC), mouse, spinal cord, tight junction (TJ), receptor-mediated transport (RMT), low density lipoprotein (LDL), LDLR, transferrin, TfR, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER),51278Play ButtonInducing Plasticity of Astrocytic Receptors by Manipulation of Neuronal Firing RatesAuthors: Alison X. Xie, Kelli Lauderdale, Thomas Murphy, Timothy L. Myers, Todd A. Fiacco. Institutions: University of California Riverside, University of California Riverside, University of California Riverside.Close to two decades of research has established that astrocytes in situ and in vivo express numerous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that can be stimulated by neuronally-released transmitter. However, the ability of astrocytic receptors to exhibit plasticity in response to changes in neuronal activity has received little attention. Here we describe a model system that can be used to globally scale up or down astrocytic group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in acute brain slices. Included are methods on how to prepare parasagittal hippocampal slices, construct chambers suitable for long-term slice incubation, bidirectionally manipulate neuronal action potential frequency, load astrocytes and astrocyte processes with fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, and measure changes in astrocytic Gq GPCR activity by recording spontaneous and evoked astrocyte Ca2+ events using confocal microscopy. In essence, a “calcium roadmap” is provided for how to measure plasticity of astrocytic Gq GPCRs. Applications of the technique for study of astrocytes are discussed. Having an understanding of how astrocytic receptor signaling is affected by changes in neuronal activity has important implications for both normal synaptic function as well as processes underlying neurological disorders and neurodegenerative disease.Neuroscience, Issue 85, astrocyte, plasticity, mGluRs, neuronal Firing, electrophysiology, Gq GPCRs, Bolus-loading, calcium, microdomains, acute slices, Hippocampus, mouse51458Play ButtonInhibitory Synapse Formation in a Co-culture Model Incorporating GABAergic Medium Spiny Neurons and HEK293 Cells Stably Expressing GABAA ReceptorsAuthors: Laura E. Brown, Celine Fuchs, Martin W. Nicholson, F. Anne Stephenson, Alex M. Thomson, Jasmina N. Jovanovic. Institutions: University College London.Inhibitory neurons act in the central nervous system to regulate the dynamics and spatio-temporal co-ordination of neuronal networks. GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) is the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. It is released from the presynaptic terminals of inhibitory neurons within highly specialized intercellular junctions known as synapses, where it binds to GABAA receptors (GABAARs) present at the plasma membrane of the synapse-receiving, postsynaptic neurons. Activation of these GABA-gated ion channels leads to influx of chloride resulting in postsynaptic potential changes that decrease the probability that these neurons will generate action potentials. During development, diverse types of inhibitory neurons with distinct morphological, electrophysiological and neurochemical characteristics have the ability to recognize their target neurons and form synapses which incorporate specific GABAARs subtypes. This principle of selective innervation of neuronal targets raises the question as to how the appropriate synaptic partners identify each other. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, a novel in vitro co-culture model system was established, in which medium spiny GABAergic neurons, a highly homogenous population of neurons isolated from the embryonic striatum, were cultured with stably transfected HEK293 cell lines that express different GABAAR subtypes. Synapses form rapidly, efficiently and selectively in this system, and are easily accessible for quantification. Our results indicate that various GABAAR subtypes differ in their ability to promote synapse formation, suggesting that this reduced in vitro model system can be used to reproduce, at least in part, the in vivo conditions required for the recognition of the appropriate synaptic partners and formation of specific synapses. Here the protocols for culturing the medium spiny neurons and generating HEK293 cells lines expressing GABAARs are first described, followed by detailed instructions on how to combine these two cell types in co-culture and analyze the formation of synaptic contacts.

Institutions: University of California, Santa Cruz.In the mammalian cortex, neurons form extremely complicated networks and exchange information at synapses. Changes in synaptic strength, as well as addition/removal of synapses, occur in an experience-dependent manner, providing the structural foundation of neuronal plasticity. As postsynaptic components of the most excitatory synapses in the cortex, dendritic spines are considered to be a good proxy of synapses. Taking advantages of mouse genetics and fluorescent labeling techniques, individual neurons and their synaptic structures can be labeled in the intact brain. Here we introduce a transcranial imaging protocol using two-photon laser scanning microscopy to follow fluorescently labeled postsynaptic dendritic spines over time in vivo. This protocol utilizes a thinned-skull preparation, which keeps the skull intact and avoids inflammatory effects caused by exposure of the meninges and the cortex. Therefore, images can be acquired immediately after surgery is performed. The experimental procedure can be performed repetitively over various time intervals ranging from hours to years. The application of this preparation can also be expanded to investigate different cortical regions and layers, as well as other cell types, under physiological and pathological conditions.Neuroscience, Issue 87, dendritic spine, mouse cortex, in vivo, two-photon microscopy, thinned-skull, imaging51520Play ButtonModeling Astrocytoma Pathogenesis In Vitro and In Vivo Using Cortical Astrocytes or Neural Stem Cells from Conditional, Genetically Engineered MiceAuthors: Robert S. McNeill, Ralf S. Schmid, Ryan E. Bash, Mark Vitucci, Kristen K. White, Andrea M. Werneke, Brian H. Constance, Byron Huff, C. Ryan Miller. Institutions: University of North Carolina School of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine.Current astrocytoma models are limited in their ability to define the roles of oncogenic mutations in specific brain cell types during disease pathogenesis and their utility for preclinical drug development. In order to design a better model system for these applications, phenotypically wild-type cortical astrocytes and neural stem cells (NSC) from conditional, genetically engineered mice (GEM) that harbor various combinations of floxed oncogenic alleles were harvested and grown in culture. Genetic recombination was induced in vitro using adenoviral Cre-mediated recombination, resulting in expression of mutated oncogenes and deletion of tumor suppressor genes. The phenotypic consequences of these mutations were defined by measuring proliferation, transformation, and drug response in vitro. Orthotopic allograft models, whereby transformed cells are stereotactically injected into the brains of immune-competent, syngeneic littermates, were developed to define the role of oncogenic mutations and cell type on tumorigenesis in vivo. Unlike most established human glioblastoma cell line xenografts, injection of transformed GEM-derived cortical astrocytes into the brains of immune-competent littermates produced astrocytomas, including the most aggressive subtype, glioblastoma, that recapitulated the histopathological hallmarks of human astrocytomas, including diffuse invasion of normal brain parenchyma. Bioluminescence imaging of orthotopic allografts from transformed astrocytes engineered to express luciferase was utilized to monitor in vivo tumor growth over time. Thus, astrocytoma models using astrocytes and NSC harvested from GEM with conditional oncogenic alleles provide an integrated system to study the genetics and cell biology of astrocytoma pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo and may be useful in preclinical drug development for these devastating diseases.Neuroscience, Issue 90, astrocytoma, cortical astrocytes, genetically engineered mice, glioblastoma, neural stem cells, orthotopic allograft51763Play ButtonPaired Whole Cell Recordings in Organotypic Hippocampal SlicesAuthors: Chantelle Fourie, Marianna Kiraly, Daniel V. Madison, Johanna M. Montgomery. Institutions: University of Auckland, Stanford University.Pair recordings involve simultaneous whole cell patch clamp recordings from two synaptically connected neurons, enabling not only direct electrophysiological characterization of the synaptic connections between individual neurons, but also pharmacological manipulation of either the presynaptic or the postsynaptic neuron. When carried out in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, the probability that two neurons are synaptically connected is significantly increased. This preparation readily enables identification of cell types, and the neurons maintain their morphology and properties of synaptic function similar to that in native brain tissue. A major advantage of paired whole cell recordings is the highly precise information it can provide on the properties of synaptic transmission and plasticity that are not possible with other more crude techniques utilizing extracellular axonal stimulation. Paired whole cell recordings are often perceived as too challenging to perform. While there are challenging aspects to this technique, paired recordings can be performed by anyone trained in whole cell patch clamping provided specific hardware and methodological criteria are followed. The probability of attaining synaptically connected paired recordings significantly increases with healthy organotypic slices and stable micromanipulation allowing independent attainment of pre- and postsynaptic whole cell recordings. While CA3-CA3 pyramidal cell pairs are most widely used in the organotypic slice hippocampal preparation, this technique has also been successful in CA3-CA1 pairs and can be adapted to any neurons that are synaptically connected in the same slice preparation. In this manuscript we provide the detailed methodology and requirements for establishing this technique in any laboratory equipped for electrophysiology.Neuroscience, Issue 91, hippocampus, paired recording, whole cell recording, organotypic slice, synapse, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity51958Play ButtonImaging Intracellular Ca2+ Signals in Striatal Astrocytes from Adult Mice Using Genetically-encoded Calcium IndicatorsAuthors: Ruotian Jiang, Martin D. Haustein, Michael V. Sofroniew, Baljit S. Khakh. Institutions: University of California Los Angeles, University of California Los Angeles.Astrocytes display spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ concentration fluctuations ([Ca2+]i) and in several settings respond to neuronal excitation with enhanced [Ca2+]i signals. It has been proposed that astrocytes in turn regulate neurons and blood vessels through calcium-dependent mechanisms, such as the release of signaling molecules. However, [Ca2+]i imaging in entire astrocytes has only recently become feasible with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as the GCaMP series. The use of GECIs in astrocytes now provides opportunities to study astrocyte [Ca2+]i signals in detail within model microcircuits such as the striatum, which is the largest nucleus of the basal ganglia. In the present report, detailed surgical methods to express GECIs in astrocytes in vivo, and confocal imaging approaches to record [Ca2+]i signals in striatal astrocytes in situ, are described. We highlight precautions, necessary controls and tests to determine if GECI expression is selective for astrocytes and to evaluate signs of overt astrocyte reactivity. We also describe brain slice and imaging conditions in detail that permit reliable [Ca2+]i imaging in striatal astrocytes in situ. The use of these approaches revealed the entire territories of single striatal astrocytes and spontaneous [Ca2+]i signals within their somata, branches and branchlets. The further use and expansion of these approaches in the striatum will allow for the detailed study of astrocyte [Ca2+]i signals in the striatal microcircuitry.Neuroscience, Issue 93, astrocyte, calcium, striatum, GECI, GCaMP3, AAV2/5, stereotaxic injection, brain slice, imaging51972Play ButtonMethods to Assess Subcellular Compartments of Muscle in C. elegansAuthors: Christopher J. Gaffney, Joseph J. Bass, Thomas F. Barratt, Nathaniel J. Szewczyk. Institutions: University of Nottingham.Muscle is a dynamic tissue that responds to changes in nutrition, exercise, and disease state. The loss of muscle mass and function with disease and age are significant public health burdens. We currently understand little about the genetic regulation of muscle health with disease or age. The nematode C. elegans is an established model for understanding the genomic regulation of biological processes of interest. This worm’s body wall muscles display a large degree of homology with the muscles of higher metazoan species. Since C. elegans is a transparent organism, the localization of GFP to mitochondria and sarcomeres allows visualization of these structures in vivo. Similarly, feeding animals cationic dyes, which accumulate based on the existence of a mitochondrial membrane potential, allows the assessment of mitochondrial function in vivo. These methods, as well as assessment of muscle protein homeostasis, are combined with assessment of whole animal muscle function, in the form of movement assays, to allow correlation of sub-cellular defects with functional measures of muscle performance. Thus, C. elegans provides a powerful platform with which to assess the impact of mutations, gene knockdown, and/or chemical compounds upon muscle structure and function. Lastly, as GFP, cationic dyes, and movement assays are assessed non-invasively, prospective studies of muscle structure and function can be conducted across the whole life course and this at present cannot be easily investigated in vivo in any other organism.Developmental Biology, Issue 93, Physiology, C. elegans, muscle, mitochondria, sarcomeres, ageing52043Play ButtonImproved Preparation and Preservation of Hippocampal Mouse Slices for a Very Stable and Reproducible Recording of Long-term PotentiationAuthors: Agnès Villers, Laurence Ris. Institutions: University of Mons.Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a type of synaptic plasticity characterized by an increase in synaptic strength and believed to be involved in memory encoding. LTP elicited in the CA1 region of acute hippocampal slices has been extensively studied. However the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance phase of this phenomenon are still poorly understood. This could be partly due to the various experimental conditions used by different laboratories. Indeed, the maintenance phase of LTP is strongly dependent on external parameters like oxygenation, temperature and humidity. It is also dependent on internal parameters like orientation of the slicing plane and slice viability after dissection.
The optimization of all these parameters enables the induction of a very reproducible and very stable long-term potentiation. This methodology offers the possibility to further explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the stable increase in synaptic strength in hippocampal slices. It also highlights the importance of experimental conditions in in vitro investigation of neurophysiological phenomena.Neuroscience, Issue 76, Neurobiology, Anatomy, Physiology, Biomedical Engineering, Surgery, Memory Disorders, Learning, Memory, Neurosciences, Neurophysiology, hippocampus, long-term potentiation, mice, acute slices, synaptic plasticity, in vitro, electrophysiology, animal model50483Play ButtonIn Vivo Modeling of the Morbid Human Genome using Danio rerioAuthors: Adrienne R. Niederriter, Erica E. Davis, Christelle Golzio, Edwin C. Oh, I-Chun Tsai, Nicholas Katsanis. Institutions: Duke University Medical Center, Duke University, Duke University Medical Center.Here, we present methods for the development of assays to query potentially clinically significant nonsynonymous changes using in vivo complementation in zebrafish. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are a useful animal system due to their experimental tractability; embryos are transparent to enable facile viewing, undergo rapid development ex vivo, and can be genetically manipulated.1 These aspects have allowed for significant advances in the analysis of embryogenesis, molecular processes, and morphogenetic signaling. Taken together, the advantages of this vertebrate model make zebrafish highly amenable to modeling the developmental defects in pediatric disease, and in some cases, adult-onset disorders. Because the zebrafish genome is highly conserved with that of humans (~70% orthologous), it is possible to recapitulate human disease states in zebrafish. This is accomplished either through the injection of mutant human mRNA to induce dominant negative or gain of function alleles, or utilization of morpholino (MO) antisense oligonucleotides to suppress genes to mimic loss of function variants. Through complementation of MO-induced phenotypes with capped human mRNA, our approach enables the interpretation of the deleterious effect of mutations on human protein sequence based on the ability of mutant mRNA to rescue a measurable, physiologically relevant phenotype. Modeling of the human disease alleles occurs through microinjection of zebrafish embryos with MO and/or human mRNA at the 1-4 cell stage, and phenotyping up to seven days post fertilization (dpf). This general strategy can be extended to a wide range of disease phenotypes, as demonstrated in the following protocol. We present our established models for morphogenetic signaling, craniofacial, cardiac, vascular integrity, renal function, and skeletal muscle disorder phenotypes, as well as others.

Institutions: University of Wuerzburg, Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology, Martinsried, Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich.Visualization of calcium dynamics is important to understand the role of calcium in cell physiology. To examine calcium dynamics, synthetic fluorescent Ca2+ indictors have become popular. Here we demonstrate TED (= targeted-esterase induced dye loading), a method to improve the release of Ca2+ indicator dyes in the ER lumen of different cell types. To date, TED was used in cell lines, glial cells, and neurons in vitro. TED bases on efficient, recombinant targeting of a high carboxylesterase activity to the ER lumen using vector-constructs that express Carboxylesterases (CES). The latest TED vectors contain a core element of CES2 fused to a red fluorescent protein, thus enabling simultaneous two-color imaging. The dynamics of free calcium in the ER are imaged in one color, while the corresponding ER structure appears in red. At the beginning of the procedure, cells are transduced with a lentivirus. Subsequently, the infected cells are seeded on coverslips to finally enable live cell imaging. Then, living cells are incubated with the acetoxymethyl ester (AM-ester) form of low-affinity Ca2+ indicators, for instance Fluo5N-AM, Mag-Fluo4-AM, or Mag-Fura2-AM. The esterase activity in the ER cleaves off hydrophobic side chains from the AM form of the Ca2+ indicator and a hydrophilic fluorescent dye/Ca2+ complex is formed and trapped in the ER lumen. After dye loading, the cells are analyzed at an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope. Cells are continuously perfused with Ringer-like solutions and the ER calcium dynamics are directly visualized by time-lapse imaging. Calcium release from the ER is identified by a decrease in fluorescence intensity in regions of interest, whereas the refilling of the ER calcium store produces an increase in fluorescence intensity. Finally, the change in fluorescent intensity over time is determined by calculation of ΔF/F0.Cellular Biology, Issue 75, Neurobiology, Neuroscience, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, Biomedical Engineering, Bioengineering, Virology, Medicine, Anatomy, Physiology, Surgery, Endoplasmic Reticulum, ER, Calcium Signaling, calcium store, calcium imaging, calcium indicator, metabotropic signaling, Ca2+, neurons, cells, mouse, animal model, cell culture, targeted esterase induced dye loading, imaging50317Play ButtonPreparation of Dissociated Mouse Cortical Neuron CulturesAuthors: Lutz G. W. Hilgenberg, Martin A. Smith. Institutions: University of California, Irvine (UCI).This video will guide you through the process for generating cortical neuronal cultures from late embryo and early postnatal mouse brain. These cultures can be used for a variety of applications including immunocytochemistry, biochemistry, electrophysiology, calcium and sodium imaging, protein and/or RNA isolation. These cultures also provide a platform to study the neuronal development of transgenic animals that carry a late embryonic or postnatal lethal gene mutation. The procedure is relatively straight forward, requires some experience in tissue culture technique and should not take longer than two to three hours if you are properly prepared. Careful separation of the cortical rind from the thalamo-cortical fiber tract will reduce the number of unwanted non-neuronal cells. To increase yields of neuronal cells triturate the pieces of the cortical tissue gently after the enzyme incubation step. This is imperative as it prevents unnecessary injury to cells and premature neuronal cell death. Since these cultures are maintained in the absence of glia feeder cells, they also offer an added advantage of growing cultures enriched in neurons.Neuroscience, Issue 10, cellular, molecular, neurobiology, neuron, calcium/sodium imaging, primary cultures, mouse562Play ButtonAnalysis of Schwann-astrocyte Interactions Using In Vitro AssaysAuthors: Fardad T. Afshari, Jessica C. Kwok, James W. Fawcett. Institutions: University of Cambridge.Schwann cells are one of the commonly used cells in repair strategies following spinal cord injuries. Schwann cells are capable of supporting axonal regeneration and sprouting by secreting growth factors 1,2 and providing growth promoting adhesion molecules 3 and extracellular matrix molecules 4. In addition they myelinate the demyelinated axons at the site of injury 5.
However following transplantation, Schwann cells do not migrate from the site of implant and do not intermingle with the host astrocytes 6,7. This results in formation of a sharp boundary between the Schwann cells and astrocytes, creating an obstacle for growing axons trying to exit the graft back into the host tissue proximally and distally. Astrocytes in contact with Schwann cells also undergo hypertrophy and up-regulate the inhibitory molecules 8-13.
In vitro assays have been used to model Schwann cell-astrocyte interactions and have been important in understanding the mechanism underlying the cellular behaviour.
These in vitro assays include boundary assay, where a co-culture is made using two different cells with each cell type occupying different territories with only a small gap separating the two cell fronts. As the cells divide and migrate, the two cellular fronts get closer to each other and finally collide. This allows the behaviour of the two cellular populations to be analyzed at the boundary. Another variation of the same technique is to mix the two cellular populations in culture and over time the two cell types segregate with Schwann cells clumped together as islands in between astrocytes together creating multiple Schwann-astrocyte boundaries.
The second assay used in studying the interaction of two cell types is the migration assay where cellular movement can be tracked on the surface of the other cell type monolayer 14,15. This assay is commonly known as inverted coverslip assay. Schwann cells are cultured on small glass fragments and they are inverted face down onto the surface of astrocyte monolayers and migration is assessed from the edge of coverslip.
Both assays have been instrumental in studying the underlying mechanisms involved in the cellular exclusion and boundary formation. Some of the molecules identified using these techniques include N-Cadherins 15, Chondroitin Sulphate proteoglycans(CSPGs) 16,17, FGF/Heparin 18, Eph/Ephrins19.
This article intends to describe boundary assay and migration assay in stepwise fashion and elucidate the possible technical problems that might occur.Cellular Biology, Issue 47, Schwann cell, astrocyte, boundary, migration, repulsion2214Play ButtonQuantifying Synapses: an Immunocytochemistry-based Assay to Quantify Synapse NumberAuthors: Dominic M. Ippolito, Cagla Eroglu. Institutions: Duke University, Duke University.One of the most important goals in neuroscience is to understand the molecular cues that instruct early stages of synapse formation. As such it has become imperative to develop objective approaches to quantify changes in synaptic connectivity. Starting from sample fixation, this protocol details how to quantify synapse number both in dissociated neuronal culture and in brain sections using immunocytochemistry. Using compartment-specific antibodies, we label presynaptic terminals as well as sites of postsynaptic specialization. We define synapses as points of colocalization between the signals generated by these markers. The number of these colocalizations is quantified using a plug in Puncta Analyzer (written by Bary Wark, available upon request, c.eroglu@cellbio.duke.edu) under the ImageJ analysis software platform. The synapse assay described in this protocol can be applied to any neural tissue or culture preparation for which you have selective pre- and postsynaptic markers. This synapse assay is a valuable tool that can be widely utilized in the study of synaptic development.Neuroscience, Issue 45, synapse, immunocytochemistry, brain, neuron, astrocyte2270Play ButtonPreparation of Acute Hippocampal Slices from Rats and Transgenic Mice for the Study of Synaptic Alterations during Aging and Amyloid PathologyAuthors: Diana M. Mathis, Jennifer L. Furman, Christopher M. Norris. Institutions: University of Kentucky College of Public Health, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, University of Kentucky College of Medicine.The rodent hippocampal slice preparation is perhaps the most broadly used tool for investigating mammalian synaptic function and plasticity. The hippocampus can be extracted quickly and easily from rats and mice and slices remain viable for hours in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, basic electrophysisologic techniques are easily applied to the investigation of synaptic function in hippocampal slices and have provided some of the best biomarkers for cognitive impairments. The hippocampal slice is especially popular for the study of synaptic plasticity mechanisms involved in learning and memory. Changes in the induction of long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD) of synaptic efficacy in hippocampal slices (or lack thereof) are frequently used to describe the neurologic phenotype of cognitively-impaired animals and/or to evaluate the mechanism of action of nootropic compounds. This article outlines the procedures we use for preparing hippocampal slices from rats and transgenic mice for the study of synaptic alterations associated with brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD)1-3. Use of aged rats and AD model mice can present a unique set of challenges to researchers accustomed to using younger rats and/or mice in their research. Aged rats have thicker skulls and tougher connective tissue than younger rats and mice, which can delay brain extraction and/or dissection and consequently negate or exaggerate real age-differences in synaptic function and plasticity. Aging and amyloid pathology may also exacerbate hippocampal damage sustained during the dissection procedure, again complicating any inferences drawn from physiologic assessment. Here, we discuss the steps taken during the dissection procedure to minimize these problems. Examples of synaptic responses acquired in ""healthy"" and ""unhealthy"" slices from rats and mice are provided, as well as representative synaptic plasticity experiments. The possible impact of other methodological factors on synaptic function in these animal models (e.g. recording solution components, stimulation parameters) are also discussed. While the focus of this article is on the use of aged rats and transgenic mice, novices to slice physiology should find enough detail here to get started on their own studies, using a variety of rodent models.Neuroscience, Issue 49, aging, amyloid, hippocampal slice, synaptic plasticity, Ca2+, CA1, electrophysiology2330Play ButtonMesenteric Artery Contraction and Relaxation Studies Using Automated Wire MyographyAuthors: Lakeesha E. Bridges, Cicely L. Williams, Mildred A. Pointer, Emmanuel M. Awumey. Institutions: North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina Central University, Durham, Wake Forest University School of Medicine.Proximal resistance vessels, such as the mesenteric arteries, contribute substantially to the peripheral resistance. These small vessels of between 100-400 μm in diameter function primarily in directing blood flow to various organs according to the overall requirements of the body. The rat mesenteric artery has a diameter greater than 100 μm. The myography technique, first described by Mulvay and Halpern1, was based on the method proposed by Bevan and Osher2. The technique provides information about small vessels under isometric conditions, where substantial shortening of the muscle preparation is prevented. Since force production and sensitivity of vessels to different agonists is dependent on the extent of stretch, according to active tension-length relation, it is essential to conduct contraction studies under isometric conditions to prevent compliance of the mounting wires. Stainless steel wires are preferred to tungsten wires because of oxidation of the latter, which affects recorded responses3.The technique allows for the comparison of agonist-induced contractions of mounted vessels to obtain evidence for normal function of vascular smooth muscle cell receptors.

Haas, Hendrik Wildner, Roberta Azzarelli, Donald M. Bell, Djoher Nora Abrous, François Guillemot. Institutions: MRC National Institute for Medical Research, National Institute for Medical Research, Université de Bordeaux.In utero electroporation (IUE) has become a powerful technique to study the development of different regions of the embryonic nervous system 1-5. To date this tool has been widely used to study the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation and neuronal migration especially in the developing cerebral cortex 6-8. Here we detail our protocol to electroporate in utero the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus and provide evidence that this approach can be used to study dendrites and spines in these two cerebral regions.
Finally, IUE provides a useful tool to identify functional interactions between genes involved in dendrite, spine and/or synapse development. Indeed, in contrast to other gene transfer methods such as virus, it is straightforward to combine multiple RNAi or transgenes in the same population of cells. In summary, IUE is a powerful method that has already contributed to the characterization of molecular mechanisms underlying brain function and disease and it should also be useful in the study of dendrites and spines.Neuroscience, Issue 65, Developmental Biology, Molecular Biology, Neuronal development, In utero electroporation, dendrite, spines, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, gain and loss of function4163Play ButtonImaging Analysis of Neuron to Glia Interaction in Microfluidic Culture Platform (MCP)-based Neuronal Axon and Glia Co-culture SystemAuthors: Haruki Higashimori, Yongjie Yang. Institutions: Tufts University, Tufts Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences.Proper neuron to glia interaction is critical to physiological function of the central nervous system (CNS). This bidirectional communication is sophisticatedly mediated by specific signaling pathways between neuron and glia1,2 . Identification and characterization of these signaling pathways is essential to the understanding of how neuron to glia interaction shapes CNS physiology. Previously, neuron and glia mixed cultures have been widely utilized for testing and characterizing signaling pathways between neuron and glia. What we have learned from these preparations and other in vivo tools, however, has suggested that mutual signaling between neuron and glia often occurred in specific compartments within neurons (i.e., axon, dendrite, or soma)3. This makes it important to develop a new culture system that allows separation of neuronal compartments and specifically examines the interaction between glia and neuronal axons/dendrites. In addition, the conventional mixed culture system is not capable of differentiating the soluble factors and direct membrane contact signals between neuron and glia. Furthermore, the large quantity of neurons and glial cells in the conventional co-culture system lacks the resolution necessary to observe the interaction between a single axon and a glial cell.
In this study, we describe a novel axon and glia co-culture system with the use of a microfluidic culture platform (MCP). In this co-culture system, neurons and glial cells are cultured in two separate chambers that are connected through multiple central channels. In this microfluidic culture platform, only neuronal processes (especially axons) can enter the glial side through the central channels. In combination with powerful fluorescent protein labeling, this system allows direct examination of signaling pathways between axonal/dendritic and glial interactions, such as axon-mediated transcriptional regulation in glia, glia-mediated receptor trafficking in neuronal terminals, and glia-mediated axon growth. The narrow diameter of the chamber also significantly prohibits the flow of the neuron-enriched medium into the glial chamber, facilitating probing of the direct membrane-protein interaction between axons/dendrites and glial surfaces.Neuroscience, Issue 68, Molecular Biology, Cellular Biology, Biophysics, Microfluidics, Microfluidic culture platform, Compartmented culture, Neuron to glia signaling, neurons, glia, cell culture4448Play ButtonFluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) of Fluorescence Tagged Proteins in Dendritic Spines of Cultured Hippocampal NeuronsAuthors: Chan-Ying Zheng, Ronald S. Petralia, Ya-Xian Wang, Bechara Kachar. Institutions: National Institutes of Health, Bethesda.FRAP has been used to quantify the mobility of GFP-tagged proteins. Using a strong excitation laser, the fluorescence of a GFP-tagged protein is bleached in the region of interest. The fluorescence of the region recovers when the unbleached GFP-tagged protein from outside of the region diffuses into the region of interest. The mobility of the protein is then analyzed by measuring the fluorescence recovery rate. This technique could be used to characterize protein mobility and turnover rate.
This FRAP protocol shows how to perform a basic FRAP experiment as well as how to analyze the data.Neuroscience, Issue 50, Spine, FRAP, hippocampal neurons, live cell imaging, protein mobility2568Play ButtonPrimary Neuronal Cultures from the Brains of Late Stage Drosophila PupaeAuthors: Beatriz Sicaeros, Jorge M. Campusano, Diane K. O'Dowd. Institutions: University of California, Irvine (UCI).In this video, we demonstrate the preparation of primary neuronal cultures from the brains of late stage Drosophila pupae. The procedure begins with the removal of brains from animals at 70-78 hrs after puparium formation. The isolated brains are shown after brief incubation in papain followed by several washes in serum-free growth medium. The process of mechanical dissociation of each brain in a 5 ul drop of media on a coverslip is illustrated. The axons and dendrites of the post-mitotic neurons are sheered off near the soma during dissociation but the neurons begin to regenerate processes within a few hours of plating. Images show live cultures at 2 days. Neurons continue to elaborate processes during the first week in culture. Specific neuronal populations can be identified in culture using GAL4 lines to drive tissue specific expression of fluorescent markers such as GFP or RFP. Whole cell recordings have demonstrated the cultured neurons form functional, spontaneously active cholinergic and GABAergic synapses. A short video segment illustrates calcium dynamics in the cultured neurons using Fura-2 as a calcium indicator dye to monitor spontaneous calcium transients and nicotine evoked calcium responses in a dish of cultured neurons. These pupal brain cultures are a useful model system in which genetic and pharmacological tools can be used to identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence formation and function of central synapses.",['They are rich in actin and have been shown to be highly dynamic.'],6654,multifieldqa_en,en,,4214e20df9d299bae4fb9ba8d1b4792d516812e86960009c," Astrocytes are an abundant cell type in the mammalian brain. In vitro astrocyte cell culture systems can be used to study the biological functions of these glial cells in detail. This video protocol shows how to obtain pure astro Cytes by isolation and culture of mixed cortical cells of mouse pups. The method is based on the absence of viable neurons and the separation of astroCytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia, the three main glial cell populations of the central nervous system, in culture. The images during the first days of culture demonstrate the presence of a mixed cell population and indicate the timepoint, when astro cytes become confluent and should be separated frommicroglia and oligod endrocyts. The video protocol also shows the purity and astrotytic morphology of cultured astropytes using immunocytochemical stainin. The results of the study were published in the journal of the University of Freiburg, the German Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Dendritic spines are protrusions emerging from the dendrite of a neuron and represent the primary postsynaptic targets of excitatory inputs in the brain. The quantitative analysis of spine morphology using light microscopy remains an essential problem due to technical limitations associated with light's intrinsic refraction limit. The blood brain barrier (BBB) specifically regulates molecular and cellular flux between the blood and the nervous tissue. The aim was to develop and characterize a highly reproducible rat syngeneic in vitro model of the BBB using co-cultures of primary rat brain endothelial cells (RBEC) and astrocytes to study receptors involved in transcytosis across the endothelial cell monolayer. This culture system can be easily used to obtain pure mouse astroCytes and astracyte-conditioned medium for studying various aspects of astro Cyte biology. It can also be used to study well established and newly described astro cyte markers. It was developed by researchers at the University of Amsterdam and the VECT-HORUS SAS. The ability of astrocytic receptors to exhibit plasticity in response to changes in neuronal activity has received little attention. Having an understanding of how astroCytic receptor signaling is affected by changes in. neuronal activity could have important implications for both normal. synaptic function as well as processes underlying neurological disorders and. neurodegenerative disease.

The technique could be used to globally scale up or down astrocyclic group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in acute brain slices. It could also be used in the central nervous system to regulate the spatio-temporal dynamics and co-o-temporo- temporal dynamics of neurons. It was developed by Alison X. Xie, Kelli Lauderdale, Thomas Murphy, Timothy L. Myers, Todd A. Fiacco at University of California Riverside. dination of neuronal networks. In the mammalian cortex, neurons form extremely complicated networks and exchange information at synapses. Changes in synaptic strength, as well as addition/removal of synapses, occur in an experience-dependent manner, providing the structural foundation of neuronal plasticity. As postsynaptic components of the most excitatory synapses in the cortex, dendritic spines are considered to be a good proxy ofsynapses. Two-photon in vivo imaging of Dendritic Spines in the Mouse Cortex Using a Thinned-skull Preparation. Using Cortical Astrocytes or Neural Stem Cells from Conditional, Genetically Engineered Mice. The experimental procedure can be performed repetitively over various time intervals ranging from hours to years. The application of this preparation can also be expanded to investigate different cortical regions and layers, aswell as other cell types, under physiological and pathological conditions. The results indicate that various GABAAR subtypes differ in their ability to promote synapse formation, suggesting that this reduced in vitro model system can be used to reproduce, at least in part, the in vivo conditions. Current astrocytoma models are limited in their ability to define the roles of oncogenic mutations in specific brain cell types during disease pathogenesis. In order to design a better model system, cells from genetically engineered mice were harvested and grown in culture. The phenotypic consequences of these mutations were defined by measuring proliferation, transformation, and drug response in vitro. Paired whole cell recordings are often perceived as too challenging to perform, but can be performed by anyone trained in whole cell patch clamping. The probability of attaining synaptically connected paired recordings significantly increases with healthy organotypic slices of the brain, according to the authors of the study. It can provide information on the properties of synaptic transmission and plasticity that is not possible with other more crude techniques utilizing extracellular axonal stimulation. The study was published in the journal Neuroscience. It was co-authored by Chantelle Fourie, Marianna Kiraly, Daniel V. Madison, Johanna M. Montgomery, and Kristen White. Astrocytes display spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ concentration fluctuations. Using genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as the GCaMP series, scientists can study astrocyte [Ca2+]i signals in detail within model microcircuits. C. elegans is an established model for understanding the genomic regulation of biological processes of interest. The worm’s body wall muscles display a large degree of homology with the muscles of higher metazoan species. The localization of GFP to mitochondria and sarcomeres allows visualization of these structures in vivo. The further use and expansion of these approaches in the striatum will allow for the detailed study of the striatal microcircuitry. The loss of muscle mass and function with disease and age are significant public health burdens. We currently understand little about the genetic regulation of muscle health with disease or age. These methods, as well as assessment of muscle protein homeostasis, are combined with assessment of whole animal muscle function, to allow the correlation of sub-cellular defects with functional measures of muscle performance. mpact of mutations, gene knockdown, and/or chemical compounds upon muscle structure and function. As GFP, cationic dyes, and movement assays are assessed non-invasively, prospective studies of muscle structure can be conducted across the whole life course and this at present cannot be easily investigated in vivo in any other organism. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are a useful animal system due to their experimental tractability. They are transparent to enable facile viewing, undergo rapid development ex vivo, and can be genetically manipulated. Taken together, the advantages of this vertebrate model make zebrafish highly amenable to modeling the developmental defects in pediatric disease, and in some cases, adult-onset disorders. Because the zebra fish genome is highly conserved with that of humans (~70% orthologous), it is possible to recapitulate human disease states inZebrafish. This is accomplished through the injection of mutant human mRNA to induce dominant negative or gain of function alleles, or utilization of morpholino (MO) antisense oligonucleotides to suppress genes to mimic loss of function variants. This video will guide you through the process for generating cortical neuronal cultures from late embryo and early postnatal mouse brain. The cultures can be used for a variety of applications including immunocytochemistry, biochemistry, electrophysiology, calcium and sodium imaging, protein and/or RNA isolation. These cultures also provide a platform to study the neuronal development of transgenic animals that carry a late embryonic or postnatal lethal gene mutation. The procedure is relatively straight forward, requires some separation of the cortical rind from the cortical tissue, and should not take longer than two to three hours if you are properly prepared.s demonstrated in the following protocol. We present our established models for morphogenetic signaling, craniofacial, cardiac, vascular integrity, renal function, and skeletal muscle disorder phenotypes, as well as others. For more information, visit the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology, Martinsried (Max Planck) (http://www.maxplanck.org/neurobiology/neuronal-development/neuron-development-neurons-and-mammoth-cortical-tissue-cultures.html). lamo-cortical fiber tract will reduce the number of unwanted non-neuronal cells. To increase yields of neuronal cells triturate the pieces of the cortical tissue gently after the enzyme incubation step. This is imperative as it prevents unnecessary injury to cells and premature neuronal cell death. Since these cultures are maintained in the absence of glia feeder cells, they also offer an added advantage of growing cultures enriched in neurons. In vitro assays have been used to model Schwann cell-astrocyte interactions and have been important in understanding the mechanism underlying the cellular behaviour. Some of the molecules identified using these techniques include N-Cadherins 15, Chondroitin Sulphate proteoglycans(CSPGs) 16,17, FGF/Heparin 18, Eph/Ephrins19. This article intends to describe boundary assay and migration assay in stepwise fashion and elucidate the possible technical problems that might occur. Starting from sample fixation, this protocol details how to quantify synapse number both in dissociated neuronal culture and in brain sections using immunocytochemistry. This article outlines the procedures we use for preparing hippocampal slices from rats and transgenic mice for the study of synaptic alterations associated with brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD)1-3. Use of aged rats and AD model mice can present a unique set of challenges to researchers accustomed to using younger rats and/or mice in their research. Proximal resistance vessels, such as the mesenteric arteries, contribute substantially to the peripheral resistance. These small vessels of bet bettered betterness can be used to study the effects of stress on the cardiovascular system on the brain and nervous system. This article is a valuable tool that can be widely utilized in theStudy of synaptic development. The synapse assay described in this protocol can be applied to any neural tissue or culture preparation for which you have selective pre- and postsynaptic markers. The number of these colocalizations is quantified using a plug in Puncta Analyzer (written by Bary Wark, available upon request, c.eroglu@cellbio.duke.edu) under the ImageJ analysis platform. In utero electroporation (IUE) has become a powerful technique to study the development of different regions of the embryonic nervous system. IUE provides a useful tool to identify functional interactions between genes involved in dendrite, spine and/or synapse development. In contrast to other gene transfer methods such as virus, it is straightforward to combine multiple RNAi or transgenes in the same population of cells. In summary, IUE is a powerful method that has already contributed to the characterization of molecular mechanisms underlying brain function and disease and it should also be useful in the study of dendrites and spines. It is important to develop a new culture system that allows separation of neuronal compartments and specifically examines the interaction between glia and neuronal axons/dendrites. Back to Mail Online home. Back To the page you came from. READ: In utero Electroporation, we electroporate in utero the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus and provide evidence that this approach can be used to study d Endrites and Spines in these two cerebral regions. The conventional mixed culture system is not capable of differentiating the soluble factors and direct membrane contact signals between neuron and glia. In this microfluidic culture platform, only neuronal processes (especially axons) can enter the glial side through the central channels. This system allows direct examination of signaling pathways between axonal/dendritic and glial interactions, such as axon-mediated transcriptional regulation in glia, glia-mediated receptor trafficking in neuronal terminals, and gla-mediated axon growth. This video shows the preparation of primary neuronal cultures from the brains of late stage Drosophila pupae. The procedure begins with the removal of brains from animals at 70-78 hrs after puparium formation. The isolated brains are shown after brief incubation in papain followed by several washes in serum-free growth medium. The process of mechanical dissociation of each brain in a 5 ul drop of media on a coverslip is illustrated. The axons and dendrites of the post-mitotic neurons are sheered off near the soma during dissociation. ic and pharmacological tools can be used to identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence formation and function of central synapses."
How many people attend the 233rd ACS national meeting?,"The major actions taken by the board of directors and council during the national meeting in Chicago were reported in C&EN, April 30 (page 32).
The Society Committee on Budget & Finance met on Saturday, March 24, to review the society's 2006 financial performance. The society ended 2006 with a net contribution from operations of $12.2 million, on revenues of $424.0 million and expenses of $411.8 million. This was $7.8 million favorable to the approved budget.
After including the results of the Member Insurance Program and new ventures, the society's overall net contribution for 2006 was $11.5 million, which was $7.4 million favorable to the approved budget. The favorable variance was primarily attributable to higher than budgeted electronic services revenue and investment income, as well as expense savings from lower than budgeted health care costs and reduced IT spending. In addition, the society ended the year in compliance with the board-established financial guidelines.
The Society Committee on Education (SOCED) received an update from President Catherine Hunt on the thematic programming featured in Chicago focusing on the sustainability of energy, food, and water. President-Elect Bruce Bursten solicited input from the committee pertaining to the central role of education in his agenda. SOCED received a presentation from the Membership Affairs Committee on its white paper on membership requirements.

SOCED received an update from the Committee on Professional Training regarding the draft ACS guidelines for approval of bachelor's degree programs in chemistry.
Committee members discussed the report prepared by the Globalization Task Force, focusing on those sections relevant to education. The committee suggested initiatives related to the new ACS strategic plan, including a potential program that would engage retired chemists in the K-12 classroom. SOCED created a task force to consider the role of online, or ""virtual,"" simulations in the chemistry laboratory, recognizing the value of online/virtual experiences as a supplement to, but not a replacement for, hands-on laboratory experiments.
The committee ratified two interim actions taken since the Dec. 3, 2006, meeting: to remove the financial restriction of the ACS Petroleum Research Fund (ACS PRF) Supplement for Underrepresented Minority Research Programs (SUMR) and to contact nominators whose nominations for the Volunteer Service Award had expired and to invite them to reactivate their nomination packet for the 2008 Volunteer Service Award.
Acting under delegated authority, the committee voted to accept the recommendations of the ACS Petroleum Research Fund Advisory Board (February 2007 meeting) for funding grants totaling $5.2 million; voted to recommend to the board a screened list of six nominees (due to a two-way tie for fifth place) for the 2008 Priestley Medal; voted to recommend to the board a screened list of five nominees for the 2008 Award for Volunteer Service to ACS; on the recommendation of the ACS Committee on Frasch Foundation Grants, voted to recommend to the board that it recommend to the trustee (US Trust) of the Frasch Foundation 12 grants for research in agricultural chemistry for the period of 2007–12; voted to recommend to the ACS Board of Directors that a new national award be established, the ""ACS Award for Affordable Green Chemistry,"" sponsored by Rohm and Haas; and voted to recommend to the ACS Board of Directors that a new endowment be established, the ""Affordable Green Chemistry Endowment Fund,"" to support the award.
The committee also reviewed the final report from the Special Board Task Force on the Review of the ACS National Awards Program, chaired by Ronald Breslow; established a Canvassing & Selection Subcommittee; and reviewed a list of external awards for which ACS may want to nominate candidates. The committee agreed to include the list of significant external awards in the awards locator database that is being developed.
The committee was updated on efforts to reconcile ACS's technical divisions' desires to leverage national meeting content using the Internet with our journal editors' concerns about prior publication issues. A conference call on this issue was scheduled for April 21, 2007.
The committee received a presentation on the recent actions of the ACS Board of Directors International Strategy Group (ISG). The group's charge is to develop recommendations for a short- and long-term international strategy for the society.
The committee was updated on the status of the activities of the Board Oversight Group on Leadership Development (BOG). Potential solutions for the unexpectedly high cost of facilitator training and transitioning from the current Leaders Conference format to the newly designed curriculum were presented to the committee.
The committee reviewed plans for conducting the 2007 Membership Satisfaction Survey. Preliminary results are expected in May or June with a final report to be delivered to the board at the 2007 Boston national meeting.
The committee received a briefing on the status of the MORE Project: Multidisciplinary Opportunities though Resource Enhancement. Twenty-eight proposals were received, and a decision on which proposals to support will be made in early May.
The chair led a discussion on draft 2007 committee goals, and committee members offered several suggestions related to successfully meeting them. One suggestion was to modify a communications goal to make it more completely reflect the duties of the committee outlined in the board regulations. The chair and committee members will examine the suggestion and revisit the question after the board retreat where board committee duties will be examined.
ACS President Hunt discussed her 2007-08 Presidential Task Force on Enhancing Science & Technology, which is charged with developing advocacy best practices that can enhance ACS's attainment of its public policy priorities. The task force is composed of a diverse set of ACS members as well as former U.S. Representative and chairman of the House Science Committee, Sherwood Boehlert, who will cochair the task force.
• Results of the 2007 Public Policy Priorities Survey, which resulted in a four-tiered ranking of ACS's 2007 public policies. The ranking will help focus staff resources in conducting outreach and advocacy on behalf of ACS members.
• The hiring of a communications consulting firm for 2007 to assist ACS in implementing the initial phase of the ACS Strategic Communications Plan.
• Creation of a pilot ACS state government affairs advocacy program. Committee members agreed to the creation of a pilot, and staff will propose an initial list of states, policy focus, and a budget to carry out the program.
The committee met in executive session on March 23 and in open session jointly with the Joint Board-Council Committee on Publications and the Division of Chemical Information on March 26.
The committee heard from Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) management on a range of issues including a report on continuing database building efforts, product enhancements, and CAS's centennial celebration plans.
The Committee on Chemical Safety (CCS) provides advice on the handling of chemicals and seeks to ensure safe facilities, designs, and operations by calling attention to potential hazards and stimulating education in safe practices.
CCS has several publications (many downloadable), including the flagship publication, ""Safety in Academic Chemistry Labs"" (SACL). Work has recently started on the translation of SACL into Arabic. This is in addition to the online Spanish version of SACL. Also online are the ""Student Lab Code of Conduct for Secondary Science Programs"" and a security vulnerability analysis checklist. A K-12 restricted hazardous substances list is under development. The third edition of the ""Chemical Safety Manual for Small Businesses"" will be ready soon.
The committee's Task Force on Laboratory Environment, Health & Safety is working on a new edition of ""Laboratory Waste Management.""

Our Video Safety Resources Task Force is developing video resources to be distributed over the Web.
CCS has been involved in collaborations for the updating of publications like ""Prudent Practices in the Laboratory"" and ""ACS Guidelines for the Teaching of High School Chemistry."" Along with other ACS units, CCS is exploring participating in the EPA's School Chemicals Cleanout Campaign.
The Committee on Chemists with Disabilities (CWD) met at the 233rd ACS national meeting, Chicago, on Monday, March 26. Judy Summers-Gates reported on the Joint Subcommittee on Diversity meeting. This subcommittee is made up of representatives of the five committees that support people in chemistry (as opposed to a category of the profession): CWD, Committee on Minority Affairs, Committee on Technician Affairs, Women Chemists Committee, and Younger Chemists Committee, and its goal is to develop ways to coordinate the efforts of the five groups.
The CWD Ambassador Program that was announced at CWD's 25th anniversary celebration at the Washington, D.C., meeting was discussed. Zelda Wasserman reported on the status of the letter from CWD to the ACS Board regarding captioning of ACS video materials. Janelle Kasper-Wolf, of ACS staff, discussed adding new questions to the ACS annual employment salary survey to obtain information for the committee.
At the Chicago national meeting, the Committee on Community Activities (CCA) partnered with the ACS Education Division and the Office of the President to host ""Chemistry In Action—It's Easy Being Green"" at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum on Saturday, March 24. More than 250 children participated in the hands-on activities focused on recycling. ACS President Hunt presented a Salutes to Excellence plaque to the museum for its dedication to community outreach.
The Chemists Celebrate Earth Day celebration occurred in 120 local sections with 138 coordinators leading the efforts within their communities. This represents an increase of more than 30% in local section and coordinator participation from 2006.
CCA was featured in C&EN's April 16th issue on page 53. A shortcut to CCA's homepage was created: chemistry.org/committees/cca.html.
During the Boston national meeting, CCA and the Office of Community Activities will celebrate National Chemistry Week's 20th Anniversary and its theme, ""The Many Faces of Chemistry."" A special outreach event is being planned for Sunday, Aug. 19. Hands-on activities will focus on health and wellness.
The Committee on Corporation Associates (CCA) advises and influences ACS to ensure that its products and services are of value to industrial members and their companies. CCA vice chair, Roslyn White (SC Johnson), provided an overview of recent interactions between Corporation Associates and the U.K.-based Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).
CCA gave feedback to a recommendations report from the ACS Board Committee on Professional & Member Relations Task Force on Globalization. Presentations were also received from the ACS Green Chemistry Institute and SCI.

Funding was provided to the following: The Committee on Economic & Professional Affairs at $3,000 for the Chicago symposium on ""Benefits Trends for the Chemical Workforce"" and the Office of Graduate Education and the Department of Career Development & Management at $4,500 for a workshop on ""Preparing for Life after Graduate School,"" to be held in conjunction with the 39th Central Regional Meeting.
The subcommittee also requested that ACS staff provide CCA with an official annual statement of Corporation Associates' financial reserves as of Jan. 1 of each year.
The Programs Subcommittee reported on planned programming activities in 2007 and beyond between CCA and SCI. The subcommittee gave an update on a Boston symposium cosponsored by Corporation Associates and the Medicinal Chemistry Division featuring past ACS Heroes of Chemistry from the pharmaceutical industry.
By request of the subcommittee, representatives from Chemical Abstracts Service gave an overview on AnaVist—a tool with potential applications for CCA's efforts to provide member companies with industry-relevant information and reports. The subcommittee also requested that CCA earmark approximately $20,000 of Corporation Associates funds in 2008 for its activities.
The Educational Outreach Subcommittee reported on its decision to collaborate with the Graduate Student Symposium Programming Committee of the Chemical Education Division on a graduate student industry roundtable program in Boston.
The subcommittee requested $5,000 in support of this effort. The subcommittee also discussed a request for corporate executive support of an American Association of Physics Teachers initiative to promote undergraduate research.
The Committee on Environmental Improvement (CEI) continues to be focused on the sustainability of the chemical enterprise. In Chicago, the committee introduced a multiyear effort to make ACS meetings more sustainable. This effort is designed to take advantage of the large size and diverse programs of the society to lead in the sustainability arena by ""walking the talk.""
The committee held a dialogue with representatives of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency who are trying to ""green"" federal conferences and work with the travel and tourism industry to change practices and shrink the environmental footprint of meetings. The committee also used advertising and student volunteers to engage individual meeting participants in a campaign to increase recycling by asking ""Are you sustainable?"" Moving forward, CEI looks forward to working closely with the Committee on Meetings & Expositions to advance this agenda.
CEI was also pleased to participate in the meeting theme on sustainability through the ACS presidential programming. CEI cohosted the Monday presidential luncheon to discuss sustainability issues with the Committee on Science and is leading the follow-up to that luncheon, which will include recommendations on advancing sustainability in the three focal areas of the meeting—energy, food, and water.
The committee also continued its dialogue with the Committee on Corporation Associates about a collaborative workshop. This activity, tentatively slated for the New Orleans meeting, will seek additional insights from chemical and allied products companies about public policy barriers that limit adoption of more sustainable products and practices as well as policy incentives that would lead to increased sustainability in the chemical enterprise.
At its Chicago meeting, the committee welcomed the president of the Jordanian Chemical Society and the past-president of the Arab Union of Chemists.
The committee was briefed on Pittcon 2007, where, with financial support from the Society of Analytical Chemists of Pittsburgh, ACS coordinated participation of a scientific delegation from Adriatic nations.
The committee heard reports on the 2007 Frontiers of Chemical Science III: Research & Education in the Middle East meeting; the 2007 Transatlantic Frontiers of Chemistry meeting, which was jointly sponsored by ACS, the German Chemical Society, and the Royal Society of Chemistry; planned workshops to engage U.S. and Chinese early-career scientists in chemical biology, supramolecular, and new materials chemistry; and ACS Discovery Corps U.S./Brazil Research Collaboration Project in Biomass Conversion to Biofuels, Biomaterials & Chemicals.

The committee heard reports on letter-writing efforts by the ACS president to government officials in Libya and Mexico expressing concerns about challenges to the scientific freedom and human rights of scientists there.
The Committee on Minority Affairs (CMA) approved new vision, mission, and values statements at the Chicago national meeting. The mission of CMA is to increase the participation of minority chemical scientists and influence policy on behalf of minorities in ACS and the chemical enterprise.
An aggressive new strategic plan was approved by CMA to guide its activities over the next three years. By the end of 2009, CMA will increase the number of ACS Scholars that graduate to 100 per year, add 100 new minorities to leadership positions in ACS, engage in several collaborations, and increase the number of minority members of ACS by 5,000. CMA will focus initially on increasing minorities in ACS leadership. In working toward this goal, CMA began work on two new leadership-development programs for minority chemists.
CMA continues to support the work of the Joint Subcommittee on Diversity (JSD) in developing programs, products, and services to ensure full participation of all members in ACS. In Chicago, JSD premiered a diversity booth at the meeting exposition hall and cosponsored symposia.
The Committee on Patents & Related Matters (CPRM) discussed proposed legislative and regulatory changes to the U.S. patent system as well as open-access legislation and the potential effects such matters might have on industry and academia as well as on ACS.
CPRM also continued its work on several new educational tools to assist and inform members on patent issues and other intellectual property matters important to a successful career in the chemical enterprise. Many of these tools are now available on the committee's expanded website, membership.acs.org/C/CPRM/.
At the March 2007 meeting, the Committee on Professional Training (CPT) reviewed 42 new and additional information reports from ACS-approved chemistry programs. CPT held conferences with four schools seeking approval, discussed three updates and five site visit reports, and approved three new schools. The total number of ACS-approved chemistry programs is now 642.
The committee released the full draft of the ACS guidelines for review and comment. Copies of the draft were distributed to the department chairs at all ACS-approved schools, the chairs of all ACS committees, and the chairs of all ACS technical divisions.
Several CPT members met with the ACS technical divisions during the Chicago meeting to present an overview of the draft and obtain feedback. The draft guidelines document is available on the CPT website, and the committee invites any comments to be sent to cpt@acs.org.
In other business, the committee continued development of the two workshops with minority-serving institutions that will be held in 2007. The committee reviewed the editorial policies for the 2007 edition of the ACS Directory of Graduate Research, which is using a new protocol for retrieving research publication titles in an effort to improve the accuracy of the directory.
C&EN finished 2006 with an exceptionally strong editorial package. The first months of 2007 are proving to be equally successful in fulfilling the magazine's mission of keeping its readers informed. On the advertising side, revenues in 2006 increased for the second year in a row, and the early months of 2007 show continuing positive signs. The most significant editorial achievement was the successful launch of the redesign of the print edition of C&EN with the Oct. 16, 2006, issue.
The Subcommittee on Copyright has successfully updated the Copyright Module on the ACS Publications website. The subcommittee is looking into the possibility of conducting copyright programs at future ACS national and regional meetings.
The final monitoring reports for Chemistry of Materials, Journal of Agricultural & Food Chemistry, and Molecular Pharmaceutics were presented and accepted by the committee. Journal of Chemical Information & Modeling, Organic Letters, Accounts of Chemical Research, and the Journal of Chemical Theory & Computation will be monitored next.
3. Examining the scientific basis of public policies related to the chemical sciences and making recommendations to the appropriate ACS units.
In the first of these areas, ComSci partnered with President Hunt and the Committee on Environmental Improvement in planning and hosting a sustainability luncheon that featured roundtable discussions centering on a key sustainability question. At the Boston national meeting, ComSci will deliver a full-day program on the subject of ""Partnerships in Innovation & Competitiveness.""
Regarding the second thrust, ComSci will present two programs in Boston: a box lunch that will feature two speakers taking opposing sides on the subject of ""Genetic Screening & Diagnostic Testing: Do You Really Want to Know?"" and a symposium titled ""Creating & Sustaining International Research Collaborations.""
In support of the last thrust, ComSci is planning two events for 2008: ""Balancing Security & Openness"" will gather data to determine if the recent emphasis on security is hindering scientific progress and ""Transitioning Chemical Science to Commercially Successful Products.""
The Women Chemists Committee (WCC) hosted more than 70 attendees at its open meeting recently in Chicago, where representatives from Iota Sigma Pi, Women in Science & Engineering, the Association of Women in Science, and the Chicago local section helped WCC celebrate the committee's 80th anniversary.
The Women in Industry Breakfast was also highly successful with a new format of speed networking. More than 100 participants had the opportunity to practice their elevator speeches and make several professional connections. A related workshop will be offered by WCC in Boston.
In Chicago, WCC sponsored two symposia, ""Women Achieving Success: The ACS as a Platform in Leadership Development"" in honor of Madeleine Joullié's 80th birthday and the ACS Award for Encouraging Women into Careers in the Chemical Sciences: Symposium in Honor of Bojan H. Jennings.
More than 225 ACS meeting attendees were present for the biannual WCC Luncheon and heard the keynote speaker Laura Kiessling, 2007 Francis P. Garvan-John Olin Medal Recipient. Twelve women presented their research at this meeting with funding by the WCC/Eli Lilly Travel Grant Award. WCC members also spent time educating expo attendees on programs offered by the ACS Office of Diversity Programs at its new booth.
In Chicago, the Younger Chemists Committee (YCC) welcomed its new committee members with an information session centered on YCC's charter as well as on its strategic plan: to make ACS relevant to younger chemists, to involve younger chemists in all levels of the society, and to integrate younger chemists into the profession.
In January, YCC again hosted a Leadership Development Workshop during the ACS Leaders Conference. There were more than 80 applications for the 15 awards, which covered travel and registration for the conference. YCC plans to again fund the travel awards and provide leadership training for young chemists in 2008. YCC also solicited applications and selected a new graduate student representative on the Graduate Education Advisory Board.
During the Chicago meeting, YCC programs included ""Starting a Successful Research Program at a Predominantly Undergraduate Institution,"" ""Career Experiences at the Interface of Chemistry & Biology,"" and ""Chemistry Pedagogy 101.""
In addition to these programs, YCC cosponsored five programs with various committees and divisions. YCC continues to reach out to ACS committees and divisions and has initiated liaisonships with 11 technical divisions to encourage technical programming that highlights the contributions of younger chemists. Looking forward to Boston, YCC is planning symposia including ""The Many Faces of Chemistry: International Opportunities for Chemists""; ""Being a Responsible Chemist: Ethics, Politics & Policy""; and ""Changing Landscapes of the Bio-Pharma Industry.""
The Committee on Committees (ConC) conducted its annual training session for new national committee chairs at the ACS Leaders Conference in January 2007. ConC's interactive session for committee chairs in Chicago served as an opportune follow-on and a forum for informative interchange among seasoned and new chairs.
ConC began developing its recommendations for the 2008 committee chair appointments for consideration by the president-elect and chair of the board. ConC continues to focus efforts to identify members with the skills and expertise specified by the committee chairs using the councilor preference form.
The form will be sent to councilors in May. ConC also seeks the names of noncouncilor members for consideration for service on council-related committees, especially those with no prior appointment.
As part of ongoing activities with the joint CPC-Board Governance Review Task Force, ConC has collected data on committee liaisons to other committees. This information will be distributed to committee chairs. The number of liaisons indicates that unofficial but strong communication channels exist within the ACS committee structure.
On Sunday evening, the Committee on Nominations & Elections (N&E) sponsored its fifth successful Town Hall Meeting for President-Elect Nominees. An estimated 200 people attended this session. This forum facilitated communication among the 2008 president-elect nominees, councilors, and other members. N&E will hold another Town Hall Meeting featuring the candidates for director-at-large at the fall meeting in Boston.
Now that voting over the Internet has become an accepted procedure for ACS national elections, the ACS technical divisions and local sections have expressed strong interest in using this method for their elections. N&E has developed protocols for elections for local sections and divisions. This document will be forwarded to the appropriate committees for their review and distribution.
N&E is responsible for reviewing annually the distribution of member populations within the six electoral districts to ensure that the districts have equitable representation. According to bylaw V, section 4(a), the member population of each electoral district must be within 10% of the result of dividing by six the number of members whose addresses lie within these districts. The committee is happy to report that the six electoral districts are in compliance.
The committee has developed a petition on election procedures for president-elect and district director. The proposed election mechanism provides for a preferential (ranked) ballot and an ""instant runoff."" N&E continues to address the areas of campaigning and the timing of our national election process. Between the Chicago and Boston meetings, the committee plans to sponsor online forums for input from councilors and other interested members on these issues.
In response to member concerns regarding the collection of signatures for petition candidates, N&E reviewed the society's bylaws. The bylaws state that an endorsement is required, but does not stipulate the method of endorsement. N&E has determined that original or electronic signatures are acceptable and will establish appropriate procedures for receipt of electronic signatures.
The Committee on Constitution & Bylaws (C&B), acting for the council, issued new certified bylaws to the Corning Section, the Portland Section, the Division of Colloid & Surface Chemistry, and the Division of Chemical Education. The committee reviewed new proposed amendments for the Division of Medicinal Chemistry, the Columbus Section, the Detroit Section, and the Southern Arizona Section.
Three petitions were presented to council for action at this meeting. Regarding the ""Petition on Election Procedures 2006,"" a motion to separate the petition was approved, and the petition was divided. Provisions affecting bylaw V, sec. 2d, bylaw V, sec. 3c, and bylaw V, sec. 4f, which deal with election procedures and the timing of run-off elections, were approved by council and will become effective following confirmation by the board of directors.
The second part of the petition regarding bylaw V, sec. 2c, and bylaw V, sec. 3b, which deal with signature requirements for petition candidates for president-elect and director-at-large respectively, was recommitted to the Committee on Nominations & Elections, which has primary substantive responsibility for the petition.
The Committee on Nominations & Elections was asked to reconsider the signature requirements, procedures for acceptance of electronic signatures, and recommendations from the Governance Review Task Force on election procedures.
The second petition presented to council for action was the ""Petition on Rules for Nominating Members of N&E for National Offices."" This petition was not approved by council. The third petition, the ""Petition on Multiyear Dues,"" was amended by incidental motion on the council floor, calling for the petition to become effective when technical components are instituted to track payments, but no later than Jan. 1, 2010. Council approved the incidental motion and then approved the petition.
The committee reviewed one petition for consideration, the ""Petition on Local Section Affiliations,"" which will be submitted to council for action at the fall 2007 meeting in Boston.
The committee met with representatives of the Committee on Membership Affairs and the Governance Review Task Force to continue discussions on proposals currently being formulated on membership requirements and student membership. In addition, the committee discussed election issues of concern to the Southern California Section.
We hope you enjoyed the presidential and division thematic program, ""Sustainability of Energy, Food & Water"" in Chicago. A small, dedicated group of volunteers and staff labored tirelessly to create and coordinate this programming; to them the Committee on Divisional Activities (DAC) offers sincere thanks.
DAC has committed to transfer the process of choosing and organizing future national meeting themes to a body that represents all divisions. We made substantial progress in Chicago, where division, secretariat, and committee representatives convened to discuss national meeting program concepts. They proposed themes for the 2008 Philadelphia national meeting as well as a framework for a future national programming group.
Divisions have successfully served their members fortunate enough to attend national meetings. To maximize benefits to division members, DAC encourages divisions to consider extending the reach of the content they deliver at national meetings through Internet-based distribution channels and will support worthy efforts in this direction via Innovative Program Grants.
The committee voted in Chicago to propose modifications to the division funding formula that will more greatly reward interdisciplinary programming. The new formula will also be simpler and more transparent to divisions. DAC will present the revised plan to council for action in Boston.
The Committee on Economic & Professional Affairs (CEPA), working with ACS staff in the Departments of Career Management & Development and Member Research & Technology, continues to update and implement its strategic plan to address the career needs of society members.
Specifically, the committee reviewed and revised existing workshops and materials to help ACS members get jobs. CEPA is developing new programs to address the needs of mid- and late-career chemists to ensure their continued competitiveness in the workplace and to ease their career transitions. New initiatives in these areas include the development of workshops, online training, surveys to assess member needs, suggested changes to public policies, and updates to professional and ethical workplace guidelines. As a result of discussions at the Public Policy Roundtable, which was held in San Francisco, a background paper is being developed on trends in health care issues.
The newly revised ""Chemical Professional's Code of Conduct"" was presented to council, which approved it. The Standards & Ethics Subcommittee is preparing a revision of the ""Academic Professional Guidelines"" to be presented to council for consideration in Boston.
CEPA reviewed the Globalization Task Force Report. As our science diffuses around the globe, we want to make sure that our members are aware of the economic and professional challenges they will face and that they have the tools they need to succeed. Therefore, CEPA made a commitment to work with other committees, divisions, and ACS staff to develop programs and policies that position our membership to compete in the global workforce.
CEPA heard and discussed a presentation on the proposal from the Membership Affairs Committee on broadening the requirements of membership. CEPA supports the spirit of this proposal and encourages further detailed studies to assess financial impacts on local sections and student affiliates chapters.
The Local Section Activities Committee (LSAC) recognized local sections celebrating significant anniversaries in 2007, including Savannah River (50 years), Northeast Tennessee (75 years), and the St. Louis and Syracuse local sections (both celebrating 100 years).
LSAC hosted the local section leaders track in conjunction with the ACS Leaders Conference in Baltimore on Jan. 26–28. A total of 135 delegates from 124 local sections participated in the weekend leadership conference.
LSAC also hosted a Local Section Summit on March 2–4 in Arlington, Va. The summit focused on practical operational issues that will support local sections' long-term success. Specific areas that were discussed include the development of a multiyear plan to expand or develop programming for local sections, opportunities to encourage innovation and experimentation within and among local sections, and capitalizing on existing opportunities to facilitate partnerships between local sections and other ACS groups.
Following the San Francisco national meeting, LSAC launched a local section Science Café minigrant program. Fifty-five local sections accepted LSAC invitation to host Science Cafés in 2007.
A DVD entitled ""ACS Close to Home: Local Sections Connecting Chemistry & the Community"" was released earlier this year. The video provides a seven-minute overview of the many outreach and educational programs sponsored by local sections and the critical role they play in positively influencing the public's perception of chemistry and its practitioners. Copies of the DVD were sent to all local section officers.
The Committee on Meetings & Expositions (M&E) reported that the 233rd ACS national meeting hosted 14,520 attendees. This included 7,152 chemical scientists, 5,059 students, 1,283 exhibitors, 119 precollege teachers, 573 exposition visitors, and 453 guests. The exposition had 424 booths with 268 companies.
The 10 2006 regional meetings set a new standard for excellence with attendance exceeding 8,000, a 30% increase in average meeting attendance compared to the 2005 meetings. A total of 4,717 abstracts were submitted. A region summit was held in February at which the final report of the ReACT study group was reviewed.
The practice of tracking the number of presenter no-shows continues. M&E will collaborate with the Committee on Divisional Activities to study options for addressing this problem. Suggestions will be presented at the Boston meeting for implementation in 2008.
It is the intent of M&E to pursue the goal of making our meetings ""greener."" We will communicate with staff and governance units to identify actions for both the short and long term.
The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) and ACS will hold their 2008 spring meetings simultaneously in New Orleans. An ad hoc working group consisting of members from M&E, DAC, and AIChE are actively exploring joint programming opportunities for this meeting.
The Committee on Membership Affairs (MAC) met in executive session on Saturday and Sunday in Chicago and reported that the ACS closed 2006 with 160,491 members, our highest year-end membership count since 2002. Of the 17,857 applications processed in 2006, more than 1,000 came from the Member-Get-a-Member campaign in which many councilors participated. The society's retention rate in 2006 remained strong at 92%. The committee also reported that recruitment for the first two months of 2007 netted 2,844 new applications—729 more than for the same time period last year.
MAC continues to work with deliberate speed on the proposed new bylaw language for members, student members, and society affiliates-the three ways to connect to the society. The committee received input from the Governance Review Task Force and its action teams, the Council Policy Committee, the board of directors, the Committee on Constitution & Bylaws, and several other committees between the San Francisco and Chicago meetings. These interactions have resulted in the current bylaw change recommendations.
In Chicago, representatives from MAC attended several committee meetings and all seven councilor caucuses to summarize the current proposal for membership changes, answer questions, and seek input. In addition, all committee chairs were invited to have their respective committees review these bylaw changes and respond to MAC—if possible—before council met on Wednesday. MAC received 11 responses: eight supported the proposed changes as is, and three supported the proposed language with specified changes or considerations.
The comprehensive petition will likely represent the most significant and voluminous change in the ACS bylaws that has occurred in decades, and MAC is proud to be among the leaders in its development and in efforts to get it right the first time. Hundreds of individuals have contributed to this major effort, since MAC began such discussions at the spring 2004 national meeting.
The Committee on Ethics met in Chicago and discussed the possibility of organizing and scheduling a committee retreat in the near future to enable the committee to move from the current stage of exploring the needs and interests of ACS members to setting priorities for the next few years.
The Project SEED program offers summer research opportunities for high school students from economically disadvantaged families. Since its inception in 1968, the program has had a significant impact on the lives of more than 8,400 students. At the selection meeting in March, the committee approved research projects for 340 SEED I students and 98 SEED II students for this summer in more than 100 institutions.
The 2006 annual assessment surveys from 300 students indicate that 78% of the Project SEED participants are planning to major in a chemistry-related science, and 66% aspire to continue to graduate education. This program is made possible by contributions from industry, academia, local sections, ACS friends and members, the ACS Petroleum Research Fund, and the Project SEED Endowment.
The committee formally submitted a request to ConC to amend the Project SEED acronym and the committee duties described in the Supplementary Information of the ""ACS Charter, Constitution, Bylaws & Regulations.""
In Chicago, the committee's agenda focused on the ACS Strategic Plan and how Project SEED fits into it, the Program Review Advisory Group (PRAG) review of the Project SEED program, the committee's review of an online application form, and planning of the 40th anniversary celebration to be held at the Philadelphia meeting in the fall of 2008. The committee selected a task force to review the criteria for selection of the Project SEED ChemLuminary Award.
3. Making ACS relevant to technicians.
Last year, CTA, along with the Division of Chemical Technicians, the Committee on Economic & Professional Affairs, and ChemTechLinks, started the Equipping the 2015 Chemical Technology Workforce initiative. This year, the initiative awarded six $500 minigrants to activities and programs that support the educational and professional development of chemical technicians.
We are pleased to announce that the winners of the minigrants are the ACS Division of Environmental Chemistry; the Chemical Technician Program Chair for the 39th ACS Central Regional Meeting in Covington, Ky.; Delta College, University Center, Mich.; Grand Rapids Community College, in Michigan; Mount San Antonio College, Walnut, Calif.; and Southwestern College in Chula Vista, Calif.
The winners are collaborating with industry, academia, and ACS local sections on such activities as chemical technology career fairs for high school students, discussion panels on employability skills for technicians, and technical programming at regional and national meetings on the vital role technicians have in the chemical enterprise.
Because of the enthusiastic response to the minigrants, Equipping the 2015 Chemical Technology Workforce will be supporting another round of minigrants to be distributed in the fall. Details will be available on the website. For more information, go to www.ChemTechLinks.org and click on ""Equipping the 2015 Chemical Technology Workforce.""
CTA has also joined with the Joint Subcommittee on Diversity, formerly known as the Collaboration of Committees Working Group. Because this group is focused on increasing diversity in ACS and the chemical enterprise, we believe that this is an opportunity to raise awareness of the value of technicians. CTA looks forward to collaborating on the promotion of traditionally underrepresented chemical professionals.
In 2007, CTA will be placing renewed focus on distribution of the ACS Chemical Technology Student Recognition Award. The award recognizes academic excellence in students preparing for careers as chemical technicians. For more information on the award, please visit the CTA website at chemistry.org/committees/cta.","['There are 14,520 attendees, including 7,152 chemical scientists, 5,059 students, 1,283 exhibitors, 119 precollege teachers, 573 exposition visitors, and 453 guests.']",6444,multifieldqa_en,en,,ddfed65e5495d0257b22a9537993c3453d8590cc94b8e0d6," The major actions taken by the board of directors and council during the national meeting in Chicago were reported in C&EN, April 30 (page 32). The society ended 2006 with a net contribution from operations of $12.2 million, on revenues of $424.0 million and expenses of $411.8 million. The committee discussed the Education Division programs that were reviewed in 2006 and those that will be reviewed in 2007, under the auspices of the Program Review Advisory Group. Committee members strongly support the proposal to include undergraduates as members of the society, but they requested that financial arrangements be clearly spelled out in the petition to ensure that the highly successful Student Affiliates program remains intact. Committee voted to accept the recommendations of the ACS Petroleum Research Fund Advisory Board (February 2007 meeting) for funding grants totaling $5.2million. voted to recommend to the ACS Board of Directors that a new national award be established, the ""ACS Award for Affordable Green Chemistry,"" sponsored by Rohm and Haas. The committee met in executive session on March 23 and in open session jointly with the Joint Board-Council Committee on Publications and the Division of Chemical Information on March 26. The committee received a briefing on the status of the MORE Project: Multidisciplinary Opportunities though Resource Enhancement. Twenty-eight proposals were received, and a decision on which proposals to support will be made in early May. The chair led a discussion on draft 2007 committee goals, and committee members offered several suggestions related to successfully meeting them. Committee members agreed to the creation of a pilot ACS state government affairs advocacy program. The 2007 Public Policy Priorities Survey resulted in a four-tiered ranking of ACS's 2007 public policies. The ranking will help focus staff resources in conducting outreach and advocacy on behalf of ACS members. The Committee on Chemical Safety (CCS) seeks to ensure safe facilities, designs, and operations by calling attention to potential hazards and stimulating education in safe practices. CCS has been involved in collaborations for the updating of publications like ""Prudent Practices in the Laboratory"" and ""ACS Guidelines for the Teaching of High School Chemistry"" The Committee on Chemists with Disabilities (CWD) met at the 233rd ACS national meeting, Chicago, on March 26. CWD Ambassador Program that was announced at CWD's 25th anniversary celebration at the Washington, D.C., meeting was discussed. CCA gave feedback to a recommendations report from the ACS Board Committee on Professional & Member Relations Task Force on Globalization. The third edition of the ""Chemical Safety Manual for Small Businesses"" will be ready soon. The Chemists Celebrate Earth Day celebration occurred in 120 local sections with 138 coordinators leading the efforts within their communities. This represents an increase of more than 30% in local section and coordinator participation from 2006. A special outreach event is being planned for Sunday, Aug. 19. Hands-on activities will focus on health and wellness. CCA received two funding proposals that total $7,500. Funding was provided to the following: The Committee on Economic & Professional Affairs at $3,000 for the Chicago symposium on ""Benefits Trends for the Chemical Workforce"" and the Office of Graduate Education and the Department of Career Development & Management at $4,500 for a workshop on ""Preparing for Life after Graduate School"" The subcommittee also requested that CCA earmark approximately $20,000 of Corporation Associates funds in 2008 for its activities. The subcommittee gave an update on a Boston symposium cosponsored by Corporation Associates and the Medicinal Chemistry Division featuring past ACS Heroes of Chemistry from the pharmaceutical industry. The committee held a dialogue with representatives of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency who are trying to ""green"" federal conferences and work with the travel and tourism industry to change practices and shrink the environmental footprint of meetings. The Committee on Minority Affairs (CMA) approved new vision, mission, and values statements at the Chicago national meeting. Committee on Patents & Related Matters (CPRM) discussed proposed legislative and regulatory changes to the U.S. patent system. Committee reviewed 42 new and additional information reports from ACS-approved chemistry programs. The committee reviewed the editorial policies for the 2007 edition of the ACS Directory of Graduate Research, which is using a new protocol for retrieving research publication titles. The Committee on Professional Training (CPT) held conferences with four schools seeking approval, discussed three updates and five site visit reports, and approved three new schools. The total number of ACS- approved chemistry programs is now 642. The CMA continues to support the work of the Joint Subcommittee on Diversity (JSD) in developing programs, products, and services to ensure full participation of all members in ACS. It also continued its work on several new educational tools to assist and inform members on patent issues and other intellectual property matters. The Subcommittee on Copyright has successfully updated the Copyright Module on the ACS Publications website. ComSci is planning two events for 2008: ""Balancing Security & Openness"" and ""Transitioning Chemical Science to Commercially Successful Products"" The Women Chemists Committee (WCC) hosted more than 70 attendees at its open meeting recently in Chicago, where representatives from Iota Sigma Pi, Women in Science & Engineering, the Association of Women in science, and the Chicago local section helped WCC celebrate the committee's 80th anniversary. More than 225 ACS meeting attendees were present for the biannual WCC Luncheon and heard the keynote speaker Laura Kiessling, 2007 Francis P. Garvan-John Olin Medal Recipient. There were more than 80 applications for the 15 awards, which covered travel and registration for the conference. The subcommittee is looking into the possibility of conducting copyright programs at future ACS national and regional meetings. The final monitoring reports for Chemistry of Materials, Journal of Agricultural & Food Chemistry, and Molecular Pharmaceutics were presented. The Committee on Committees (ConC) conducted its annual training session for new national committee chairs at the ACS Leaders Conference in January 2007. ConC began developing its recommendations for the 2008 committee chair appointments for consideration by the president-elect and chair of the board. The Committee on Nominations & Elections (N&E) sponsored its fifth successful Town Hall Meeting for President-Elect Nominees. N&E is responsible for reviewing annually the distribution of member populations within the six electoral districts to ensure that the districts have equitable representation. The number of liaisons indicates that unofficial but strong communication channels exist within the ACS committee structure. The committee has developed a petition on election procedures for president-Elect and district director. The proposed election mechanism provides for a preferential (ranked) ballot and an ""instant runoff"" for the national election process. The group is planning symposia including ""The Many Faces of Chemistry: International Opportunities for Chemists"" The Committee on Constitution & Bylaws (C&B), acting for the council, issued new certified bylaws. The committee reviewed new proposed amendments for the Division of Medicinal Chemistry, the Columbus Section, the Detroit Section, and the Southern Arizona Section. A motion to separate the ""Petition on Election Procedures 2006"" was approved. The Committee on Nominations & Elections was asked to reconsider the signature requirements, procedures for acceptance of electronic signatures, and recommendations from the Governance Review Task Force on election procedures. The second petition was not approved by council. The third petition was amended by incidental motion, calling for the petition to become effective when technical components are instituted to track payments, but no later than Jan. 1, 2010. The fourth petition was submitted to council for consideration, which will be submitted at the fall 2007 meeting in Boston. The fifth petition was presented to council to discuss election issues of concern to the Southern California Section. The Committee on Economic & Professional Affairs (CEPA) continues to update and implement its strategic plan to address the career needs of society members. The committee reviewed and revised existing workshops and materials to help ACS members get jobs.

What did Justice Kennedy argue about Quill in Direct Marketing Ass'n v. Brohl?,"South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. - Harvard Law Review
Fourth Circuit Invalidates Maryland Statute Regulating Price Gouging in the Sale of Generic Drugs.
South Dakota Supreme Court Holds Unconstitutional State Law Requiring Internet Retailers Without In-State Physical Presence to Remit Sales Tax.
Judicial junk, the Court has long thought, is easier to scrap when the erroneous precedent cannot be fixed by Congress, as in constitutional cases.1× 1. See Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 405–10 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); Lee Epstein, William M. Landes & Adam Liptak, The Decision to Depart (or Not) from Constitutional Precedent: An Empirical Study of the Roberts Court, 90 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1115, 1116 (2015) (“[Justice Brandeis’s] dissenting opinion . . . now has the status of black letter law.”). On the flip side, whenever a bad precedent can be corrected by Congress, stare decisis applies with “special force.”2× 2. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 172–73 (1989). The Court, following Justice Brandeis, usually articulates the rule as distinguishing between “constitutional” and “statutory” precedents. See, e.g., id. But the distinction is occasionally said to be between “constitutional” and “nonconstitutional cases.” See, e.g., Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 543 (1962) (plurality opinion). Nomenclature aside, the Court has — until now — adhered to Justice Brandeis’s key insight that the important factor is whether or not the mistake may be legislatively corrected. Last Term, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.,3× 3. 138 S. Ct. 2080 (2018). the Court tinkered with this thinking in overruling an outdated dormant commerce clause precedent. Dormant commerce clause decisions technically produce constitutional holdings, but Congress may override them at will.4× 4. See Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408, 421–27 (1946). Under the usual logic of stare decisis, it should take special force to dislodge such precedents. But Wayfair applied the weakened stare decisis of constitutional cases, asserting that the Court must “address a false constitutional premise . . . . whether or not Congress can or will act.”5× 5. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096–97.
Emerging from Wayfair is an odd and ominous development in stare decisis doctrine. Odd, because it turns on a formal classification instead of on Congress’s practical ability to fix the problem. Ominous, because the Court’s logic leads far past the dormant commerce clause. Wayfair grants only feeble stare decisis to precedents that set a “constitutional default rule,”6× 6. Id. at 2096 (“While . . . Congress has the authority to change the physical presence rule, Congress cannot change the constitutional default rule.”). meaning constitutional decisions that allow for legislative adjustment or override. This new stare decisis analysis makes other precedents setting constitutional default rules more vulnerable — including, perhaps, mainstays of criminal procedure like Miranda v. Arizona7× 7. 384 U.S. 436 (1966). and Mapp v. Ohio.8× 8. 367 U.S. 643 (1961).
Since its 1967 decision in National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue,9× 9. 386 U.S. 753 (1967). the Court has held that, under the “dormant” or “negative” implication of the Commerce Clause,10× 10. The dormant or negative commerce clause is a judicial derivation from the Commerce Clause “prohibiting States from discriminating against or imposing excessive burdens on interstate commerce without congressional approval,” which “strikes at one of the chief evils that led to the adoption of the Constitution, namely, state tariffs and other laws that burdened interstate commerce.” Comptroller of the Treasury of Md. v. Wynne, 135 S. Ct. 1787, 1794 (2015). states may not compel remote sellers with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales taxes.11× 11. See Bellas Hess, 386 U.S. at 759–60. In Quill Corp. v. North Dakota,12× 12. 504 U.S. 298 (1992). the Court refused to overrule the “bright-line, physical-presence requirement” of Bellas Hess, leaning heavily on stare decisis.13× 13. Id. at 317–18. Three Justices joined a concurrence explaining that their decision rested solely “on the basis of stare decisis.” Id. at 320 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). So the physical presence test remained the law of the land while the internet conquered the earth. Justice Kennedy had joined the Quill majority and Justice Scalia’s concurring opinion emphasizing stare decisis, but by 2015 he had second thoughts. Writing separately in Direct Marketing Ass’n v. Brohl,14× 14. 135 S. Ct. 1124 (2015). Justice Kennedy acknowledged that “[t]he Internet has caused far-reaching systemic and structural changes in the economy” and therefore “Quill now harms States to a degree far greater than could have been anticipated earlier.”15× 15. Id. at 1135 (Kennedy, J., concurring). He concluded with the wish that “[t]he legal system should find an appropriate case for this Court to reexamine Quill and Bellas Hess.”16× 16. Id.
Seldom has a concurring opinion signed by a lone Justice prompted a state to officially declare an emergency. Yet in 2016, in response to Justice Kennedy’s overture, the South Dakota legislature passed a law, S.B. 106, “to provide for the collection of sales taxes from certain remote sellers . . . and to declare an emergency.”17× 17. 2016 S.D. Sess. Laws ch. 70 pmbl. 217 (codified at S.D. Codified Laws § 10-64 (2017)). It required every remote seller to collect and remit sales tax if the seller’s business in South Dakota comprised either a “gross revenue” greater than $100,000 or at least 200 “separate transactions” within one calendar year.18× 18. Id. § 1. Significantly, the law did not apply retroactively.19× 19. Id. § 5. The “emergency” declaration was necessary to give the law immediate effect, for the purpose of “permitting the most expeditious possible review of the constitutionality of this law” by the U.S. Supreme Court.20× 20. Id. § 8(8). As Justice Alito put it, the “South Dakota law [was] obviously a test case.”21× 21. Transcript of Oral Argument at 27, Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. 2080 (No. 17-494), https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2017/17-494_7lho.pdf [https://perma.cc/8HYH-VU8N].
Expeditiously, a group of remote sellers challenged the law. After being sued by South Dakota for refusing to register for the newly required sales tax license, Wayfair, Inc., Overstock.com, Inc., and Newegg, Inc. moved for summary judgment in South Dakota circuit court on the grounds that S.B. 106 was unconstitutional under Quill and Bellas Hess — a point South Dakota conceded, indicating that it was seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Quill.22× 22. State v. Wayfair Inc., 2017 SD 56, ¶¶ 9–11, 901 N.W.2d 754, 759–60. Accordingly, the South Dakota circuit court granted the motion for summary judgment and South Dakota appealed to the state’s highest court.23× 23. Id. ¶ 12, 901 N.W.2d at 760. The South Dakota Supreme Court unanimously affirmed, recognizing that South Dakota’s “arguments on the merits” may be “persuasive” but “Quill remains the controlling precedent.”24× 24. Id. ¶ 18, 901 N.W.2d at 761. See generally Recent Case, State v. Wayfair Inc., 2017 SD 56, 901 N.W.2d 754 (S.D. 2017), 131 Harv. L. Rev. 2089 (2018).
The U.S. Supreme Court vacated and remanded.25× 25. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2100. Writing for the Court one last time, Justice Kennedy26× 26. Justices Thomas, Ginsburg, Alito, and Gorsuch joined Justice Kennedy’s opinion. pilloried Quill’s physical presence rule as “arbitrary, formalistic,” “anachronistic,” and “unfair and unjust” to both states and brick-and-mortar retailers.27× 27. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2092, 2095. After all, the rationale of Quill was that remote sellers lacked a sufficiently “substantial nexus” with the state to justify imposing a duty of tax collection.28× 28. Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298, 311 (1992) (quoting Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274, 279 (1977)). This was wrong even in the mail-order catalog days of 1967 and 1992, but “the Internet revolution has made [Quill’s] earlier error all the more egregious and harmful.”29× 29. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2097; see also id. at 2092. The rule deprived the states of billions of dollars, since they could not force remote sellers to collect the tax and consumers hardly ever paid it on their own.30× 30. Id. at 2088 (“[C]onsumer compliance rates are notoriously low.”). Quill “serve[d] as a judicially created tax shelter” for remote retailers who do a great deal of business online.31× 31. Id. at 2094.
Satisfied that Bellas Hess and Quill were wrongly decided, the Court then jumped the hurdle of stare decisis. The Quill Court had feared upsetting reliance interests.32× 32. Quill, 504 U.S. at 317 (“Bellas Hess . . . has engendered substantial reliance and has become part of the basic framework of a sizable industry.”). Wayfair shrugged off this concern, noting that “stare decisis accommodates only ‘legitimate reliance interest[s]’”; by contrast, reliance on the physical presence rule was largely due to consumers evading their use-tax obligations.33× 33. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2098 (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 824 (1982)). Quill had also appealed to Congress’s ultimate authority over interstate commerce as a reason to abide by a precedent, even if wrongly decided.34× 34. See Quill, 504 U.S. at 318–19; id. at 320 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (“Congress . . . can change the rule of Bellas Hess by simply saying so.”). But Wayfair denied that Congress’s ability to change the law was a proper consideration:
While it can be conceded that Congress has the authority to change the physical presence rule, Congress cannot change the constitutional default rule. It is inconsistent with the Court’s proper role to ask Congress to address a false constitutional premise of this Court’s own creation. Courts have acted as the front line of review in this limited sphere; and hence it is important that their principles be accurate and logical, whether or not Congress can or will act in response.35× 35. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096–97.
Having dispensed with the physical presence rule, the Court remanded the case to the South Dakota courts to determine in the first instance “whether some other principle in the Court’s Commerce Clause doctrine might invalidate the Act.”36× 36. Id. at 2099. But the Court listed “several features [of South Dakota law] that appear[ed] designed to prevent discrimination against or undue burdens upon interstate commerce.” Id.
Justices Thomas and Gorsuch each filed concurring opinions. Justice Thomas wistfully likened himself to Justice White — who voted for Bellas Hess but against Quill a quarter-century later — and confessed that he “should have joined [Justice White’s dissenting] opinion.”37× 37. Id. at 2100 (Thomas, J., concurring). Justice Thomas added that the “Court’s entire negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence” is wrong and should be abandoned.38× 38. Id. Justice Gorsuch also wrote separately to express skepticism of the Court’s dormant commerce clause jurisprudence, raising “questions for another day” of whether the doctrine “can be squared with the text of the Commerce Clause, justified by stare decisis, or defended as misbranded products of federalism or antidiscrimination imperatives flowing from Article IV’s Privileges and Immunities Clause.”39× 39. Id. at 2100–01 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).
Chief Justice Roberts dissented.40× 40. Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined the Chief Justice’s dissent. Surprisingly, the dissenting Justices “agree[d] that Bellas Hess was wrongly decided, for many of the reasons given by the Court.”41× 41. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2101 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). The dispute between the majority and the dissent turned entirely on the principles and application of stare decisis. Chief Justice Roberts argued that whether or how to reverse Quill should be left to Congress, which “has the flexibility to address these questions in a wide variety of ways” and “can focus directly on current policy concerns rather than past legal mistakes.”42× 42. Id. at 2104. He also pointed to the “baffling” burdens of compliance with the idiosyncratic tax codes of “[o]ver 10,000 jurisdictions,” particularly for small businesses, and doubted that new “software” — the majority’s proposed solution to this mess43× 43. Id. at 2098 (majority opinion) (“Eventually, software that is available at a reasonable cost may make it easier for small businesses to cope with these problems.”). — would soon solve the problem.44× 44. Id. at 2103–04 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). In Bellas Hess, the Court reasoned that the dormant commerce clause protects interstate business from being “entangle[d] . . . in a virtual welter of complicated obligations to local jurisdictions.” Nat’l Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Dep’t of Revenue, 386 U.S. 753, 759–60 (1967). The dissent replied that the Court “vastly underestimate[d] the skill of contemporary man and his machines.” Id. at 766 (Fortas, J., dissenting). The dispute in Wayfair over whether software is up to the task effectively reprised the old debate from Bellas Hess, only this time couched as part of the stare decisis inquiry’s concern for reliance interests rather than as a matter of dormant commerce clause doctrine. While Wayfair acknowledged that “[c]omplex state tax systems could have the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce,” 138 S. Ct. at 2099, the Court remarked that “[t]he physical presence rule is a poor proxy” for an inquiry into any actual burdens imposed on interstate commerce, id. at 2093.
Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that a “heightened form of stare decisis”45× 45. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2102 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). applies when “Congress . . . can, if it wishes, override this Court’s decisions with contrary legislation.”46× 46. Id. at 2101 (first citing Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Cmty., 134 S. Ct. 2024, 2036 (2014) (tribal sovereign immunity); then citing Kimble v. Marvel Entm’t, LLC, 135 S. Ct. 2401, 2409 (2015) (statutory interpretation); and then citing Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2398, 2411 (2014) (judicially created doctrine implementing a judicially created cause of action)). In Quill, the Chief Justice noted, the Court had taken to heart that “Congress may be better qualified” and “has the ultimate power to resolve” the question47× 47. Id. at 2102 (quoting Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 279, 318 (1992)). while Justice Scalia had “recogniz[ed] that stare decisis has ‘special force’ in the dormant Commerce Clause context due to Congress’s ‘final say over regulation of interstate commerce.’”48× 48. Id. (quoting Quill, 504 U.S. at 320 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment)). Moreover, “[i]f stare decisis applied with special force in Quill, it should be an even greater impediment” afterward since Quill effectively “tossed [the ball] into Congress’s court.”49× 49. Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Kimble, 135 S. Ct. at 2409); cf. Bay Mills, 134 S. Ct. at 2039 n.12 (“When we inform Congress that it has primary responsibility over a sphere of law, and invite Congress to consider a specific issue within that sphere, we cannot deem irrelevant how Congress responds.”). Because the Court invited Congress to act and then “suddenly chang[ed] the ground rules, the Court may have waylaid Congress’s consideration of the issue.”50× 50. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2102–03 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).
In Wayfair, the Court applied the flimsier form of stare decisis to a precedent that could have been overruled by Congress. It did so in the context of a dormant commerce clause case, but Wayfair’s logic extends to all constitutional default rules — that is, constitutional decisions that Congress remains free to change. Not only does Wayfair deviate from the Court’s decades-old stare decisis analysis, it also imperils other precedents that set constitutional default rules.
The Court’s reasoning in Wayfair departs from its prior stare decisis analysis. In 1932, Justice Brandeis posited that stare decisis must bend “in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible.”51× 51. Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406–07 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). The Court has long since adopted his argument,52× 52. See, e.g., Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 665 (1944). as well as its corollary — that stare decisis commands “special force in the area of statutory interpretation” where “Congress remains free to alter what [the Court has] done.”53× 53. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 172–73 (1989). For normative evaluations of heightened stare decisis for statutory precedents, see generally Einer Elhauge, Statutory Default Rules: How to Interpret Unclear Legislation 211–23 (2008); and William N. Eskridge, Jr., Overruling Statutory Precedents, 76 Geo. L.J. 1361, 1364–1409 (1988). Justice Brandeis’s logic demands that dormant commerce clause cases, where Congress is free to act, be granted the weightier stare decisis.54× 54. Scholars have noted the curious fact that Justice Brandeis included many dormant commerce clause cases as examples of overruled constitutional precedents. See, e.g., Earl M. Maltz, Commentary, Some Thoughts on the Death of Stare Decisis in Constitutional Law, 1980 Wis. L. Rev. 467, 468–469, 469 n.11. One explanation for this is that Justice Brandeis sought the authority of Chief Justice Taney’s dictum that the Court’s “opinion upon the construction of the Constitution is always open to discussion” — which referred to the dormant commerce clause. See Burnet, 285 U.S. at 408 n.3 (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (quoting The Passenger Cases, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 283, 470 (1849) (Taney, C.J., dissenting)). In Chief Justice Taney’s time, it was thought that Congress could not override the Court’s dormant commerce clause decisions, see Cooley v. Bd. of Wardens, 53 U.S. (12 How.) 299, 321 (1852), so the context of Chief Justice Taney’s dictum does not conflict with Justice Brandeis’s theory of stare decisis. The Court applied this reasoning in Quill, as Chief Justice Roberts underscored.55× 55. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2102 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).
Yet the Wayfair majority refused to consider Congress’s authority to legislate as a relevant factor for stare decisis.56× 56. Even Justice Kennedy’s earlier opinion in Direct Marketing contemplated judicially overruling Quill, conspicuously neglecting a possible legislative solution. See supra p. 278. The Court even insisted that to do so “is inconsistent with the Court’s proper role,” since Quill embodied “a false constitutional premise of th[e] Court’s own creation.”57× 57. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096 (emphasis added). This refusal breaks from the practical Brandeisian wisdom that has guided the Court’s treatment of precedent for the better part of a century. The point is not that stare decisis should have ultimately propped up Bellas Hess yet again, as Wayfair’s dissenting Justices maintained. After all, a realistic approach that is alert to each branch’s institutional capacities might have led to the conclusion that Congress was actually ill-equipped to overrule Quill. In this vein, the Court could have sensibly pointed out that Congress is unlikely to stick its neck out with a tax hike (or a look-alike) from which only the states would benefit.58× 58. For two practical arguments to this effect, see Brian Galle, Essay, Kill Quill, Keep the Dormant Commerce Clause: History’s Lessons on Congressional Control of State Taxation, 70 Stan. L. Rev. Online 158, 160–62 (2018), https://review.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/70-Stan.-L.-Rev.-Online-158-Galle.pdf [https://perma.cc/22YP-P4V5]; Edward A. Zelinsky, The Political Process Argument for Overruling Quill, 82 Brook. L. Rev. 1177, 1191–92 (2017). Indeed, South Dakota advanced such practical arguments in its brief.59× 59. See Petitioner’s Brief at 54, Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. 2080 (No. 17-494) (“Congress has little incentive to act here because it would be (or appear to be) authorizing new or greater tax collections from its constituents, while receiving none of the revenue in return.”). More generally, the Court might have discussed the limits of the states’ influence in the federal system as a reason not to wait for congressional intervention, a topic it has debated on other occasions.60× 60. See Richard H. Pildes, Institutional Formalism and Realism in Constitutional and Public Law, 2013 Sup. Ct. Rev. 1, 30–32; see also Galle, supra note 58, at 159 (“Congress is not a trustworthy guardian of state fiscal power, making continuing judicial involvement a more appealing prospect.”). Or it could have argued that new facts on the ground — namely, the blast of e-commerce that hit like a comet after Quill — overpowered stare decisis of any force, special or plain.61× 61. Two recent studies of stare decisis highlighted the physical presence rule as exemplifying a precedent that may reasonably be overruled due to changed facts. See Bryan A. Garner et al., The Law of Judicial Precedent 364–65 (2016); Randy J. Kozel, Settled Versus Right: A Theory of Precedent 112–13 (2017). It should be noted that the authors of The Law of Judicial Precedent classify the physical presence rule as a constitutional precedent for stare decisis purposes, thus anticipating the Court’s misstep in Wayfair. Garner et al., supra, at 354–65. Because even statutory precedents may sometimes be overruled,62× 62. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 173–74 (1989) (discussing justifications for overruling statutory precedents). Contra Lawrence C. Marshall, “Let Congress Do It”: The Case for an Absolute Rule of Statutory Stare Decisis, 88 Mich. L. Rev. 177 (1989). the Court could have killed Quill without first planting its constitutional kiss of death.63× 63. Cf. Thomas R. Lee, Stare Decisis in Historical Perspective: From the Founding Era to the Rehnquist Court, 52 Vand. L. Rev. 647, 704 (1999) (“Justice Brandeis’ . . . memorable prose has since become a mandatory part of the burial rite for any constitutional precedent.”).
The Court resisted such arguments. Instead, Wayfair reasoned that Congress’s total ability to correct an erroneous decision counts for nothing when the Court gets the Constitution wrong. That such a theory sprouts from a case like Wayfair, which repudiated a “formalistic distinction,”64× 64. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2092. is ironic. Wayfair’s stare decisis analysis resorts to the formalism of making constitutional a “magic” word65× 65. See Transcript of Oral Argument, supra note 21, at 12. rather than asking whether Congress can step in.
Moreover, the Court’s new thinking on stare decisis threatens other constitutional default rules. Wayfair now stands for the proposition that a “constitutional default rule” — a term the Court apparently lifted from South Dakota’s reply brief on the merits66× 66. Reply Brief at 22, Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. 2080 (No. 17-494) (“Congress is polarized, which makes it critical . . . to get the constitutional default rule right.”). — gets only weakened stare decisis. To appreciate why this holding matters, it is worth exploring the concept and scope of constitutional default rules. Contract theory describes default rules as legal rules that the parties may “contract around.”67× 67. See, e.g., Ian Ayres & Robert Gertner, Filling Gaps in Incomplete Contracts: An Economic Theory of Default Rules, 99 Yale L.J. 87, 87 (1989). Although “constitutional default rule” could be read broadly to include a variety of actors and contracting mechanisms,68× 68. See John Ferejohn & Barry Friedman, Toward a Political Theory of Constitutional Default Rules, 33 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 825, 826 (2006) (“When we speak of default rules in constitutional law, we typically are talking about specifications of ways the government can act (or modify its behavior) to get around a constitutional prohibition.”). the Court’s use of the term for purposes of stare decisis may be narrowly defined as judicial precedents of constitutional law that “are ultimately subject to congressional control.”69× 69. Gillian E. Metzger, Congress, Article IV, and Interstate Relations, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 1468, 1525 (2007) (describing judicially enforceable “constitutional default rules imposing obligations on the states in the name of union [that] are ultimately subject to congressional control”). The dormant commerce clause is a paradigmatic constitutional default rule because what the Court does today Congress may undo tomorrow. Justice Scalia declared this fact “[t]he clearest sign that the negative Commerce Clause is a judicial fraud,” for “[h]ow could congressional consent lift a constitutional prohibition?”70× 70. Comptroller of the Treasury of Md. v. Wynne, 135 S. Ct. 1787, 1808 (2015) (Scalia, J., dissenting). But that’s what a constitutional default rule is. The Court has allowed Congress to overturn its dormant commerce clause cases since 1891.71× 71. See In re Rahrer, 140 U.S. 545, 560–62 (1891).
Dormant commerce clause cases are not the only constitutional default rules. Professor Laurence Tribe’s treatise identifies two others.72× 72. 1 Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 6-35 (3d ed. 2000). And in a groundbreaking article, Professor Henry Monaghan revealed “a substructure of substantive, procedural, and remedial rules” forming “a constitutional common law subject to amendment, modification, or even reversal by Congress.”73× 73. Henry P. Monaghan, The Supreme Court, 1974 Term — Foreword: Constitutional Common Law, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 2–3 (1975); see also Susan R. Klein, Identifying and (Re)Formulating Prophylactic Rules, Safe Harbors, and Incidental Rights in Constitutional Criminal Procedure, 99 Mich. L. Rev. 1030 (2001) (further developing Monaghan’s theory in criminal procedure context). What follows is a list of six lines of cases beyond the dormant commerce clause that may be fairly described as constitutional default rules. The first two are drawn from Tribe’s treatise while the next four are found in Monaghan’s article:
(1) State Taxation of Federal Instrumentalities: States may not tax instrumentalities of the federal government74× 74. McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 436 (1819). — unless Congress consents.75× 75. See, e.g., Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U.S. 405, 411 n.1 (1938) (“Congress may curtail an immunity which might otherwise be implied or enlarge it beyond the point where, Congress being silent, the Court would set its limits.” (citations omitted)). One court has described such judicial decisions as setting a “constitutional default rule.” United States v. Delaware, 958 F.2d 555, 560 n.9 (3d Cir. 1992) (“[W]e must decide the constitutional default rule for this type of tax, fully aware that Congress could decide at any time to reverse our decision statutorily.”). (2) Article I, Section 10 Cases: Article I, Section 10 provides that certain prohibitions on the states may be waived by Congress.76× 76. See U.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cls. 2–3. The Court has taken note of this when considering whether to overrule, for instance, an Import-Export Clause precedent.77× 77. See Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, 324 U.S. 652, 668 (1945) (“In view of the fact that the Constitution gives Congress authority to consent to state taxation of imports and hence to lay down its own test for determining when the immunity ends, we see no convincing practical reason for abandoning the test which has been applied for more than a century . . . .”), overruled on other grounds by Limbach v. Hooven & Allison Co., 466 U.S. 353 (1984). In Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U.S. 276 (1976), the Court left open the question whether “Congress may authorize, under the Import-Export Clause, an exaction that it could not directly impose under the Tax Clause.” Id. at 301 n.13. Metzger, however, argues that the Import-Export Clause is free of other clauses’ limits on congressional power. See Metzger, supra note 69, at 1500 & n.120. (3) Bivens Cases: In Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics,78× 78. 403 U.S. 388 (1971). the Court held that a violation of the Fourth Amendment gives rise to a right to sue for damages.79× 79. Id. at 397. But the Court has also held that “[s]uch a cause of action may be defeated . . . when . . . Congress has provided an alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be a substitute for recovery directly under the Constitution and viewed as equally effective.”80× 80. Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 18–19 (1980). (4) Miranda Cases: The Miranda Court famously “encourage[d]” Congress and the states to explore alternative “procedures which are at least as effective in apprising accused persons of their right of silence and in assuring a continuous opportunity to exercise it.”81× 81. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 467 (1966). In Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428 (2000), the Court struck down a congressional attempt to effectively abolish Miranda, holding that “Miranda announced a constitutional rule that Congress may not supersede legislatively.” Id. at 444. But Dickerson also stood by Miranda’s “invitation for legislative action” to replace Miranda with an adequate substitute. Id. at 440; see also Michael C. Dorf & Barry Friedman, Shared Constitutional Interpretation, 2000 Sup. Ct. Rev. 61 (discussing legislative alternatives to Miranda). (5) The Police Lineup Case: In United States v. Wade,82× 82. 388 U.S. 218 (1967). the Court created an exclusionary rule for evidence obtained from a police lineup in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel but acknowledged that it could be replaced by “[l]egislative or other regulations . . . which eliminate the risks of abuse.”83× 83. Id. at 239. (6) The Exclusionary Rule Cases: Mapp v. Ohio made the Fourth Amendment “exclusionary rule” binding on the states,84× 84. 367 U.S. 643, 655 (1961). yet Congress is thought to have the power to replace it.85× 85. See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 422–24 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (inviting Congress to replace the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule); Harold J. Krent, How to Move Beyond the Exclusionary Rule: Structuring Judicial Response to Legislative Reform Efforts, 26 Pepp. L. Rev. 855, 864–71 (1999).
All of the above are arguably constitutional default rules set by the Court that remain, to one degree or another, open to congressional revision. The list could be longer or shorter, depending on which default rules the Court will view as constitutional86× 86. A shorter list could be produced by whittling away at the constitutional status of the cases identified by Monaghan. While the Court has held that Miranda is a constitutional decision, Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 444, some of the other cases may be viewed as nonconstitutional. See, e.g., Collins v. Virginia, 138 S. Ct. 1663, 1675–80 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring) (arguing that Mapp is “nonconstitutional,” id. at 1678 n.5); Richard H. Fallon, Jr. et al., Hart and Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 775–77 (7th ed. 2015) (discussing whether Bivens is constitutionally required). Conversely, a longer list might include any constitutional right that can be waived by a party. See, e.g., Daniel A. Farber, Another View of the Quagmire: Unconstitutional Conditions and Contract Theory, 33 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 913, 918 (2006) (describing the Eleventh Amendment as “just a contractual default rule that the states are free to barter away”). Such a list might also include various constitutionally inspired judicial presumptions. See, e.g., Jack Goldsmith & John F. Manning, The President’s Completion Power, 115 Yale L.J. 2280, 2299 (2006) (describing the Chevron presumption of delegated interpretive power to administrative agencies as “a constitutionally inspired default rule”); Nicholas Quinn Rosenkranz, Federal Rules of Statutory Interpretation, 115 Harv. L. Rev. 2085, 2097–98 (2002) (describing clear statement rules as “constitutional default rules” reversible by Congress). Many other decisions could likely be characterized as constitutional default rules; the list above is only an initial stab. and on how it will answer open questions about congressional authority over certain constitutional provisions.87× 87. See, e.g., Thomas v. Wash. Gas Light Co., 448 U.S. 261, 272 n.18 (1980) (plurality opinion) (leaving unresolved whether Congress may limit constitutional full faith and credit obligations); White v. Mass. Council of Constr. Emp’rs, Inc., 460 U.S. 204, 215 n.1 (1983) (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (leaving unresolved “whether Congress may authorize . . . what otherwise would be a violation” of the Privileges and Immunities Clause); 1 Tribe, supra note 72, § 6-35, at 1243–44 (arguing that Congress cannot override judicial constructions of the Privileges and Immunities Clause); Metzger, supra note 69, at 1486–89 (arguing the opposite). But the takeaway is clear: weaker stare decisis for constitutional default rules. Pre-Wayfair, one would have thought that stare decisis applies with special force to such precedents, given congressional power to set them straight. Not anymore. Why? Because it is improper to “ask Congress to address a false constitutional premise of th[e] Court’s own creation.”88× 88. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096. The Latin for Wayfair’s doctrine is not stare decisis, which should reflect a realistic, working relationship between the legislative and judicial branches. It is mea culpa.
In its zeal to update the Constitution for “the Cyber Age,”89× 89. Id. at 2097. the Court deleted Congress from stare decisis doctrine in constitutional cases. The Court had better options. It could have left Quill on Congress’s doorstep, as the dissent argued. Or it could have justified overruling Quill notwithstanding the special force of stare decisis. Instead, the Court reasoned that it doesn’t matter whether Congress is willing and able to do the job: a constitutional mess calls for a judicial clean-up crew. For constitutional default rules — a category of decisions embracing the dormant commerce clause and sweeping far beyond — Wayfair’s new theory of stare decisis makes the Court’s precedents less sticky and Congress less relevant.",['Quill harmed states more than anticipated due to the Internet.'],5429,multifieldqa_en,en,,e4725ed7b6df9933d5336f79d5c9d1d803a3e475831f1017," South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. is an odd and ominous development in stare decisis doctrine, writes Julian Zelizer. Zelizer: The Court has long thought that judicial junk is easier to scrap when the erroneous precedent cannot be fixed by Congress, as in constitutional cases. But Wayfair applied the weakened stare dec is of constitutional cases, Zelizer says. He says the Court's logic leads far past the dormant commerce clause in Wayfair to other precedents that set a “constitutional default rule” for state laws, such as the law in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 1260–1260 (1992) Zelizer writes: Other precedents setting constitutional default rules may be more vulnerable, including mainstays of criminal procedure like Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966) and Mapp v. Ohio, 643 (1961), and the Court has held that, under the “dormant” or “negative” implication of the Commerce Clause, it should take special force to dislodge such precedents, he says. The Court refused to overrule the Maryland Comptroller of the Treasury of the United States v. Wynne, 135 S. Ct. 1787, 1794 (2015), he writes. South Dakota law required remote sellers to collect and remit sales tax if the seller’s business in South Dakota comprised either a “gross revenue” greater than $100,000 or at least 200 “separate transactions” within one calendar year. After being sued by South Dakota for refusing to register for the newly required sales tax license, Wayfair, Inc., Overstock.com, and Newegg, Inc. moved for summary judgment. The South Dakota Supreme Court unanimously affirmed, recognizing that South Dakota's “arguments on the merits” may be “persuasive” but “Quill remains the controlling precedent.” The U.S. Supreme Court vacated the ruling and remanded the case for the last time for the Court to rule on the issue. Justices Thomas, Ginsburg, Alito and Ginsburg joined Justice Kennedy in the opinion vacated by the Supreme Court in the Wayfair v. State v. Wayfair Inc., 2017 SD 56, ¶¶ 9–11, 901 N.W.2d 754, 759–60 (2017) (S.C.L.A. Rev. 2089), 2089-2089 (Rev. L.A.) (2018) Quill “serve[d] as a judicially created tax shelter’ for remote retailers. The rule deprived the states of billions of dollars, since they could not force remote sellers to collect the tax and consumers hardly ever paid it on their own. The Court remanded the case to the South Dakota courts to determine in the first instance “whether some other principle in the Court’s Commerce Clause doctrine might invalidate the Act’” Justices Thomas and Gorsuch each filed concurring opinions. Chief Justice Roberts dissented, and Justice Justices Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan joined the Chief Justice's dissent. The dissent turned entirely on the principles and application of the dispute between the majority and the dissent, Justice Breyer said. The Justices agreed that Bellas Hess was wrongly decided, but “the Internet revolution has made [Quill’S] earlier error all the more egregious and harmful,” he said. “The entire negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence” is wrong and should be abandoned, Justice Thomas added, adding that the “Court” “should have joined [Justice White”‘s dissenting] opinion’. Chief Justice Roberts argued that whether or how to reverse Quill should be left to Congress. In Bellas Hess, the Court reasoned that the dormant commerce clause protects interstate business from being “entangle[d]... in a virtual welter of complicated obligations to local jurisdictions.” In Wayfair, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that a “heightened form of stare decisis’ applies when “Congress can, if it wishes, override this Court’s decisions with contrary legislation’” The Court acknowledged that “[c]omplex state tax systems could have the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce,” 138 S. Ct. at 2099 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). The dispute in Wayfair over whether software is up to the task effectively reprised the old debate from Bellas. Hess, only this time couched as part of the stare dec isis inquiry's concern for reliance interests rather than as a matter of dormant Commerce clause doctrine. The Court could have overruled a precedent that could have been overruled by Congress by ruling that Congress could not override a precedent set by the Supreme Court. It could also have ruled that Congress can’t “change the ground rules’ in a way that the Court may have way have way” The Court’s reasoning in Wayfair departs from its prior stare decisis analysis. In 1932, Justice Brandeis posited that stare Decisis must bend “in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible” The Court has long since adopted his argument, e.g., Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 665 (1944). Yet the Wayfair majority refused to consider Congress”s authority to legislate as a relevant factor for stare dec isis. This refusal breaks from the practical Brande isian wisdom that has guided the Court” s treatment of precedent for the better part of a century, says Brian Galle, Killle, and Essay, Dormant Commerce Clause: Lessons on Congressional Control of State Taxation, 70–62 L. Rev. L.J. (158–62), 158–3 L.Rev. L, 158–62, 160–3, 158-3, 160-4, 158,158,158-3. For two practical arguments to this effect, see Killle and Killle. For a practical argument to keep Quill, see Essay and Killay, Keep Dormants Commerce Clause. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. 2080 (No. 17-494), ruled that Congress can’t step in when a court rules in favor of a state. David Frum: The Court could have discussed the limits of the states’ influence in the federal system. He says it could have argued that new facts on the ground — namely, the blast of e-commerce that hit like a comet after Quill — overpowered stare decisis of any force, special or plain.Frum: Wayfair now stands for the proposition that a “constitutional default rule’ — a term the Court apparently lifted from South Dakota’s reply brief on the merits — gets only weakened in this case. It is ironic that such a theory sprouts from a case like Wayfair, which repudiated a ‘formalistic distinction,’ Frum says, and that it threatens other constitutional default rules as well as the ‘magic’ word ‘constitutional.’ ‘Constitutional default rules’ may be read broadly to include a variety of actors and contracting mechanisms, Frum writes, and could be read to include ‘contract’ and ‘constitution’ The dormant commerce clause is a paradigmatic constitutional default rule. What the Court does today Congress may undo tomorrow. Professor Laurence Tribe’s treatise identifies two other constitutional default rules. The Court has taken note of this when considering whether to overrule, for instance, an Import-Export Clause precedent. See, e.g., Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U.S. 405, 411 n.1 (1938) (“Congress may curtail an immunity which might otherwise be implied or enlarge it beyond the point where, Congress being silent, the Court would set its limits”). See In re Rahrer, 140 U. s. 545, 560–62 (1891). See McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.s. (4 Wheat.) 316, 436 (1819). — unless Congress consents. (2) Article I, Section 10 Cases: Article I,. Section 10 provides that certain prohibitions on the states may be waived by Congress. See Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, 652, 653 (1945) — the Court left open the fact that the Constitution gives Congress authority to lay down its own test for determining immunity. (3) State Taxation of Federal Instrumentalities: States may not tax instrumentalities of the federal government. 78× 78. Metzger argues that the Import-Export Clause is free of other clauses’ limits on congressional power. (3) Bivens Cases: The Miranda Court famously “encourage[d]” Congress and the states to explore alternative “procedures which are at least as effective” in apprising accused persons of their right of silence. (4) The Police Lineup Case: In United States v. Wade, the Court created an exclusionary rule for evidence obtained from a police lineup in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. (5) The Exclusionary Rule Cases: Mapp v. Ohio made the Fourth Amendment “exclusionary rule” binding on the states,84× 84. Yet Congress is thought to have the power to replace it.85× 85. The list could be longer or shorter, depending on which default rules the Court will view as constitutional86× 86. A shorter list couldbe produced by whittling away at the constitutional status of the cases identified by Monaghan. Conversely, a longer list might include any constitutional right required by a party that can be waived by a judicial ruling. See, e.g., Jack Goldsmith, The Unconstitutional Conditions and Theory, 33 Fla. St. L. Rev. 913, 913 (2006) In Wayfair, the Court deleted Congress from stare decisis doctrine in constitutional cases. The Latin for Wayfair’s doctrine is not stareDecisis, it is mea culpa. The Court had better options. It could have left Quill on Congress's doorstep, as the dissent argued. Instead, it reasoned that it doesn’t matter whether Congress is willing and able to do the job: a constitutional mess calls for a judicial clean-up crew. For constitutional default rules — a category of decisions embracing the dormant commerce clause and sweeping far beyond — Wayfair's new theory of stare Decisis makes the Court's precedents less sticky and Congress less relevant. It is improper to “ask Congress to address a false constitutional premise of th[e] Court's own creation.”"

abstract

The evolutionary balance between innate and learned behaviors is highly intricate, and different organisms have found different solutions to this problem. We hypothesize that the emergence and exact form of learning behaviors is naturally connected with the statistics of environmental fluctuations and tasks an organism needs to solve.
Here, we study how different aspects of simulated environments shape an evolved synaptic plasticity rule in static and moving artificial agents. We demonstrate that environmental fluctuation and uncertainty control the reliance of artificial organisms on plasticity. Interestingly, the form of the emerging plasticity rule is additionally determined by the details of the task the artificial organisms are aiming to solve.
Moreover, we show that coevolution between static connectivity and interacting plasticity mechanisms in distinct sub-networks changes the function and form of the emerging plasticity rules in embodied agents performing a foraging task. One of the defining features of living organisms is their ability to adapt to their environment and incorporate new information to modify their behavior.
It is unclear how the ability to learn first evolved , but its utility appears evident. Natural environments are too complex for all the necessary information to be hardcoded genetically and more importantly, they keep changing during an organism's lifetime in ways that cannot be anticipated ; . The link between learning and environmental uncertainty and fluctuation has been extensively demonstrated in both natural ; , and artificial environments .
Nevertheless, the ability to learn does not come without costs. For the capacity to learn to be beneficial in evolutionary terms, a costly nurturing period is often required, a phenomenon observed in both biological , and artificial organisms . Additionally, it has been shown that in some complex environments, hardcoded behaviors may be superior to learned ones given limits in the agent's lifetime and envi-ronmental uncertainty ; ; .
The theoretical investigation of the optimal balance between learned and innate behaviors in natural and artificial systems goes back several decades. However, it has recently found also a wide range of applications in applied AI systems ; . Most AI systems are trained for specific tasks, and have no need for modification after their training has been completed.
Still, technological advances and the necessity to solve broad families of tasks make discussions about life-like AI systems relevant to a wide range of potential application areas. Thus the idea of open-ended AI agents that can continually interact with and adapt to changing environments has become particularly appealing.
Many different approaches for introducing lifelong learning in artificial agents have been proposed. Some of them draw direct inspiration from actual biological systems ; . Among them, the most biologically plausible solution is to equip artificial neural networks with some local neural plasticity , similar to the large variety of synaptic plasticity mechanisms ; ; that performs the bulk of the learning in the brains of living organisms .
The artificial plasticity mechanisms can be optimized to modify the connectivity of the artificial neural networks toward solving a particular task. The optimization can use a variety of approaches, most commonly evolutionary computation. The idea of meta-learning or optimizing synaptic plasticity rules to perform specific functions has been recently established as an engineering tool that can compete with stateof-the-art machine learning algorithms on various complex tasks ; ; Pedersen and Risi (2021); .
Additionally, it can be used to reverse engineer actual plasticity mechanisms found in biological neural networks and uncover their functions ; . Here, we study the effect that different factors (environ-arXiv:2303.06734v1 [q-bio.NC] 12 Mar 2023 mental fluctuation and reliability, task complexity) have on the form of evolved functional reward-modulated plasticity rules.
We investigate the evolution of plasticity rules in static, single-layer simple networks. Then we increase the complexity by switching to moving agents performing a complex foraging task. In both cases, we study the impact of different environmental parameters on the form of the evolved plasticity mechanisms and the interaction of learned and static network connectivity.
Interestingly, we find that different environmental conditions and different combinations of static and plastic connectivity have a very large impact on the resulting plasticity rules. We imagine an agent who must forage to survive in an environment presenting various types of complex food particles. Each food particle is composed of various amounts and combinations of N ingredients that can have positive (food) or negative (poison) values.
The value of a food particle is a weighted sum of its ingredients. To predict the reward value of a given resource, the agent must learn the values of these ingredients by interacting with the environment. The priors could be generated by genetic memory, but the exact values are subject to change. To introduce environmental variability, we stochastically change the values of the ingredients.
More precisely, we define two ingredient-value distributions E 1 and E 2 and switch between them, with probability p tr for every time step. We control how (dis)similar the environments are by parametrically setting E 2 = (1 − 2d e )E 1 , with d e ∈ [0, 1] serving as a distance proxy for the environments; when d e = 0, the environment remains unchanged, and when d e = 1 the value of each ingredient fully reverses when the environmental transition happens.
For simplicity, we take values of the ingredients in E 1 equally spaced between -1 and 1 (for the visualization, see Fig. ). The static agent receives passively presented food as a vector of ingredients and can assess its compound value using the linear summation of its sensors with the (learned or evolved) weights, see Fig. .
The network consists of N sensory neurons that are projecting to a single post-synaptic neuron. At each time step, an input X t = (x 1 , . . . , x N ) is presented, were the value x i , i ∈ {1, . . . , N } represents the quantity of the ingredient i. We draw x i independently form a uniform distribution on the [0, 1] interval (x i ∼ U (0, 1)).
The value of each ingredient w c i is determined by the environment (E 1 or E 2 ). The postsynaptic neuron outputs a prediction of the food X t value as y t = g(W X T t ). Throughout the paper, g will be either the identity function, in which case the prediction neuron is linear, or a step-function; however, it could be any other nonlinearity, such as a sigmoid or ReLU.
After outputting the prediction, the neuron receives feedback in the form of the real value of the input R t . The real value is computed as R t = W c X T t + ξ, where W c = (w c 1 , . . . , w c N ) is the actual value of the ingredients, and ξ is a term summarizing the noise of reward and sensing system ξ ∼ N (0, σ).
Figure : An outline of the static agent's network. The sensor layer receives inputs representing the quantity of each ingredient of a given food at each time step. The agent computes the prediction of the food's value y t and is then given the true value R t ; it finally uses this information in the plasticity rule to update the weight matrix.
For the evolutionary adjustment of the agent's parameters, the loss of the static agent is the sum of the mean squared errors (MSE) between its prediction y t and the reward R t over the lifetime of the agent. The agent's initial weights are set to the average of the two ingredient value distributions, which is the optimal initial value for the case of symmetric switching of environments that we consider here.
As a next step, we incorporate the sensory network of static agents into embodied agents that can move around in an environment scattered with food. To this end, we merge the static agent's network with a second, non-plastic motor network that is responsible for controlling the motion of the agent in the environment.
Specifically, the original plastic network now provides the agent with information about the value of the nearest food. The embodied agent has additional sensors for the distance from the nearest food, the angle between the current velocity and the nearest food direction, its own velocity, and its own energy level (sum of consumed food values).
These inputs are processed by two hidden layers (of 30 and 15 neurons) with tanh activation. The network's outputs are angular and linear acceleration, Fig. . The embodied agents spawn in a 2D space with periodic boundary conditions along with a number of food particles that are selected such that the mean of the food value distribution is ∼ 0. An agent can eat food by approaching it sufficiently closely, and each time a food particle is eaten, it is The sensor layer receives inputs at each time step (the ingredients of the nearest food), which are processed by the plastic layer in the same way as the static sensory network, Fig. .
The output of that network is given as input to the motor network, along with the distance d and angle α to the nearest food, the current velocity v, and energy E of the agent. These signals are processed through two hidden layers to the final output of motor commands as the linear and angular acceleration of the agent re-spawned with the same value somewhere randomly on the grid (following the setup of ).
After 5000 time steps, the cumulative reward of the agent (the sum of the values of all the food it consumed) is taken as its fitness. During the evolutionary optimization, the parameters for both the motor network (connections) and plastic network (learning rule parameters) are co-evolved, and so agents must simultaneously learn to move and discriminate good/bad food.
Reward-modulated plasticity is one of the most promising explanations for biological credit assignment . In our network, the plasticity rule that updates the weights of the linear sensor network is a rewardmodulated rule which is parameterized as a linear combination of the input, the output, and the reward at each time step:
Additionally, after each plasticity step, the weights are normalized by mean subtraction, an important step for the stabilization of Hebbian-like plasticity rules . We use a genetic algorithm to optimize the learning rate η p and amplitudes of different terms θ = (θ 1 , . . . , θ 8 ). The successful plasticity rule after many food presentations must converge to a weight vector that predicts the correct food values (or allows the agent to correctly decide whether to eat a food or avoid it).
To have comparable results, we divide θ = (θ 1 , . . . , θ 8 ) by We then multiply the learning rate η p with θ max to maintain the rule's evolved form unchanged, η norm p = η p • θ max . In the following, we always use normalized η p and θ, omitting norm . To evolve the plasticity rule and the moving agents' motor networks, we use a simple genetic algorithm with elitism .
The agents' parameters are initialized at random (drawn from a Gaussian distribution), then the sensory network is trained by the plasticity rule and finally, the agents are evaluated. After each generation, the bestperforming agents (top 10 % of the population size) are selected and copied into the next generation.
The remaining 90 % of the generation is repopulated with mutated copies of the best-performing agents. We mutate agents by adding independent Gaussian noise (σ = 0.1) to its parameters. To start with, we consider a static agent whose goal is to identify the value of presented food correctly. The static reward-prediction network quickly evolves the parameters of the learning rule, successfully solving the prediction task.
We first look at the evolved learning rate η p , which determines how fast (if at all) the network's weight vector is updated during the lifetime of the agents. We identify three factors that control the learning rate parameter the EA converges to: the distance between the environments, the noisiness of the reward, and the rate of environmental transition.
The first natural factor is the distance d e between the two environments, with a larger distance requiring a higher learning rate, Fig. . This is an expected result since the convergence time to the ""correct"" weights is highly dependent on the initial conditions. If an agent is born at a point very close to optimality, which naturally happens if the environments are similar, the distance it needs to traverse on the fitness landscape is small.
Therefore it can afford to have a small learning rate, which leads to a more stable convergence and is not affected by noise. A second parameter that impacts the learning rate is the variance of the rewards. The reward an agent receives for the plasticity step contains a noise term ξ that is drawn from a zero mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation σ.
This parameter controls the unreliability of the agent's sensory system, i.e., higher σ means that the information the agent gets about the value of the foods it consumes cannot be fully trusted to reflect the actual value of the foods. As σ increases, the learning rate η p decreases, which means that the more unreliable an environment becomes, the less an agent relies on plasticity to update its weights, Fig. .
Indeed for some combinations of relatively small distance d e and high reward variance σ, the EA converges to a learning rate of η p ≈ 0. This means that the agent opts to have no adaptation during its lifetime and remain at the mean of the two environments. It is an optimal solution when the expected loss due to ignoring the environmental transitions is, on average, lower than the loss the plastic network will incur by learning via the (often misleading because of the high σ) environmental cues.
A final factor that affects the learning rate the EA will converge to is the frequency of environmental change during an agent's lifetime. Since the environmental change is modeled as a simple, two-state Markov process (Fig. ), the control parameter is the transition probability p tr . When keeping everything else the same, the learning rate rapidly rises as we increase the transition probability from 0, and after reaching a peak, it begins to decline slowly, eventually reaching zero (Fig. ).
This means that when environmental transition is very rare, agents opt for a very low learning rate, allowing a slow and stable convergence to an environment-appropriate weight vector that leads to very low losses while the agent remains in that environment. As the rate of environmental transition increases, faster learning is required to speed up convergence in order to exploit the (comparatively shorter) stays in each environment.
Finally, as the environmental transition becomes too fast, the agents opt for slower or even no learning, which keeps them ) and the decision (b.) tasks, for a variety of parameters (p tr = 0.01, d e ∈ 0, 0.1, . . . , 1, and σ ∈ 0, 0.1, . . . , 1 in all 100 combinations). Despite the relatively small difference between the tasks, the evolved learning rules differ considerably.
For visual guidance, the lines connect θs from the same run. near the middle of the two environments, ensuring that the average loss of the two environments is minimal (Fig. ). The form of the evolved learning rule depends on the task: Decision vs. Prediction The plasticity parameters θ = (θ 1 , . . . , θ 8 ) for the rewardprediction task converge on approximately the same point, regardless of the environmental parameters (Fig. ).
In particular, θ 3 → 1, θ 5 → −1, θ i → 0 for all other i, and thus the learning rule converges to: Since by definition y t = g(W t X T t ) = W t X T t (g(x) = x in this experiment) and R t = W c X T t + ξ we get: Thus the distribution of ∆W t converges to a distribution with mean 0 and variance depending on η p and σ and W converges to W c .
So this learning rule will match the agent's weight vector with the vector of ingredient values in the environment. We examine the robustness of the learning rule the EA discovers by considering a slight modification of our task. Instead of predicting the expected food value, the agent now needs to decide whether to eat the presented food or not.
This is done by introducing a step-function nonlinearity (g(x) = 1 if x ≥ 1 and 0 otherwise). Then the output y(t) is computed as: Instead of the MSE loss between prediction and actual value, the fitness of the agent is now defined as the sum of the food values it chose to consume (by giving y t = 1). Besides these two changes, the setup of the experiments remains exactly the same.
The qualitative relation between η p and parameters of environment d e , σ and p tr is preserved in the changed experiment. However, the resulting learning rule is significantly different (Fig. ). The evolution converges to the following learning rule: In both cases, the rule has the form ∆W t = η p X t [α y R t + β y ].
Thus, the ∆W t is positive or negative depending on whether the reward R t is above or below a threshold (γ = −β y /α y ) that depends on the output decision of the network (y t = 0 or 1). Both learning rules (for the reward-prediction and decision tasks) have a clear Hebbian form (coordination of preand post-synaptic activity) and use the incoming reward signal as a threshold.
These similarities indicate some common organizing principles of reward-modulated learning rules, but their significant differences highlight the sensitivity of the optimization process to task details. We now turn to the moving embodied agents in the 2D environment. To optimize these agents, both the motor network's connections and the sensory network's plasticity parameters evolve simultaneously.
Since the motor network is initially random and the agent has to move to find food, the number of interactions an agent experiences in its lifetime can be small, slowing down the learning. However, having the larger motor network also has benefits for evolution because it allows the output of the plastic network to be read out and transformed in different ways, resulting in a broad set of solutions.
The fitness of an agent (measured as the total food consumed over its lifetime) increases over generations of the EA for both the scalar and binary readouts in the sensory network. e. The Pearson correlation coefficient of an evolved agent's weights with the ingredient value vector of the current environment (E 1 -blue, E 2 -red).
In this example, the agent's weights are anti-correlated with its environment, which is not an issue for performance since the motor network can interpret the inverted signs of food. The agents can solve the task effectively by evolving a functional motor network and a plasticity rule that converges to interpretable weights (Fig. ).
After ∼ 100 evolutionary steps (Fig. ), the agents can learn the ingredient value distribution using the plastic network and reliably move towards foods with positive values while avoiding the ones with negative values. We compare the dependence of the moving and the static agents on the parameters of the environment: d e and the state transition probability p tr .
At first, in order to simplify the experiment, we set the transition probability to 0, but fixed the initial weights to be the average of E 1 and E 2 , while the real state is E 2 . In this experiment, the distance between states d e indicates twice the distance between the agent's initial weights and the optimal weights (the environment's ingredient values) since the agent is initialized at the mean of the two environment distributions.
Same as for the static agent, the learning rate increases with the distance d e (Fig. ). Then, we examine the effect of the environmental transition probability p tr on the evolved learning rate η p . In order for an agent to get sufficient exposure to each environment, we scale down the probability p tr from the equivalent experiment for the static agents.
We find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate η p decreases (Fig. ). This fits with the larger trend for the static agent, although there is a clear difference when it comes to the increase for very small transition probabil-ities that were clearly identifiable in the static but not the moving agents.
This could be due to much sparser data and possibly the insufficiently long lifetime of the moving agent (the necessity of scaling makes direct comparisons difficult). Nevertheless, overall we see that the associations observed in the static agents between environmental distance d e and transition probability p tr and the evolved learning rate η p are largely maintained in the moving agents.
Still, more data would be needed to make any conclusive assertions about the exact effect of these environmental parameters on the emerging plasticity mechanisms. A crucial difference between the static and the moving agents is the function the plasticity has to perform. While in the static agents, the plasticity has to effectively identify the exact value distribution of the environment in order to produce accurate predictions, in the embodied agents, the plasticity has to merely produce a representation of the environment that the motor network can evolve to interpret adequately enough to make decisions about which food to consume.
To illustrate the difference, we plot the Pearson correlation coefficient between an agent's weights and the ingredient values of the environment it is moving in (Fig. ). We use the correlation instead of the MSE loss (which we used for the static agents in Fig. ) because the amplitude of the vector varies a lot for different agents and meaningful The evolved parameters of moving agents' plasticity rule for the g(s) = x, identity (a.) and the step function (Eq.
4) (b.) sensory networks (the environmental parameters here are d e ∈ [0, 1], σ = 0 and p tr = 0.001). The step function (binary output) network evolved a more structured plasticity rule (e.g., θ 3 > 0 for all realizations) than the linear network. Moreover, the learned weights for the identity network (c.) have higher variance and correlate significantly less with the environment's ingredient distribution compared to the learned weights for the thresholded network (d.)
conclusions cannot be drawn from the MSE loss. For many agents, the learned weights are consistently anti-correlated with the actual ingredient values (an example of such an agent is shown in Fig. ). This means that the output of the sensory network will have the opposite sign from the actual food value.
While in the static network, this would lead to very bad predictions and high loss, in the foraging task, these agents perform exactly as well as the ones where the weights and ingredients values are positively correlated, since the motor network can simply learn to move towards food for which it gets a negative instead of a positive sensory input.
This additional step of the output of the plastic network going through the motor network before producing any behavior has a strong effect on the plasticity rules that the embodied agents evolve. Specifically, if we look at the emerging rules the top performing agents have evolved (Fig. ), it becomes clear that, unlike the very well-structured rules of the static agents (Fig. ), there is now virtually no discernible pattern or structure.
The difference becomes even clearer if we look at the learned weights (at the end of a simulation) of the best-performing agents (Fig. ). While there is some correlation with the environment's ingredient value distribution, the variance is very large, and they do not seem to converge on the ""correct"" values in any way.
This is to some extent expected since, unlike the static agents where the network's output has to be exactly correct, driving the evolution of rules that converge to the precise environmental distribution, in the embodied networks, the bulk of the processing is done by the motor network which can evolve to interpret the scalar value of the sensory network's output in a variety of ways.
Thus, as long as the sensory network's plasticity rule co-evolves with the motor network, any plasticity rule that learns to produce consistent information about the value of encountered food can potentially be selected. To further test this assumption, we introduce a bottleneck of information propagation between the sensory and motor networks by using a step-function nonlinearity on the output of the sensory network (Eq.
4). Similarly to the decision task of the static network, the output of the sensory network now becomes binary. This effectively reduces the flow of information from the sensory to the motor network, forcing the sensory network to consistently decide whether food should be consumed (with the caveat that the motor network can still interpret the binary sign in either of two ways, either consuming food marked with 1 or the ones marked with 0 by the sensory network).
The agents perform equally well in this variation of the task as before (Fig. ), but now, the evolved plasticity rules seem to be more structured (Fig. ). Moreover, the variance of the learned weights in the bestperforming agents is significantly reduced (Fig. ), which indicates that the bottleneck in the sensory network is in-creasing selection pressure for rules that learn the environment's food distribution accurately.
We find that different sources of variability have a strong impact on the extent to which evolving agents will develop neuronal plasticity mechanisms for adapting to their environment. A diverse environment, a reliable sensory system, and a rate of environmental change that is neither too large nor too small are necessary conditions for an agent to be able to effectively adapt via synaptic plasticity.
Additionally, we find that minor variations of the task an agent has to solve or the parametrization of the network can give rise to significantly different plasticity rules. Our results partially extend to embodied artificial agents performing a foraging task. We show that environmental variability also pushes the development of plasticity in such agents.
Still, in contrast to the static agents, we find that the interaction of a static motor network with a plastic sensory network gives rise to a much greater variety of wellfunctioning learning rules. We propose a potential cause of this degeneracy; as the relatively complex motor network is allowed to read out and process the outputs from the plastic network, any consistent information coming out of these outputs can be potentially interpreted in a behaviorally useful way.
Reducing the information the motor network can extract from the sensory system significantly limits learning rule variability. Our findings on the effect of environmental variability concur with the findings of previous studies that have identified the constraints that environmental variability places on the evolutionary viability of learning behaviors.
We extend these findings in a mechanistic model which uses a biologically plausible learning mechanism (synaptic plasticity). We show how a simple evolutionary algorithm can optimize the different parameters of a simple reward-modulated plasticity rule for solving simple prediction and decision tasks.
Reward-modulated plasticity has been extensively studied as a plausible mechanism for credit assignment in the brain ; ; and has found several applications in artificial intelligence and robotics tasks ; . Here, we demonstrate how such rules can be very well-tuned to take into account different environmental parameters and produce optimal behavior in simple systems.
Additionally, we demonstrate how the co-evolution of plasticity and static functional connectivity in different subnetworks fundamentally changes the evolutionary pressures on the resulting plasticity rules, allowing for greater diversity in the form of the learning rule and the resulting learned connectivity.
Several studies have demonstrated how, in biological networks, synaptic plasticity heavily interacts with and is driven by network topology . Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that biological plasticity mechanisms are highly redundant in the sense that any observed neural connectivity or recorded activity can be achieved with a variety of distinct, unrelated learning rules .
This observed redundancy of learning rules in biological settings complements our results and suggests that the function of plasticity rules cannot be studied independently of the connectivity and topology of the networks they are acting on. The optimization of functional plasticity in neural networks is a promising research direction both as a means to understand biological learning processes and as a tool for building more autonomous artificial systems.
Our results suggest that reward-modulated plasticity is highly adaptable to different environments and can be incorporated into larger systems that solve complex tasks. This work studies a simplified toy model of neural network learning in stochastic environments. Future work could be built on this basic framework to examine more complex reward distributions and sources of environmental variability.
Moreover, a greater degree of biological realism could be added by studying more plausible network architectures (multiple plastic layers, recurrent and feedback connections) and more sophisticated plasticity rule parametrizations. Additionally, our foraging simulations were constrained by limited computational resources and were far from exhaustive.
Further experiments can investigate environments with different constraints, food distributions, multiple seasons, more complex motor control systems and interactions of those systems with different sensory networks as well as the inclusion of plasticity on the motor parts of the artificial organisms.",['Environmental fluctuation and uncertainty control the reliance of artificial organisms on plasticity.'],5339,multifieldqa_en,en,,79ffdceb9859803e365c3de5d24c187ed06b15f04d04ae6a," Environmental variability and network structure determine the optimal plasticity mechanisms in embodied agents. A well-trained agent will approach and consume food with positive values (green dots) and avoid negative food (red dots) The learning rate of the plastic sensory network eta p grows with the distance between environments d e c and decreases with the frequency of environmental change. The fitness of an agent (measured as the total food consumed over its lifetime) increases over generations of the EA for both the scalar and binary readouts in the sensory network. The Pearson correlation coefficient of an evolved agent's weights with the ingredient value vector of the current environment (E 1 -blue, E 2 -red) is not an issue for performance since the motor network can interpret the inverted signs of food. For the capacity to learn to be beneficial in evolutionary terms, a costly nurturing period is often required, a phenomenon observed in both biological, and artificial organisms. It is unclear how the ability to learn first evolved, but its utility appears evident. In some complex environments, hardcoded behaviors may be superior to learned ones given limits in the agent's lifetime and envi-ronmental uncertainty. The idea of meta-learning or optimizing synaptic plasticity rules to perform specific functions has been recently established as an engineering tool that can compete with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms on various complex tasks. The plasticity mechanisms can be optimized to modify the connectivity of the artificial neural networks toward solving a particular task. We find that different environmental conditions and different combinations of static and plastic connectivity have a very large impact on the resulting plasticityRules. We imagine an agent who must forage to survive in an environment presenting various types of complex food particles. Each food particle is composed of various amounts and combinations of N ingredients that can have positive (food) or negative (poison) values. The priors could be generated by genetic memory, but the exact values are subject to change. To introduce environmental variability, we stochastically change the values of the ingredients. gent receives passively presented food as a vector of ingredients and can assess its compound value using the linear summation of its sensors with the (learned or evolved) weights. The network consists of N sensory neurons that are projecting to a single post-synaptic neuron. The agent computes the prediction of the food's value y t and is then given the true value R t. An agent can eat food by approaching it sufficiently closely, and each time a food particle is eaten, it is given a reward. The embodied agent has additional sensors for the distance from the nearest food, the angle between the current velocity and the nearby food direction, its own velocity, and its own energy level. These signals are processed through two hidden layers to the final output of motor commands as the linear and angular acceleration of the agent re-spawned with the same value somewhere randomly on the grid (following the setup of).After 5000 time steps, the cumulative reward of theAgent (the sum of the values of all the food it consumed) is taken as its fitness. During the evolutionary optimization, the parameters for both network (connections) and plastic network (learning rule parameters) are co-evolved. Reward-modulated plasticity is one of the most promising explanations for biological credit assignment. To evolve the plasticity rule and the moving agents' motor networks, we use a simple genetic algorithm with elitism. We identify three factors that control the learning rate parameter the EA converges to: the distance between the environments, the noisiness of the reward, and the rate of environmental transition. After each generation, the bestperforming agents (top 10 % of the population size) are selected and copied into the next generation. The remaining 90% of the generation is repopulated with mutated copies of the best-performing agents. We mutate agents by adding independent Gaussian noise (σ = 0.1) to its parameters. The reward an agent receives contains a noise term ξ that is drawn from a zero mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation σ. This parameter controls the unreliability of the agent's sensory system, i.e., higher σ means that the information the agent gets about the value of the foods it consumes cannot be fully trusted to reflect the actual value. A final factor that affects the learning rate the EA will converge to is the frequency of environmental change during an agent's lifetime. When environmental transition is very rare, agents opt for a very low learning rate, allowing a slow and stable convergence to an environment-appropriate weight vector. As the rate of environmental transition increases, faster learning is required to speed up convergence in order to exploit the (comparatively shorter) stays in each environment. The form of the evolved learning rule depends on the task: Decision vs. Prediction. We examine the robustness of the learning rule the EA discovers by considering a slight modification of our task. Instead of predicting the expected food value, the agent now needs to decide whether to eat the presented food or not. The evolution converges to the following learning rule: In both cases, the rule has the form ∆W t = η p X t [α y R t + β y ]. The similarities indicate some common organizing principles of reward-modulated learning, but their significant differences highlight the sensitivity of the optimization process to task details. We turn to the moving agents in the 2D environment. To optimize these, both the motor network's connections and the sensory network's p. plastic network will incur by learning via the (often misleading because of the high σ) environmental cues. asticity parameters evolve simultaneously. The agents can solve the task effectively by evolving a functional motor network and a plasticity rule that converges to interpretable weights. After 100 evolutionary steps, the agents can learn the ingredient value distribution using the plastic network and reliably move towards foods with positive values while avoiding the ones with negative values. We compare the dependence of the moving and the static agents on the parameters of the environment: d e and the state transition probability p tr. We find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate η p decreases in the moving agents. However, there is a clear difference when it comes to the increase for very small transition probabil-ities that were clearly identifiable in the static but not the moving agent. More data would be needed to make any conclusive assertions about the exact effect of these environmental parameters on the emerging plasticity mechanisms, we say. We conclude that the associations observed in thestatic agents between environmental distance d e. and transition probabilities p tr are largely maintained in the moved agents. The step function (binary output) network evolved a more structured plasticity rule than the linear network. For many agents, the learned weights are consistently anti-correlated with the actual ingredient values. This effectively reduces the flow of information from the sensory to the motor network, forcing the sensory network to consistently decide whether food should be consumed. We find that different sources of variability have a strong impact on the extent to which evolving agents will develop neuronal plasticity mechanisms for adapting to their environment. A diverse environment, a reliable sensory system, and a rate of environmental changings are key to the evolution of plasticity rules in the embodied agents. We conclude by showing that the best-performing agents are able to learn the environment's food distribution more accurately than the static agents, but that this is not a fully-fledged plasticity process. The results are published in the open-source version of the book, ""Evolutionary Plasticity in the Embodied Brain"" (Simon & Schuster, 2013). The interaction of a static motor network with a plastic sensory network gives rise to a much greater variety of wellfunctioning learning rules. The optimization of functional plasticity in neural networks is a promising research direction both as a means to understand biological learning processes and as a tool for building more autonomous artificial systems. The results suggest that reward-modulated plasticity is highly adaptable to different environments and can be incorporated into larger systems that solve complex tasks. Future work could be built on this basic framework to examine more complex reward distributions and sources of environmental variability. Further experiments can investigate environments with different constraints, food diaspora, and other factors that can affect learning in stochastic environments.

What is the problem encountered when building the fuselage sides?,"Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go ""perfectly."" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane.
This is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes.
While building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying ""banana"" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built.
First understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the ""projected"" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are ""foreshortened"" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to ""develop"" the ""true"" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat.
Second, understand that the dimensions called for in the plans put a twist in the sides that tends to work the panel in two directions of curvature. This twist makes the panel ""undevelopable"" meaning that that shape cannot be unrolled into an equivalent flat shape. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. To illustrate this, try forming a piece of paper around a soda can. The paper can be formed flat around the can either straight or at a diagonal to it's length. It has only one direction of curvature and is by definition ""developable"". Now try to form the same piece of paper around a baseball. It won't lie flat on the surface without some deformation (folding, wrinkling or tearing) of the paper. The ball has curvature in more that one direction and is a ""compounded"" shape. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain.
Initially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home), the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical shape firewall to tailstock.
This method borrows heavily from proven techniques used in the marine trades. It should be stressed at this point that although the layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time. If the layout is not going well initially, start over! Better to erase layout errors now than to have them built it and cause surprises later.
Layout to ensure a fair and true fuselage starts by drawing a reference line (baseline) on the building surface. Refer to figures 2 & 3 and use a wire guide to draw a very straight baseline. About 500 lbs. Of tension should be adequate. One could use a chalk line, but we're talking airplanes here, not house framing.
The main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Although the baseline will still be the reference, the top and bottom longerons will be laid separately.
Layout differences don't end there. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. Another major difference is that the bottom & side panels are applied after forming the fuselage box section. This is mainly to obtain the ability to ""fair"" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape.
Refer to figure 1 for the layout of the new developed side panel. The firewall (station a) is layed out perpendicular to the baseline. Longitudinal (station) measurements are given along the length of the baseline from the firewall. Vertical dimensions are given to reference the angle and breadths of the station at the baseline.
Notice that the top longeron is bowed outward and that the stations are spaced slightly greater than called out in the plans. When the panels are formed into the box frame section ,they will work into the dimensions specified in the plans.
Strike a centerline, longer than is needed on the building surface using a wire guide. Draw off the firewall line perpendicular to the centerline at one end.
Using the distances listed in the balloons, mark them off on the centerline. Distances are measured to the nearest sixteenth of an inch. Take time to mark them off carefully. Don't mark off the distances in a cumulative fashion. Use the firewall as a common reference.
Using the angles listed at each station, mark off a station line longer than is needed. The angles are measured to the nearest hundredth of a degree. Take time to mark them off carefully.
At each station, start by marking off each short (bottom longeron) line distance from the centerline. Use your set of trammels or beam compass for doing this. Mark the intersection of the short line with the station line.
At each station, mark off each long (top longeron) line distance from the intersection of the short line distance and the station line. Again the trammels or beam compass is best for completing this step. Mark the intersection of the long line distance with the station line.
Using the longeron as a batten, trace out the inside and outside curves of the longeron. After the batten is secure, in between each station, fasten a keeper block inside and outside to preserve the shape of the longeron taking care to avoid potential future interference with the diagonal members to be installed later. The fairing blocks can be removed or left in place if they won't interfere with building. The vertical station members and their diagonals can now be measured and positioned. Remember to refer to the plans for the material thickness direction.
After vertical and diagonal members are cut and fitted, take time to draw their outlines on the building surface to cut down on time and confusion when laying out the opposite side.
Finishing the side panel is accomplished in a manner similar to that called for in the handbook with the exception that the side and bottom skin panels will be attached later.
The next article in the series will discuss jigging and building techniques to ensure alignment and straightness of the flat built side panels. Also covered will be building a ""strongback"" jig to assure alignment of the side panels when they are formed into their final shape.
Part 3 in the series will cover assembly of the side panels using the jigs. Some joint details will be discussed that will ensure a stronger and more fair fuselage assembly. Also covered will be the layout & attachment of the side and bottom ply skins.

""Scarfing"" is the practice of splicing plywood so that short pieces of plywood can be used to span long distances. On the KR, it is required on both the fuselage skins and spar webs. The angle of the splice should be 10 to 12 degrees to maintain strength across the joint. Also, joints should coincide with structural members, such as spar webs or fuselage truss members.
This scarfer is made by mating a regular plunge router (this one costs about $50) to a table saw. Obviously, you really only need a table saw to cut the chamfer, but it does make a nice heavy table for scarfing. You could just as easily use a large work table as the base.First, set the table saw for a 5.5 degree cut (for a 1:12 joint, or 6.5 degree cut for a 10:1 joint), and run a 1 x 6 through on edge to chamfer a corner on the board. Then drill the board for three router mounting holes (two are countersunk) and connect the assembly to the table saw with two 1/4 inch bolts. Use a long (2-3 inch) straight cutting bit to do the cutting. Adjust the bit so it doesn't interfere with your table top, and go to town. Keep pressure on the plywood to ensure contact with the table while you're scarfing. Make sure you feed your material from the same end as you would if you were sawing, or the router will take your plywood away from you and put a big dent in your garage door.
In the late 60's Ken Rand and Stuart Robinson were working as flight system engineers for Douglas Avionics. Ken was working as an electrical engineer, having previously worked for Sperry as an autopilots project engineer, while Stu's degree was in aeronautical engineering from Northrop University. They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer.
They both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport.
Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79.
To date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2"" between firewall and main spar, and 14"" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts.
Mike Stearns addresses the KR Forum crowd.
This year's KR Forum featured guest speakers Mike Stearns, Steve Trentman, and Bill Marcey. Mike Stearns spoke on several topics, including the many sources for KR and homebuilding information available on the Internet. He also mentioned KRNet, the list server devoted entirely to KR aircraft, as well as several notable World Wide Web home pages. He also brought a sample of the new Rand Robinson wing skins with him, and discussed their high temperature core prepreg construction. His KR2S will receive the first set, which is currently being installed at Hinson Composites.
Steve Trentman spoke on his turbine installation. It uses a turbine engine which saw duty as an A7 attack jet starter engine. Total weight is about 85 pounds, while putting out around 90 horsepower. There is a small stockpile of these engines available from government surplus. sources. This engine can only be throttled back to 52% power, which leads to some pretty interesting landings. One inflight failure has been logged so far, with very little damage to the aircraft. More on this exciting development in next month's issue of KROnline.
Les Palmer's KR2 N202LP won Best KR2, Best Engine Installation, and People's Choice awards at the 1995 KR Gathering at Columbia, TN. After researching the KR series, and reading Neil Bingham's ""A Critical Analysis of the KR2"" (Jan 88 Sport Aviation), Les decided to build his as a single seater, stretched 24"" in the tail, while maintaining a stock width firewall. His fuselage is made from Douglas fir, which weighs in at 4 lbs heavier than if constructed from spruce. It is skinned with 1/8"" birch plywood. Spars are covered with plywoood on both fore and aft sides, ala KR2S. Diehl wing skins provide the lift. Horizontal stabilizer and elevator were stretched 7"" longer on each side, while the vertical stabilizer and rudder were stretched 8"" taller. . The fuselage to cowling junction was made more graceful by adding 1.5 inches to the height of the firewall end of the fuselage sides.
Les's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. The canopy frame fits snugly into a recess in the foward deck, providing an excellent wind and water seal. The fiberglass work is exemplary.
Seating is luxurious for one.
The cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. Female molds were made for all the fiberglass parts on Les's plane, so he could proabably be persuaded to make more, if demand dictates. Les also machines a multitude of KR aluminum and steel parts which he now offers for sale.
The firewall was reinforced with aluminum brackets and angles bolted between the longerons in anticipation of the 200 lb Subaru EA-81 engine installation. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Other than tapping the crank for larger bolts to mount the redrive, no other engine modifications were required. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy.
Originally built as a taildragger, the fixed gear is made from 4130 steel tubing. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6"" Cleveland calipers for braking. An early taxi test accident damaged the main gear, and prompted Les to change to tricycle gear. Again, he designed his own fiberglass main gear, and uses a Diehl nose wheel fork with a 4130 strut and 6"" wheel up front.
Early tests revealed cooling problems, which prompted a radiator move from the firewall to a lower cowling location.
The first flight was almost a disaster, as test pilot Randy Smith lost power right after takeoff. He managed a 180 with a safe downwind landing with only minor nosewheel pant damage. The culprit proved to be a spark plug with too much reach, which was quickly remedied. Subsequent flights have shown water temp to be about 210 degrees, oil temp is 220-230, and airspeed is about 180 mph.
Shopping for the Partially Built KR.
This story starts about twenty years ago when I first started looking at the KR-2 as the plane I'd like to build. The only problem at that time was a lack of money, lack of knowledge, and a lack of job stability. I liked the design, except for the low ground clearance of the retractable gear and that a KR was going to be a tight fit for me to fly.
Over the past twenty years I've owned a number of planes, but still always wanted to build my own. I needed one that would fit me, my budget requirements, and have the speed and performance that I wanted. When ""KITPLANES"" published the article featuring Roy Marsh's new KR-2S, it was the first I had heard of any major modifications or improvements to the same old KR design. I believe that article and Roy Marsh's workmanship have probably been the greatest boon to Rand Robinson (RR) in the last twenty years. It certainly caught my eye! Here was the same design I had decided I wanted to build twenty years ago, with all of the improvements I wanted. It was sitting on fixed gear with some reasonable ground clearance. It had the capability to be built large enough to accommodate me. It has enough prefab parts available that it didn't have to be 100% scratch built if I decided to hurry the project along. And it had the speed I wanted. I knew that Roy's published speeds were probably not realistic expectations for the average KR, but after knocking around for the last three years in my Champ, anything over 90 mph seems pretty fast to me.
After purchasing the info kit and the sales video from Rand Robinson, the next step after deciding for sure to build this plane was to order the KR-2 plans and the KR-2S addendum. I finally got my plans and was putting together my first order to start the plane, when my partner in the Champ pointed out that there was a partially completed KR-2S for sale in Trade-a-plane. My initial answer was ""No, I don't even want to look at it. I want to build my own from scratch."" My partner insisted that for the advertised price and the fact that it wasn't too far away, I ought to at least give the guy a call and investigate it. ""No, I don't think I want to buy someone else's problems,"" I persisted. That night I went home and crunched up some numbers on the calculator and finally came to the conclusion that for the sake of my budget for the next several years, I really should give this guy a call.
Three days later, I flew to his place about 400 miles away to take a look at his project. At this point I should probably mention that I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable about airplane construction, although the vast majority of my experience is with tube and fabric. The rest of this article deals with what I looked for and more importantly what I missed and have had to repair in the last year since I purchased the project.
When we went to the seller's house, I found that the left wing was built using the Dan Diehl wing skins and the right wing skins were leaning against the wall inside the house. Also the canopy was in the house with the canopy covered with paper and tape. I wanted to inspect the fuselage first, so off we went to the shop.
There I found a fuselage sitting on it's gear painted in primer gray. The first step was to inspect the quality of workmanship of what could be seen as it sat. The interior of the fuselage looked as if it had been built with a great deal of care. The fit and finish of all of the interior wood was very nice. Even the gussets looked like they had been painstakingly perfectly fitted. The glass work on the turtle back also looked very precise and clean. It was evenly faired into the vertical and horizontal stabs. The tail also appeared to be well built with the exception of a depression directly over the front and rear spars in the horizontal stabs. He explained that when he moved recently, that he had shot the plane with gray primer to protect it from the weather since he wouldn't have ready access to a shop to put it in right away. It ended up sitting out in the hot south Texas summer sun for a few weeks before he got a shop rented to work in. That caused the glass (or possibly the foam inside the horizontal stab) to swell, except that it held onto the spar, so it was slightly ballooned in front of and behind the spars. His recommendation was to fill it back smooth with micro.
I also found a small linear crack in the lower left wing spar cap on the left wing stub. It appeared to be from over tightening the rear spar wing attach fitting bolts. His explanation was that the crack wasn't important because the rear spars only job is to keep the wings from folding back. I also noticed that the holes for attaching the outer wing to the wing stub were badly rounded out on the rear spar. He explained that the Diehl wing skins require the rear spar to be swept slightly more forward than the stock wings. This won't allow you to use the rear spar attach fittings from RR and that I would need to fabricate a new set of rear spar attach fittings.
I also found that the aileron bellcranks were not built or installed as per plans, but found that they looked professional. I couldn't check for function since the right bellcrank and sheeve wasn't installed, the left wing also wasn't installed, and the right wing didn't exist yet.
Next we pulled the inspection panels off of the fuselage and tail and looked at everything I could see with a good flashlight. I didn't find anything else that might be questionable about the fuselage except for a cracked elevator trim tab that was damaged when it fell off it's hanging place on the wall.
Next we spent some time going over his builders log and builders photo album. I still hadn't seen anything that would dissuade me from buying this project.
At this point it was starting to get late and my ride down needed to get airborne for the flight home. I needed to make a decision about whether I wanted this project or not, but I hadn't inspected the wings and canopy yet. I took a cursory look at the left wing and saw lots on micro built up on it and some bubbles in the leading edge, but nothing that looked seriously wrong to my amateur eye. The right wing was only a set of spars in the shop and the Diehl wing skins in the house, so there wasn't much to look at there. The canopy was wrapped in paper and tape, so there wasn't much to look at there either. I decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the project. For the advertised price, I could build a new set of wings and still be way ahead financially. We negotiated a final price, shook hands, took my ride to the airport, and started off in search of a U-haul to haul the project home.
Now, at this point, some of you are thinking about what I surely must have forgotten to inspect and why didn't I take a local A & P or EAA member along for the ride. First of all, I don't know any mechanics locally that have any experience with glass and our EAA chapter of which I am VP is woefully lacking in fiberglass knowledge. Secondly, as you will see, I missed plenty. Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough.
Now for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with.
I found that the lower set of rear spar attach fittings on the left rear spar were installed backwards with the longer spaced hole towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Also in the same area he had drilled through the rear spar with a hole saw to create a place for the aileron cable to pass through and managed to cut out the second from the outside vertical brace in the spar. Then he chose to install the aileron bellcranks in front of the rear spar, and cut another hole through the rear spar for the aileron push rod. He also managed to cut out the outside vertical brace in the spar. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in, cut the whole rear spar carrythrough out of the fuselage including ruining the left lower wing skin, or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap and install a custom built set of attach fittings.
I also found that after I built and installed the right side wing stub ribs and skin that the aileron bellcrank setup would not work as installed. The cable that crosses between the two bellcranks had a sharp uphill from the sheeve to the bellcrank in the last 12 inches on either side. This combined with the radius that the bellcranks turn caused the cross cable to pull up tight when the ailerons were pushed to either end of their travel, but allowed the cables to go very slack when the ailerons were centered. Also the Aileron pushrods needed to pass directly through the lower set of rear wing attach fittings to attach to the aileron. This whole rear spar and aileron bellcrank setup was going to either have to be redesigned or cut out and built to plans. The bottom line is that the problems I observed when I inspected this part were much more serious than expected when I had to fix it.
I decided that I had to remove the rear fittings from the left wing to be replaced with the new set that my neighborhood machinist was cutting out for me. When I put the wing on the work bench to start removing the rear fittings, I thought I had better take a closer look at the bubbles in the leading edge. I found that as I pushed on the leading edge, it delaminated between the glass lay-up on top and the upper and lower wing skin edges that were floxed together underneath. I concluded that that area had to come apart and took a belt sander to the leading edge. What I found was that the leading edge had been floxed together and glassed over, but the mold release had never been scrubbed off the leading edge of the wing. It peeled apart for rebuild quite easily.
When I got back to removing the rear spar attach fittings, I noticed that the woodwork inside the wing looked awfully dull. The reason was that the wing had been closed up without varnishing any of the woodwork. This was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer.
I also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. The tapered pipe threads were tapered the wrong way to install the draincock into the tank. Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem.
When I finally got around to attaching the wing to the fuselage, I found that the front spar attach fittings were badly misaligned. Although they could be forced into alignment, I didn't think I needed that kind of preload on the main spar fittings. This problem was fixed by calling on my local neighborhood machinist to build me an aligning fixture and reaming the attach holes to the next larger size and ordering the new sized bolts.
On the fuselage I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. I must complement the manufacturers for taking care of that problem. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels and brakes even though the receipt for this set was over four years old and in the original builders name. Their only concern was that this set had never been placed in service yet.
I chose to sand the load of micro off the left wing to see what it was covering. When I got down to the glass, I found that there was no glass for the aft inch and a half of the underside of the wing in front of the aileron hinge. With the Diehl wing skins, you build the wings, then cut the ailerons out of trailing edge of the wing. He had mismeasured and cut too much material off the bottom side of the trailing edge in front of the aileron. It was filled by floxing a piece of spruce into the gap to fill the space between the back edge of the fiberglass and the aileron mount. I chose to wrap the trailing edge of that wing, and the other wing to match with a couple of lay-ups of glass.
When I sanded the primer off the aforementioned damaged trim tab, I found that the hinge was floxed to the leading edge of the foam insides of the tab, but not the glass. I also chose to wrap the front of the trim tab with a lay-up of glass.
I decided to pull the paper off the canopy and take a look at it before I'm ready to bolt it on and fly. The original builder had blown his own canopy and after some of the previous problems, I was beginning to have some concerns about not having looked it over closely enough. The canopy turned out to have been blow a little too large. It ended up with a little larger bubble for headroom, which I didn't object to. However, it had more headroom on the right side than the left. Yes, it was just a little bit lopsided. The main problem was that the canopy is stretched thin enough that it can be easily pushed in with one hand when the weather is warm.. My fear was that this is just thin enough that it may decide to lay on my head or in my lap when flying on a warm day. It will have to be replaced.
I'm sure that many that are reading this could see several of the potential problems before I mentioned them, but some others may not have and I'm sure that there could have been many other problems that didn't but could have existed on this project. This is also not intended to be critical of the gentleman that started this project as many parts of it, especially the wood work are better than I could have done and much of his work is outstanding. I prefer to think that I'll end up with a better plane with his woodwork combined with my glasswork. This article is intended to feature some of the problems that you may run into in buying someone else's project.
The final question is, knowing what I have found over the past year, would I have still purchased this project. The answer is yes, but primarily because the price was right in that I am still money and work ahead of where I would be if I had started the project from scratch. There are a few things that I would have done differently, but nothing that I can't live with. Although I won't be able to say that I built it all from scratch, I have built and rebuild enough of the plane that I should have no problem qualifying under the 51% rule.

Here is an brief explanation of how I built my turtledecks. The jig was constructed from scrap plywood and a few 1x4s that I ripped into stringers. I made two temporary bulkheads from the plywood, one for each end. Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo.
After the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade.
After the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads. When the flox cured the bondo joints were broken, again being careful not to harm the wood. The turtledeck was removed from the fuselage and 2 inch tapes added to the bulkheads inside and out.
At this point the turtledeck looked great and only weighed about 5lbs. but I noticed you could deform the skin by pushing hard on the outside. So I flipped the turtledeck over and from 1/4 inch last-a-foam, I cut two inch wide strips that would run the entire length, forward and aft inside the turtledeck. In effect these would act as composite stringers, I made enough of these two inch wide strips to make up three stringers. One down the center (sort of a backbone) and one on each side of the ""backbone"" half the distance to the edge of the turtledeck. I sanded the edge of the foam so that when covered with a layer of bid @ 45degrees there would be a nice transition from the turtledeck skin up onto the foam and then back onto the turtledeck I scuff sanded and glued the foam stringers in with micro. I covered the foam stringers with one layer of 8oz bid @ 45degrees.","['The longerons bow up from the building surface, forming a ""banana"" shape.']",6240,multifieldqa_en,en,,9ac60cf60d4bae1dc93b09f374b74b3dec8b1b333397d7cd," This is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 &KR-2 series planes. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built. The problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are ""foreshortened"" and don't give the proper shape. What needs to be done is to ""develop"" the ""true"" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in plane strain. The main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. This is mainly to obtain the ability to ""fair"" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape. The next article in the series will discuss jigging and building techniques to ensure alignment and strai. The layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time.

Full (true size) scale plots may be made available depending on demand. To date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5KR2Ss now in the air. KR2 builders tend to be innovative, which leads to interesting mods that the KR2 has. The KR2 is a case in point: Many who'd heard of the pitch and tightness of the cabin of theKR2 began to modify the plans to suit their needs. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport. Ken was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident.  KR Forum featured guest speakers Mike Stearns, Steve Trentman, and Bill Marcey. Les Palmer's KR2 N202LP won Best KR2, Best Engine Installation, and People's Choice awards at the 1995 KR Gathering at Columbia, TN. The KR2 is stretched 2"" between firewall and main spar, and 14"" behind the main spar. The fuselage is made from Douglas fir, which weighs in at 4 lbs heavier than if constructed from spruce. Les's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy Hegy. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6"" Cleveland calipers for braking. The cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. The KR-2S was designed by Rand Robinson in the 1980s. The plane was designed to fly at speeds of up to 180 mph. It was designed with low ground clearance and a large fuselage. It has been partially built by a team of four people. The project has been in the works for more than 20 years and is still in the planning stages. It is not yet clear if the plane will ever be fully built by Robinsons' team.

CNN.com's John Sutter sat down with a group of friends to try to find a way to get to the top of the list. Sutter started out by looking at the glass work on the turtle back. He found that the aileron bellcranks were not built or installed as per plans, but found that they looked professional. He decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the new set of wings and still be way ahead of the rest of the group. Now for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with that I didn't know any of the people at the center of the story about. The top 10 list: ""Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough. Some by ignorance and some by not looking very close enough."" The bottom 10 list includes: ""I found a small linear crack in the lower left wing cap on the left wing stub,"" and ""I didn't find anything else that might be questionable about the right-side of the wall"" Le towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in. Or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap. Also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem. I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels andbrakes even though the set for this set was four years old and in the original builders name. Their only receipt was over receipt was a receipt for the set that was over four yearsold and in their co-owner's name. The problem was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer. This article is intended to feature some of the problems that you may run into in buying someone else's project. The canopy turned out to have been blow a little too large.

When did Goodwin become a Naval aviator?,"Hugh Hilton Goodwin (December 21, 1900 – February 25, 1980) was a decorated officer in the United States Navy with the rank of Vice Admiral. A veteran of both World Wars, he commanded escort carrier  during the Mariana Islands campaign. Goodwin then served consecutively as Chief of Staff, Carrier Strike Group 6 and as Air Officer, Philippine Sea Frontier and participated in the Philippines campaign in the later part of the War.

Following the War, he remained in the Navy and rose to the flag rank and held several important commands including Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service, Commander, Carrier Division Two and Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command.

Early life and career

Hugh H. Goodwin was born on December 21, 1900, in Monroe, Louisiana and attended Monroe High School there (now Neville High School). Following the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, Goodwin left the school without receiving the diploma in order to see some combat and enlisted the United States Navy on May 7, 1917. He completed basic training and was assigned to the battleship . Goodwin participated in the training of armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war and in November 1917, he sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea.

Although he did not complete the last year of high school, Goodwin was able to earn an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918. While at the academy, he earned a nickname ""Huge"" and among his classmates were several future admirals and generals including: Hyman G. Rickover, Milton E. Miles, Robert E. Blick Jr., Herbert S. Duckworth, Clayton C. Jerome, James P. Riseley, James A. Stuart, Frank Peak Akers, Sherman Clark, Raymond P. Coffman, Delbert S. Cornwell, Frederick J. Eckhoff, Ralph B. DeWitt, John Higgins, Vernon Huber, Albert K. Morehouse, Harold F. Pullen, Michael J. Malanaphy, William S. Parsons, Harold R. Stevens, John P. Whitney, Lyman G. Miller and George J. O'Shea.

Goodwin graduated with Bachelor of Science degree on June 3, 1922, and was commissioned Ensign in the United States Navy. He was subsequently assigned to the battleship  and took part in the voyage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before he was ordered to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island for submarine instruction in June 1923. Goodwin completed the training several weeks later and was attached to the submarine . He then continued his further training aboard submarine  and following his promotion to Lieutenant (junior grade) on June 3, 1925, he qualified as submariner.

He then served aboard submarine  off the coast of California, before he was ordered for the recruiting duty to San Francisco in September 1927. While in this capacity, Goodwin applied for naval aviation training which was ultimately approved and he was ordered to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in August 1928. Toward the end of the training, he was promoted to lieutenant on December 11, 1928, and upon the completion of the training in January 1929, he was designated Naval aviator.

Goodwin was subsequently attached to the Observation Squadron aboard the aircraft carrier  and participated in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean. He was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. in August 1931 and served consecutively under the architect of naval aviation William A. Moffett and future Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King.

In June 1933, Goodwin was ordered to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, where he completed junior course in May of the following year. He subsequently joined the crew of aircraft carrier  and served under Captain Arthur B. Cook and took part in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States.

He was ordered back to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in June 1936 and was attached to the staff of the Base Commandant, then-Captain Charles A. Blakely. When Blakely was succeeded by William F. Halsey in June 1937, Goodwin remained in Halsey's staff and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on December 1, 1937. He also completed correspondence course in International law at the Naval War College.

Goodwin was appointed Commanding officer of the Observation Squadron 1 in June 1938 and attached to the battleship  he took part in the patrolling of the Pacific and 
West Coast of the United States until September 1938, when he assumed command of the Observation Squadron 2 attached to the battleship .

When his old superior from Lexington, now Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, was appointed Commander Aircraft, Scouting Force in June 1939, he requested Goodwin as his Aide and Flag Secretary. He became Admiral Cook's protégé and after year and half of service in the Pacific, he continued as his Aide and Flag Secretary, when Cook was appointed Commander Aircraft, Atlantic Fleet in November 1940.

World War II

Following the United States' entry into World War II, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Commander on January 1, 1942, and assumed duty as advisor to the Argentine Navy. His promotion was made permanent two months later and he returned to the United States in early 1943 for duty as assistant director of Planning in the Bureau of Aeronautics under Rear admiral John S. McCain. While still in Argentina, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Captain on June 21, 1942.

By the end of December 1943, Goodwin was ordered to Astoria, Oregon, where he assumed command of newly commissioned escort carrier USS Gambier Bay. He was responsible for the initial training of the crew and was known as a strict disciplinarian, but the crew appreciated the skills he taught them that prepared them for combat. Goodwin insisted that everyone aboard has to do every job right every time and made us fight our ship at her best.

During the first half of 1944, Gambier Bay was tasked with ferrying aircraft for repairs and qualified carrier pilots from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before departed on May 1, 1944, to join Rear admiral Harold B. Sallada's Carrier Support Group 2, staging in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas.

The air unit, VC-10 Squadron, under Goodwin's command gave close air support to the initial landings of Marines on Saipan on June 15, 1944, destroying enemy gun emplacements, troops, tanks, and trucks. On the 17th, her combat air patrol (CAP) shot down or turned back all but a handful of 47 enemy planes headed for her task group and her gunners shot down two of the three planes that did break through to attack her.

Goodwin's carrier continued in providing of close ground support operations at Tinian during the end of July 1944, then turned her attention to Guam, where she gave identical aid to invading troops until mid-August that year. For his service during the Mariana Islands campaign, Goodwin was decorated with Bronze Star Medal with Combat ""V"".

He was succeeded by Captain Walter V. R. Vieweg on August 18, 1944, and appointed Chief of Staff, Carrier Division Six under Rear admiral Arthur W. Radford. The Gambier Bay was sunk in the Battle off Samar on October 25, 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf after helping turn back a much larger attacking Japanese surface force.

Goodwin served with Carrier Division Six during the Bonin Islands raids, the naval operations at Palau and took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and operations supporting Leyte landings in late 1944. He was later appointed Air Officer of the Philippine Sea Frontier under Rear admiral James L. Kauffman and remained with that command until the end of hostilities. For his service in the later part of World War II, Goodwin was decorated with Legion of Merit with Combat ""V"". He was also entitled to wear two Navy Presidential Unit Citations and Navy Unit Commendation.

Postwar service

Following the surrender of Japan, Goodwin assumed command of Light aircraft carrier  on August 24, 1945. The ship was tasked with air missions over Japan became mercy flights over Allied prisoner-of-war camps, dropping food and medicine until the men could be rescued. She was also present at Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945.

Goodwin returned with San Jacinto to the United States in mid-September 1945 and he was detached in January 1946. He subsequently served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations until May that year, when he entered the instruction at National War College. Goodwin graduated in June 1947 and served on Secretary's committee for Research on Reorganization. Upon promotion to Rear admiral on April 1, 1949, Goodwin was appointed Chief of Staff and Aide to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet under Admiral William H. P. Blandy.

Revolt of the Admirals

In April 1949, the budget's cuts and proposed reorganization of the United States Armed Forces by the Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson launched the wave of discontent between senior commanders in the United States Navy. Johnson proposed the merging of the Marine Corps into the Army, and reduce the Navy to a convoy-escort force.

Goodwin's superior officer, Admiral Blandy was call to testify before the House Committee on Armed Services and his harsh statements for the defense of the Navy, costed him his career. Goodwin shared his views and openly criticized Secretary Johnson for having power concentrated in a single civilian executive, who is an appointee of the Government and not an elected representative of the people. He also criticized aspects of defense unification which permitted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to vote on arms policies of individual services, and thus ""rob"" the branches of autonomy.

The outbreak of the Korean War in summer 1950 proved the proposal of Secretary Johnson as incorrect and he resigned in September that year. Also Secretary of the Navy, Francis P. Matthews resigned one month earlier.

Later service

Due to the Revolts of the admirals, Blandy was forced to retire in February 1950 and Goodwin was ordered to Newport, Rhode Island for temporary duty as Chief of Staff and Aide to the President of the Naval War College under Vice admiral Donald B. Beary in April 1950. Goodwin was detached from that assignment two months and appointed member of the General Board of the Navy. He was shortly thereafter appointed acting Navy Chief of Public Information, as the substitute for Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey, who was relieved of illness, but returned to the General Board of the Navy in July that year. Goodwin served in that capacity until February 1951, when he relieved his Academy class, Rear admiral John P. Whitney as Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service (MATS).

While in this capacity, Goodwin served under Lieutenant general Laurence S. Kuter and was co-responsible for the logistical support of United Nations troops fighting in Korea. The MATS operated from the United States to Japan and Goodwin served in this capacity until August 1953, when he was appointed Commander Carrier Division Two. While in this assignment, he took part in the Operation Mariner, Joint Anglo-American exercise which encountered very heavy seas over a two-week period in fall 1953.

Goodwin was ordered to the Philippines in May 1954 and assumed duty as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines with headquarters at Naval Station Sangley Point near Cavite. He held that command in the period of tensions between Taiwan and China and publicly declared shortly after his arrival, that any attack on Taiwan by the Chinese Communists on the mainland would result in US participation in the conflict. The naval fighter planes under his command also provided escort for passing commercial planes. Goodwin worked together with retired Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, then-Ambassador to the Philippines, and accompanied him during the visits to Singapore, Bangkok and Saigon in January 1955.

On December 18, 1955, Goodwin's classmate Rear admiral Albert K. Morehouse, then serving as Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), died of heart attack and Goodwin was ordered to CONAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado to assume Morehouse's position. While in this capacity, he was subordinated to Army General Earle E. Partridge and was responsible for the Naval and Marine Forces allocated to the command designated for the defense of the Continental United States.

Retirement

Goodwin retired on June 1, 1957, after 40 years of active service and was advanced to the rank of Vice admiral on the retired list for having been specially commended in combat. A week later, he was invited back to his Monroe High School (now Neville High School) and handed a diploma showing that he had been graduated with the class of 1918. He then settled in Monterey, California where he taught American history at Stevenson school and was a member of the Naval Order of the United States.

Vice admiral Hugh H. Goodwin died at his home on February 25, 1980, aged 79. He was survived by his wife, Eleanor with whom he had two children, a daughter Sidney and a son Hugh Jr., who graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1948, but died one year later, when the Hellcat fighter he was piloting collided with another over the Gulf of Mexico during training.

When did Born resign as chairperson of the CFTC?,"Brooksley Elizabeth Born (born August 27, 1940) is an American attorney and former public official who, from August 26, 1996, to June 1, 1999, was chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the federal agency which oversees the U.S. futures and commodity options markets. During her tenure on the CFTC, Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of off-exchange markets for derivatives, in addition to its role with respect to exchange-traded derivatives, but her warnings were ignored or dismissed, and her calls for reform resisted by other regulators.<ref name=""nytimes"">Goodman, Peter S. The Reckoning - Taking Hard New Look at a Greenspan Legacy, The New York Times, October 9, 2008.</ref> Born resigned as chairperson on June 1, 1999, shortly after Congress passed legislation prohibiting her agency from regulating derivatives.

In 2009, Born received the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award, along with Sheila Bair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in recognition of the ""political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed"" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Early life and education
Born graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco, California) at the age of 16. She then attended Stanford University, where she majored in English and was graduated with the class of 1961.  She initially wanted to become a doctor, but a guidance counsellor at Stanford advised her against medicine, so she majored in English literature instead.

She then attended Stanford Law School, one of only seven women in her class.  She was the first female student ever to be named president of the Stanford Law Review. She received the ""Outstanding Senior"" award and graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1964.

Legal career
Immediately after law school Born was selected as a law clerk to judge Henry Edgerton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It was during this time that she met her first husband, Jacob C. Landau, who was a journalist covering the Federal courts at the time. Following her clerkship, she became an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based international law firm of Arnold & Porter. Born was attracted to Arnold & Porter because it was one of the few major law firms to have a woman partner at that time, Carolyn Agger, who was the head of the tax practice. Born took a two-year leave of absence from Arnold & Porter to accompany her first husband to Boston, where he had received a fellowship. During that time she worked as a research assistant to law professor Alan Dershowitz.

Born's early career at Arnold & Porter focused on international trade law, in which she represented a number of Swiss industries and the government of Switzerland. She developed a practice representing clients in numerous complex litigation and arbitration cases involving financial market transactions. Among her high-profile cases was the matter of the Hunt Brothers attempt to corner the market in silver in the 1970s. She made partner at Arnold & Porter, after moving to a three-day schedule to help raise her second child, and eventually rose to be the head of the firm's derivatives practice.

Born was among the first female attorneys to systematically address inequities regarding how the laws treated women. Born and another female lawyer, Marna Tucker, taught what is considered to have been the first ""Women and the Law"" course at Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law. The class exclusively concerned prejudicial treatment of women under the laws of the United States, past and present.  Born and Tucker were surprised to discover that there was no textbook on the issue at the time.  Born is also one of the co-founders of the National Women's Law Center. Born also helped rewrite the American Bar Association rules to make it possible for more women and minorities to sit on federal bench.

During her long legal career, and into her retirement, Born did much pro bono and other types of volunteer work. She was active in the American Bar Association, the largest professional organization of lawyers in the United States.  Initially Born was named a member of the governing council of the ABA's Individual Rights Section, eventually becoming chairperson.  Born and Tucker founded the ABA Women's Caucus, the first organization of female lawyers in the ABA.  She held several other senior positions in the ABA, including being named the first woman member of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Born provided testimony and opinion on persons nominated for federal judgeships. In 1980 she was named chair of the committee.  As chair of the committee, Born was invited to address the U.S. Congress regarding the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In 1993, Born's name was floated as a possible candidate for Attorney General of the United States, but Janet Reno was nominated.

In July 2009, Nancy Pelosi appointed Brooksley Born as a commissioner to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC).

Born and the OTC derivatives market
Born was appointed to the CFTC on April 15, 1994, by President Bill Clinton. Due to litigation against Bankers Trust Company by Procter and Gamble and other corporate clients, Born and her team at the CFTC sought comments on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, a first step in the process of writing CFTC regulations to supplement the existing regulations of the Federal Reserve System,  the Options Clearing Corporation, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Born was particularly concerned about swaps, financial instruments that are traded over the counter between banks, insurance companies or other funds or companies, and thus have no transparency except to the two counterparties and the counterparties' regulators, if any.  CFTC regulation was strenuously opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. On May 7, 1998, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt joined Rubin and Greenspan in objecting to the issuance of the CFTC's concept release. Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a ""legal uncertainty"" regarding such financial instruments,  hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would ""stifle financial innovation"" and encourage financial capital to transfer its  transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies,  insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies.

In 1998, a trillion-dollar hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was near collapse.  Using mathematical models to calculate debt risk, LTCM used derivatives to leverage $5 billion into more than $1 trillion, doing business with fifteen of Wall Street's largest financial institutions.  The derivative transactions were not regulated, nor were investors able to evaluate LTCM's exposures.  Born stated, ""I thought that LTCM was exactly what I had been worried about"".  In the last weekend of September 1998, the President's working group was told that the entire American economy hung in the balance.  After intervention by the Federal Reserve, the crisis was averted.  In congressional hearings into the crisis, Greenspan acknowledged that language had been introduced into an agriculture bill that would prevent CFTC from regulating the derivatives which were at the center of the crisis that threatened the US economy.  U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) asked ""How many more failures do you think we'd have to have before some regulation in this area might be appropriate?""  In response, Greenspan brushed aside the substance of Born's warnings with the simple assertion that ""the degree of supervision of regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system"". Born's warning was that there wasn't any regulation of them.  Born's chief of staff, Michael Greenberger summed up Greenspan's position this way: ""Greenspan didn't believe that fraud was something that needed to be enforced, and he assumed she probably did. And of course, she did.""  Under heavy pressure from the financial lobby, legislation prohibiting regulation of derivatives by Born's agency was passed by the Congress.  Born resigned on June 1, 1999.

The derivatives market continued to grow yearly throughout both terms of George W. Bush's administration. On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers forced a broad recognition of a financial crisis in both the US and world capital markets.  As Lehman Brothers' failure temporarily reduced financial capital's confidence, a number of newspaper articles and television programs suggested that the failure's possible causes included the conflict between the CFTC and the other regulators.Faiola, Anthony, Nakashima, Ellen and Drew, Jill. The Crash: Risk and Regulation - What Went Wrong, The Washington Post, October 15, 2008.

Born declined to publicly comment on the unfolding 2008 crisis until March 2009, when she said: ""The market grew so enormously, with so little oversight and regulation, that it made the financial crisis much deeper and more pervasive than it otherwise would have been."" She also lamented the influence of Wall Street lobbyists on the process and the refusal of regulators to discuss even modest reforms.

An October 2009 Frontline documentary titled ""The Warning""  described Born's thwarted efforts to regulate and bring transparency to the derivatives market, and the continuing opposition thereto. The program concluded with an excerpted interview with Born sounding another warning: ""I think we will have continuing danger from these markets and that we will have repeats of the financial crisis -- may differ in details but there will be significant financial downturns and disasters attributed to this regulatory gap, over and over, until we learn from experience.""

In 2009 Born, along with Sheila Bair of the FDIC, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in recognition of the ""political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed"" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.  According to Caroline Kennedy, ""Brooksley Born recognized that the financial security of all Americans was being put at risk by the greed, negligence and opposition of  powerful and well connected interests.... The catastrophic financial events of recent months have  proved them [Born and Sheila Bair] right.""  One member of the President's working group had a change of heart about Brooksley Born.  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt stated ""I've come to know her as one of the most capable, dedicated, intelligent and committed public servants that I have ever come to know"", adding that ""I could have done much better. I could have made a difference"" in response to her warnings.

In 2010, a documentary film Inside Job further alleged that derivatives regulation was ineffective from the Clinton administration on. Along with fellow whistleblower, former IMF Chief Economist Raghuram Rajan, who was also scorned by the economic establishment, Brooksley Born was cited as one of the authorities arguing that financial derivatives increase economic risk.

 Personal life 
Born is married to Alexander E. Bennett (also retired from Arnold & Porter).  She has five adult children - two from a previous marriage to Jacob Landau and three stepchildren. Notably, Born was named a partner at Arnold & Porter while working part-time so she could raise her two young children.  When both of her children were school-age, Born returned to practice full-time.

In the last weekend of September 1998, the President's working group was told that the entire American economy hung in the balance. After intervention by the Federal Reserve, the crisis was averted. In July 2009, Nancy Pelosi appointed Brooksley Born as a commissioner to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC). Born and the OTC derivatives market were at the center of the crisis that threatened the U.S. economy. She was named the first woman member of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. In 1980 she was named chair of the committee. In 1993, Born's name was floated as a possible candidate for Attorney General of the United States. Brooksley Born was the head of the CFTC, which regulated the over-the-counter derivatives market. In 1999, she warned that there wasn't any regulation of them. The derivatives market continued to grow yearly throughout both terms of George W. Bush's administration. On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers forced a broad recognition of a financial crisis in both the US and world capital markets. Born declined to publicly comment on the unfolding 2008 crisis until March 2009, when she said: ""The market grew so enormously, with so little oversight and regulation, that it made the financial crisis much deeper and more pervasive than it otherwise would have been"" In 2009 Born, along with Sheila Bair of the FDIC, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in recognition of the ""political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed"" to the 2007-08 financial crisis. In 2010, a documentary film further alleged that derivatives regulation was ineffective from the Clinton administration on. Brooksley Born was named a partner at Arnold & Porter while working part-time so she could raise her two young children. When both of her children were school-age, Born returned to practice full-time. Born is the winner of the 2009 Profiles in Courage Award. He is married to the former head of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He has two daughters and a son. He lives in San Francisco with his wife."
Which orders did Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind receive Khilafat from?,"Ghousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was born on Monday, 22nd of Zil Hijjah 1310 AH (18 July 1892) in the most beautiful city of Bareilly Shareef, India. It was in this very city that his illustrious father, the Mujaddid (Reviver) of Islam, Imam-e-Ahle Sunnat, A'la Hazrat, Ash Shah Imam Ahmed Raza Khan Al Qaderi (radi Allahu anhu) was born (1856 - 1921).
At the time of the birth of Ghousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu), his distinguished father, was in Mahrerah Shareef, one of the great spiritual centers of the Sunni World. On that very night, Sayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu) dreamt that he had been blessed with a son and in his dream he named his son ""Aale Rahmaan"". Hazrat Makhdoom Shah Abul Hussain Ahmadi Noori (radi Allahu anhu), one of the great personalities of Mahrerah Shareef, named the child ""Abul Barkaat Muhiy'yuddeen Jilani"".
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was later named ""Mustapha Raza Khan"". His Aqiqa was done on the name of ""Muhammad"", which was the tradition of the family.
Upon the birth of Ghousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) Sayyiduna Shah Abul Hussain Ahmadi Noori (radi Allahu anhu) told A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu), ""Maulana! When I come to Bareilly Shareef, then I will definitely see this child. He is a very blessed child.""
As promised, when Sayyiduna Abul Hussain Ahmadi Noori (radi Allahu anhu) went to Bareilly Shareef, he immediately summoned to see Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) who was only six (6) months old. Sayyiduna Noori Mia (radi Allahu anhu), as he was also famously known, congratulated A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu) and said, ""This child will be of great assistance to the Deen and through him the servants of Almighty Allah will gain great benefit. This child is a Wali. From his blessed sight thousands of stray Muslims will become firm on the Deen. He is a sea of blessings.""
On saying this, Sayyiduna Noori Mia (radi Allahu anhu) placed his blessed finger into the mouth of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and made him a Mureed. He also blessed him with I'jaazat and Khilafat at the same time. (Mufti Azam Hind Number, pg. 341). Not only did he receive Khilafat in the Qaderi Silsila (Order), but also in the Chishti, Nakshbandi, Suharwardi, and Madaari Orders. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) also received Khilafat from his blessed father, A'la Hazrat, Ash Shah Imam Ahmed Raza Khan Al Qaderi (radi Allahu anhu).
Ghousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) attained most of his early education from his illustrious family - from his father, A'la Hazrat, Ash Shah Imam Ahmed Raza Khan Al Qaderi (radi Allahu anhu) the Mujaddid of Islam, whose status and position even at that time cannot be explained in these few lines. He also studied Kitaabs under the guidance of Hazrat Moulana Haamid Raza Khan (his elder brother), Maulana Shah Rahm Ilahi Maglori and Maulana Sayed Basheer Ahmad Aligarhi and Maulana Zahurul Hussain Rampuri (radi Allahu anhum). He studied various branches of knowledge under the guidance of his most learned and blessed father, A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu). He gained proficiency in the many branches of Islamic knowledge from among which are: Tafseer; Hadith; Fiqh; Laws of Jurisprudence; Sarf; Nahw; Tajweed; Conduct of Language; Philosophy; Logistics; Mathematics; History etc.; Arithmetic; Aqaid (Belief); Taasawwaf; Poetry; Debating; Sciences; etc.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu's) brilliance as an Islamic Scholar manifested itself when he was a still a youth, but overflowing with knowledge and wisdom. He wrote his first historical Fatawa (Islamic Ruling) when he was only 13 years old. It dealt with the topic of ""Raza'at"" - affinity between persons breast fed by the same woman. The following has been recorded with regards to this occasion.
Hazrat Maulana Zafrud'deen and Hazrat Maulana Sayed Abdur Rasheed (radi Allahu anhum) were at the Darul Ifta (Fatawa Department) at this stage. One day, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) walked into the Darul Ifta and noticed that Hazrat Maulana Zafrud'deen (radi Allahu anhu) was writing a certain Fatawa. He was taking ""Fatawa Razvia"" from the shelf as his reference. On seeing this, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said, ""Are you relying on Fatawa Razvia to write an answer?"" Maulana Zafrud'deen (radi Allahu anhu) replied, ""Alright then, why don't you write the answer without looking."" Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) then wrote a powerful answer without any problem. This was the Fatawa concerning ""Raza'at"" - the very first Fatawa which he had written.
Sayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu) then signed the Fatawa. He also commanded Hafiz Yaqeenudeen (radi Allahu anhu) to make a stamp for Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) as a gift and said that it should read as follows: ""Abul Barkaat Muhiy'yuddeen Jilani Aale Rahmaan urf Mustapha Raza Khan.""
This incident took place in 1328 AH. After this incident Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) spent another 12 years writing Fatawas at the feet of A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu). He was given this immense responsibility of issuing Fatawas even while A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu) was in this physical world. He continued this trend until his last breath. The stamp which was given to him was mislaid during his second Hajj when his bags were lost.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) married the blessed daughter of his paternal uncle, Hazrat Muhammad Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu). He had 6 daughters and one son, Hazrat Anwaar Raza (radi Allahu anhu), who passed away during childhood.
""Khuda Kheyr se Laaye Wo Din Bhi Noori, Madine ki Galiya Buhara Karoo me""
Tajedaare Ahle Sunnah, Taaje Wilayat Wa Karaamat, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) went twice for Hajj - in 1905 and 1945. He performed his third Hajj in 1971.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was the first person to go for Hajj without a photograph in his passport. He refused to take a photograph. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was allowed to go for Hajj without a photograph in his passport and without taking any vaccinations.
During his trip to Makkatul Mukarramah, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu), also had the opportunity of meeting those Ulema whom his father, Sayidduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu), met during his visit to Haramain Sharifain. These great Ulema were from amongst the students of Sayed Yahya Almaan (radi Allahu anhu). A few of the Ulema that he met were Allamah Sayed Ameen Qutbi; Allamah Sayed Abbas Alawi and Allamah Sayed Noor Muhammad (radi Allahu anhum) - to mention just a few. They narrated many incidents which had taken place during Sayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu's) visit to Haramain Sharifain. They then requested Khilafat from Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, (radi Allahu anhu) which he bestowed upon them.
Tajedaare Ahle Sunnah, Taaje Wilayat Wa Karaamat, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was aware of the actual time of his Wisaal.
On the 6th of Muharram (1981) he said, ""All those who intended to become my Mureed but for some reason or the other could not come to me, I have made all of them Mureed and I have given their hands into the hand of Sayidduna Ghousul Azam (radi Allahu anhu).""
On the 12th of Muharram (1981) Hazrat said, ""All those who asked me to make Dua for them, I have made Dua for their Jaiz (permissible) intentions to be fulfilled. May Allah accept this Dua."" On this day he asked those that were present concerning date. They told him that it was the 12th of Muharram. On hearing this he became silent.
On the 13th of Muharram, he again asked concerning the date and the Mureedeen present said that it was Wednesday, the 13th of Muharram. On hearing this Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said, ""Namaaz will be held at Nau Mahla Musjid"". Those present did not understand what he meant, but remained silent out of respect. After some time again Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said, ""Did anybody tell you about the Namaaz. I will read Jumma Namaaz in Nau Mahla Masjid."" After some time Hazrat said, ""Did anybody say anything about the Fatiha."" Those present just gazed at each others faces and remained silent. Only later did they realise what Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was implying. Hazrat was spiritally present for Jummah at the Nau Mahla Masjid! Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was not only giving hope to the Mureedeen but also informing them of his Wisaal.
The shining star of A'la Hazrat, Ash Shah Imam Ahmed Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu), the glitter and the hope for the hearts of millions throughout the world, the Mujaddid of the 15th Century, the Imam of his time, Huzoor Sayyidi Sarkaar Mufti-e- Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) left the Aalame Duniya to Journey towards the Aalame Aakhira. It was 1.40 p.m. on the eve of the 14th of Muharram 1402 AH (1981).
""Chal diye tum Aankho me ashko ka darya chor kar, har jigar me dard apna meetha meetha chor kar""
Rawa Aankho se he Ashko ke Dhaare Mufti-e-Azam, Kaha Ho Be Saharo Ka Sahara Mufti-e-Azam""
On Friday, the 15th of Muharram, at 8. 00 a.m. the Ghusl of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) took place. His nephew, Hazrat Maulana Rehan Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) performed the Wudhu. Hazrat Allamah Mufti Mohammed Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari performed the Ghusl. Sultan Ashraf Sahib used the jug to pour water. The following persons were present during the Ghusl : Hazrat Maulana Rehan Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu), Hazrat Allamah Mufti Mohammed Akhtar Raza Khan, Sayed Mustaaq Ali, Maulana Sayed Muhammad Husain, Sayed Chaif Sahib, Maulana Naeemullah Khan Sahib Qibla, Maulana Abdul Hamid Palmer Razvi, Muhammad Esa of Mauritius, Ali Husain Sahib, Hajji Abdul Ghaffar, Qari Amaanat Rasool Sahib and a few other Mureeds and family members.
Hazrat Allamah Mufti Mohammed Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari and Hazrat Maulana Rehan Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) have stated that at the time of the Ghusl Shareef of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) the Chaadar mistakenly moved a little. Immediately, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) held the Chaadar between his two fingers and covered the area that the Chaadar exposed. Those present thought that the Chaadar had just got caught between Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) fingers. They tried to remove the Chaadar from between his fingers but it would not move. The first person to notice this Karaamat was Hazrat Allamah Mohammed Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari. He showed this to everyone. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) fingers did not move until the area was properly covered.
""Zinda hojate he jo marte he haq ke Naam par, Allah, Allah Maut ko kis ne Masiha Kardiya""
""Janaaze se utha kar haath Pakri Chaadare Aqdas, He too Zinda He ye Zinda Karaamat Mufti e Azam""
As he had wished, the Janaza Salaah of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was performed by Maulana Sayed Mukhtar Ashraf Jilani at the Islamia Inter College grounds in Bareilly Shareef. Two and a half million (2 500 000) Muslims attended his Janazah Salaah. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) is buried on the left-hand-side of Sayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu). Those who lowered Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) in his Qabr Shareef have stated that they were continously wiping out perspiration from the forehead of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) right up to the last minute.
""Maangne Waala sub kuch paaye rota aaye hasta Jaaye"", ""Ye He Unki Adna Karamat Mufti Azam Zinda Baad""
Wealth, presidency, minister ship, worldly satisfaction and happiness can be given to a person by anyone, but such people do not have the spiritual insight to give tranquility to a disturbed heart and they cannot put a smile onto the face of a depressed person. But Tajedaare Ahle Sunnah, Taaje Wilayat Wa Karaamat, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) gave both the treasures of the physical world and the spiritual worlds to those in need. To be his servant was not less than kingship. Every day hundreds and thousands of people in need of spiritual, physical and academic needs would come to him and each one of them returned with complete satisfaction.
""Jhuki Hai Gardane Dar Par Tumhare, Taaj Waalo Ki, Mere Aqa Mere Maula Wo Taajul Auliyah Tum Ho""
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) is that light of such an illustrious family whose radiance reflected itself in his character and manners that he displayed - such qualities that very few would be able to reach perfection. His character was the true embodiment of the Sunnah of Sayyiduna Rasulullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). He shone like a star in the darkness of the night.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) possessed great heights of good character, moral standards, kindness, sincerity, love and humbleness. He never refused the invitation of any poor Muslim. He always stayed away from those who were very wealthy and lavish. He was the possessor of great moral and ethical values.
It is stated that once Akbar Ali Khan, a Governor of U.P., came to visit Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) did not meet him but left to a place called Puraana Shahar (Old City) to visit a poor Sunni Muslim who was very ill and at the doorstep of death.
In another occasion, Fakhruddeen Ali Ahmad, the President of a Political Party, came to visit Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) but was refused this opportunity. Many other proud ministers had also come to meet Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) but met with the same fate. This was due to his extreme dislike for politics and involvement in worldly affairs.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) never fell short in entertaining those who came to visit him. When he was physically fit he used go into the Visitors Section and ask each person whether they had eaten or not. He used to ask them if they partook in tea or not. He used to continuously enquire as to whether they were experiencing any difficulties or not. It was often seen that he would personally carry the dishes into the house for the visitors! He was definitely blessed with the characters of the ""Salfe Saliheen"" or The Pious Servants of Allah.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was a pillar of hospitality and humbleness. If he reprimanded a certain person for doing something un-Islamic or if he became displeased with anyone for some reason or the other, he used to also explain to the person in a very nice way and also try to cheer that person. He would then make Dua in abundance for such a person. His Mureeds (Disciples), on many ocassions, used to recite Manqabats (Poetry) in his praise. On hearing such Manqabats he would say, ""I am not worthy of such praise. May Allah make me worthy.""
Many people came to him for his blessings. Others would come for Ta'weez. He never refused anyone. It is also not known how many homes were being supported through the kindness and hospitality of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu). He always entertained those who came from far and near to the best of his means. He used to even give most of his visitors train and bus fares to travel. In winter, he would give warm clothes, warm sheets and blankets to the poor and the needy.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) gave Khilafat to many Ulema-e-Ikraam and personally tied the Amaama (Turban) on their heads. He gave cloaks, turbans and hats to many people. Once, during winter, a few of the Khaadims were present with Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). He was lying on his bed and covered with a shawl. A certain Maulana Abu Sufyaan touched Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) shawl and commented as to how beautiful it was. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) immediately removed the shawl and presented it to him. Although the Moulana refused to accept it Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) gave it to him forcefully.
All of his Mehfils were full of knowledge and Barkah. Many questions on Tassawuf were easily answered by him. It seemed as if the rains of mercy and rays of Noor were spread all over his Mehfils.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) always wanted to see a Muslim's inner and outer personality. He always advised them to mould their lives according to the principles and the commands of Islam. He always showed discomfort to those who did not have beards, those who wore hats and to those who wore ultra-western clothes. He used to warn such Muslims. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) used to show his displeasure towards those who wore ties. He used to tug at their ties and commanded them to abstain from wearing a tie. He also asked them to make Tauba from such acts.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) always commanded Muslims to give or take anything with their right hand. He stopped the Muslims from calling the governments as their ""Sarkaar"" or leaders. He never kept any ordinary Kitaab on the books of Tafseer or Hadith. Whenever he sat in a Meelad-un-Nabi (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) or Mehfil-e-Zikr, he always sat with utmost respect until the very end.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) never spat towards the Qibla. He never stretched his legs in the direction of the Qibla. Whenever he entered the cemetery, he never used his entire feet to walk on the ground. He always walked on his toes. At times, he would stand on his toes for about half an hour in the graveyard making Dua-e- Maghfirat!
He always stopped Muslims from doing any false fortune telling. If any death or loss took place in the house of a Muslim, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) would go to comfort the people of that house but he would never eat there. He always advised those in sorrow to make Sabr and remember Almighty Allah. He always respected Ulema-e-Ikraam. He respected the Sayeds in such a manner as a slave will respect his King. He prohibited Muslims from keeping un-Islamic names. He preferred such names as Abdullah, Abdur Rahmaan, Muhammad and Ahmad.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) always performed his Salaah in Jamaah whether he was on journey or not. The moment he put his foot out of his house to go towards the Masjid, he used to be surrounded by his Mureeds (disciples) and well-wishers who would follow him till the Masjid door which was just a few feet away from his house. While some would be kissing his blessed hands, others tried to talk with him. He would reply to all those who made Salaam to him. On entering the Masjid, he would immediately recite the dua prescribed.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) would then remove his Amaama and then sit down to perform Wudhu. He would wash all the parts thoroughly so that the Sunnahs were accomplished. He would perform his Salaah with great sincerity and used to be lost in the worship of his Creator. The person who looked at him from a distance would have instantly understood that Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) had left all the worldly desires and was intent upon pleasing his Creator.
Once, while Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was traveling from Nagpur, it was time for Maghrib Salaah. He immediately disembarked from the train. The people told Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) that the train was about to leave, but he was intent on performing his Salaah. His companions also disembarked with him. They had just performed their Wudhu and were making Niyyah for Salaah when the train left the station. All of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) and his companions luggages' were left on the train. A few un-Islamic people who were there said ""the Mias train had left him"". Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was still in Salaah.
When they all had completed their Salaah, they noticed that the station platform was empty. They became a little worried since all their luggage had gone with the train, but still Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) looked undisturbed. His companions were busy talking about the luggage when they noticed the station guard, followed by a group of travellers, running towards them. The guard came up to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and said, ""Huzoor! The train is stuck!"" Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said, ""The engine is damaged."" The train was brought back and Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and his companions sat in the train. After some repairs the train left with him and his companions seated in it!
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was drowned in the love for the Holy Prophet, Sayyiduna Rasulullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Everything he did was for the pleasure of Almighty Allah and Sayyiduna Rasulullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). All that he had gained was due to the intense love which he possessed for the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam).
His extreme and intense love for the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) can be understood by the fact that during the latter stages of his life, even though he was very ill, he would sit for hours with great respect in the Naath Mehfils and would shed tears in his love for Sayyiduna Rasulullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). He used to celebrate the Meelad-un-Nabi (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) each year with great splendour. The programme used to begin on the eve of the 12th of Rabi-ul-Awwal and used to continue till the next day just before lunch. The invitation was open to all Muslims and they all used to be fed.
Even after examining the Naath Shareefs written by Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) one would see that every word written dislayed his measureless love for the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam).
In the world of poetry, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was a Giant of his time. Most of his poems were in the form of Humd (Praise of Allah), Naath Shareef, Qasidas and Manqabats compiled in the Arabic, Urdu, Persian and Hindi languages. All these poems were compiled into a book which is famously known as ""Samaane Bakhshish"" which is still available toady. Samaane Bakhshsish is a treasure chest which flows with pearls of love for Sayyiduna Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). The compilation of Samaane Bakhshish is through the blessings of Sayyiduna Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam).
""Ye Dil Ye Jigr Hai Ye Aankhe Ye Sar Hai, Jaha Chaaho Rakho Qadam Ghause Azam""
""Once a very young descendant of Sayyiduna Sheikh Abdul Qaadir Jilani (radi Allahu anhu), Hazrat Peer Taahir Ala'uddeen (radi Allahu anhu), visited Bareilly Shareef. The respect and honour that Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) showed towards him was out of this world. Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) used to walk bare feet behind him with great respect.""
The great Ulema of the time have stated that Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was lost to such an extent in the love for Sayyiduna Ghousul Azam, Sheikh Abdul Qaadir Jilani (radi Allahu anhu) that even physically he began to resemble Sheikh Abdul Qaadir Jilani (radi Allahu anhu).
""Dekh Kar Shakle Mufti Azam, Ghause Azam ki Yaad Aayi he""
Ghousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) had great respect and love for the Ulema and for Sayeds (Descendants of Sayyiduna Rasulullah sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). The respect which he showed towards them is beyond explanation.
One day, in 1979, a lady came with her little child to ask for Ta'weez. It was a very hot day and she was informed that Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was resting. The lady, however, was in great need for the particular Ta'weez. She asked someone to see if Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was awake but nobody had the nerve of going near him while he was resting as they considered this to be disrespectful. Taking her child she commented, ""What did we know that the words of Sayeds will not be heard in this place"".
It is not known how Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) heard this, but he immediately summoned one of the Mureeds. He instructed him to call the lady and not give her grief. The woman then sent her child to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). He asked the child's name and showed great love and respect towards this young child. With great affection, he placed his hand on the child's head. He even asked someone to bring an apple for the child. From behind the curtain, he spoke to the lady concerning her problem and immediately wrote a Ta'weez for her.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) then sent a message to his family requesting that the mother and child should only be allowed to leave after the heat became less intense; that they should be well entertained and that no shortage should be spared in entertaining these Sayeds.
When Allamah Sadru Shariah Maulana Amjad Ali Al Qadri (radi Allahu anhu), the author of the famous ""Bahare Shariah,"" used to come to Bareilly Shareef for the Urs Shareef of Sayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu), Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) used to go to the railway station to welcome him and showed great respect towards this Scholar of Islam. He also showed great respect towards Sayyidi Hafiz-e-Millat and Hazrat Maulana Hasmat Ali Khan Sahib (radi Allahu anhum). He also showed respect towards his own Mureeds and Khalifas who were Alims.
""Hawa he Gotand wa Tez lekin Chiraagh Apna Jala Raha he, Wo Marde Durwesh jis ko Haq ne diye the Andaze Khusrawana""
The sign of a true Mo'min is that he never submits himself before an enemy. In the worst of circumstances a Mo'min announces that which is the truth. Sayyiduna Rasulullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) said, ""To speak the truth before a tyrant King is a great Jihad."" So imagine the excellence of a person who always spoke the truth at all times, a person who always raised the flag of truth and honesty, and a person who never left the path of truth in his entire life!
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was one such person. He is one of the greatest leaders of the Sunnis. His boldness and fearlessness is difficult to explain. His entire life was spent speaking against Deobandis, Wahabis and all the other misleading sects, whether is was against the West, Qadianism, or Najdism he always challenged them right till the very end. He always propagated the true Deen and the Path of the Ahle Sunnah Wa Jamaah. With his Fatawas, he helped protect the Imaan of not only the Muslims in India and Pakistan, but of Muslims throughout the world.
He attacked the enemies of Islam through his writings, sayings, actions, etc. He did everything in his capacity to challenge the enemies of Islam. No person in his presence could say or do anything against Shariah. No person could speak against that which was the truth. It is stated by one of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) Khaadim's, who accompanied him on a journey by train, that there were some people in the train who were consuming alcohol. When Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) saw them, he reprimanded them and told them to desist from such a Haraam act. They did not listen to his advise so he scolded the leader of the group who was a young and well-built person. He gave the young person a hard slap which caused the bottle of alcohol to fall far from his hand. The Khaadim expected the person to retaliate but, who had the nerve to retaliate against this Lion of Islam! They became afraid and sat down quietly. Later some of them came up to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and begged for forgiveness for their shameful behavior.
""Tassawuf, Philsafa, Tafseer ki fiqhi Masa'il, Subhi kahte hai ke Aqida Kusha he Mufti Azam""
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu), who after writing his first Fatawa while still a student at ""Darul Uloom Manzare Islam"", was given the status of Mufti due to his immense knowledge. When the Muslim World began to see his knowledge and Fatawas brightenening the world, they began calling him ""Mufti-e-Azam"" or The Most Exalted Mufti of the Time. This title alone became the name he was recognised by. Whenever the name ""Mufti Azam Hind"" was mentioned, it referred to none other than his exalted personality.
Remember that he or she only is exalted who has been blessed with this excellence by Almighty Allah and His Beloved Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was a personality free from pride, lavishness and self- fame. His status was bestowed upon him by Almighty Allah and His Beloved Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). That person to whom Almighty Allah and His Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) grants such excellence, then such excellence cannot be understood by ordinary mortals. This is one of the reasons why the entire world was brightened and received the benefits of his knowledge of Fiqh.
There came a stage when Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was not only known as ""Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind"" but he was also known as ""Mufti-e-Azam-e-Alam"" or The Grand Mufti of the World.
It is recorded that on his trip to the Haramain Sharifain the Ulema of the Hejaz (Arabia), Syria, Egypt, Iraq, and from many other countries came to him to solve Fiqh Mas'alas. Many became his Mureeds. This is how his Faiz of Shariah and Tariqah spread its rays throughout the world. While in the Hejaz Shareef, he also had to deal with many Fatawas that poured in from various countries, such as, Africa, Mauritius, United Kingdom, America, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Malaysia, Bangladesh, and many other places. He answered every single one of them in a very dedicated and professional manner.
During the reign of General Ayub Khan a ""Rooyat Hilal Committee"" was formed in Pakistan for the purpose of sighting the moon for every Islamic Month, and more importantly, for Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha. An aeroplane was flown up to a certain height and the moon would be sighted from there. This form of Shahaadah (Confirmation) of the sighting of the moon via an aeroplane was readily accepted by the Pakistani Government. In this manner, Eid was celebrated.
On a specific occasion, on the 29th of Ramadaan, an aero plane was flown from the East to the West of Pakistan and the moon was reported to be sighted. This sighting was announced by the Hilaal Committee, but the Sunni Ulema of Pakistan did not accept this confirmation. The Ulema of Pakistan sent questionnaires to the Ulema throughout the world for clarification and one such questionnaire was sent to Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). Many Ulema replied that the confirmation had to be accepted and that it was permissible, but Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) clearly replied that this was not permissible. His Fatawa read as follows:"" The Command of Shariah is to sight the Moon and fast or celebrate Eid. Where the Moon is not sighted the Qazi should give an Islamic decision in connection with a confirmation. The moon must be sighted from the ground level or any place attached to the ground. With regards to the matter of using the plane - to sight the moon via a plane is wrong because the moon sets and does not perish. This is why it is sometimes sighted on the 29th and sometimes on the 30th. If to fly in a plane to sight the moon is a condition, then by increasing altitude the moon will be sighted even on the 27th and 28th. In this case, will the sighting be confirmed for the 27th or 28th? No person in his right sense will accept this. Thus under these circumstances, how would it be proper to sight the moon on the 29th?""
This Fatawa of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) appeared in every newspaper in Pakistan as ""Headline News"".
The following month, on the 27th and the 28th, the Pakistan Government sent an aeroplane at a higher altitude and found that the moon was visible on these days. The Government of Pakistan then accepted the Fatawa of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and the Hilaal Committee of Pakistan was disbanded.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) wrote more or less 50 000 Fatawas in his lifetime. His word was accepted by great Ulema. Shamsul Ulema, Hazrat Maulana Shamsud'deen Ja'fari (radi Allahu anhu) stated: ""In this era, there is no greater expert in Fiqha than Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). Whenever I present myself in his high court I always sit with my head bowed and I listen to his words in silence. I do not have the audacity to talk in abundance to him.""
""Amaanat Hind-o-Paak he is baat ke Shaahid, Ke badal deti he minto me Huqumat Mufti-e-Azam""
The year 1976 was a very difficult period for the Muslims in India. Certain Ulema, bought of by the Saudi Riyals and American Dollars, passed the Fatawa making Vasectomy (male sterilization to prevent birth of children) permissible. The Indian Government made Vasectomy necessary for every male in India at that time.
Muslims of India were in search of a Saviour to prevent such a law from being passed as this would mean them not having any more children. They were looking for someone who would stand and fight for their religious rights. All the Muslims looked towards the city of Bareilly Shareef, the city of light and truth, for an answer to this controversy. All of a sudden that Mujahhid of Islam rose with the torch of knowledge and light against the winds of enmity and destruction - Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). He immediately issued the true Fatawa on vasectomy and said, ""Vasectomy is Haraam, Haraam, Haraam."" This news spread throughout India. Through the Dua and firmness of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) on this issue, the Government that wished to pass this law had lost power, and a new government came into power. The law on Vasectomy was abolished!
Once, Maulana Abdul Hadi Al Qaderi and Soofi Iqbal Sahib asked Ghousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) the following question: ""Huzoor! Can one remember his Sheikh in Namaaz?"" Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) answered by saying, ""If you need to remember anyone in Namaaz then you should remember Tajedare Do Aalam, Habbibe Khuda (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Yes, just as people tend to gaze here and there in Namaaz - if, in this way, the thought of one's Peer comes into the mind, then there is no hindrance"". Subhan-Allah! Such caution is in this answer! This answer has also contradicted the Deobandi belief. By looking at the life of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and reading his Fatawas, one would see his status and excellence in the spiritual domain. His spiritual life was according to that of his renowned and distinguished father, Sayyiduna A'la Hazrat (radi Allahu anhu).
When the Americans were announcing there journey to the moon, a few Ulema were present with Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu). Amongst these Ulema were Shamsul Ulema Hazrat Maulana Shamsud'deen and Allamah Ghulam Jilani Mirati (radi Allahu anhum). They were discussing the concepts concerning the sun and the moon. Mufti-e-Azam-e- Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said that the sky and the earth are both stationary and that the moon and the sun are in motion. On hearing this Allama Ghulam Jilani Mirati (radi Allahu anhu) said, ""In the Holy Quran it is said, 'Wash Shamsu Tajri Li Mustaqaril'laha'. In other words, the sun is in motion in its fixed abode. From the word 'Tajri', it is obvious that the sun is in motion and from the word 'Mustaqaril'laha' it is obvious that it is stationary in one place. How can both these concepts be right?""
In answer to this, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind, Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) immediately said, ""It was commanded to Hazrat Adam (alaihis salaam) and Hazrat Hawa (radi Allahu anha) (as follows): 'Walakum fil Ardi Mustaqar'. Does this mean that they were stationary in only one portion of the earth? Did they not walk around (on the earth)? To be Mustaqar means to be stationary in your surrounding, not to come out of your boundaries. To move but to move within your boundaries of movement."" On hearing this Allama Mirati Sahib (radi Allahu anhu) became silent.
Hazrat Muhaddith-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) said: ""IN THIS TIME, THAT PERSONALITY WHOSE TAQWA (PIETY) IS MORE THAN HIS FATAWA, IS NONE OTHER THAN THE SON OF SAYYIDI A'LA HAZRAT (RADI ALLAHU ANHU) WHOSE BEAUTIFUL NAME IS MUSTAPHA RAZA AND THIS NAME COMES ON MY TONGUE WITHOUT PROBLEM AND IT ALLOWS ME TO GAIN GREAT BLESSINGS."" Once Hazrat Muhaddith-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu) wrote the following words on the Fatawa of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu): ""THIS IS THE SAYING OF SUCH AN AALIM WHOM TO FOLLOW IS COMPULSORY ""
Huzoor Sayyidi Hafiz-e-Millat (radi Allahu anhu) stated, ""A PERSON DOES NOT GET PROPER RESPECT AND ACCEPTANCE IN HIS OWN TOWN, BUT THE ACCEPTANCE AND RESPECT THAT HUZOOR MUFTI AZAM HAS GAINED IN HIS TOWN CANNOT BE FOUND ANYWHERE ELSE. THIS IS OPEN PROOF OF HIS KARAMAAT AND WILAYAT"". He then said, ""MUFTI AZAM IS A KING, HE IS A KING"". (Which means that he should be respected and treated as a King).
Huzoor Mujjahid-e-Millat (radi Allahu anhu) said, ""IN THIS TIME, THE PERSONALITY OF HUZOOR MUFTI AZM HIND (RADI ALLAHU ANHU) IS A UNIQUE ONE, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF IFTA, BUT ALSO IN HIS DAILY CONVERSATIONS - THE MANNER IN WHICH HE SPOKE AND EXPLAINED CAN BE UNDERSTOOD BY ONLY THE PEOPLE OF KNOWLEDGE.""
The ""Imam Ghazzali"" of his time, Allama Saeed Ahmad Kazmi Shah Sahib (radi Allahu anhu) says, ""THE STATUS OF SAYYIDI MUFTI AZAM HIND (RADI ALLAHU ANHU) CAN BE UNDERSTOOD FROM THIS THAT HE IS THE SON AND THE BELOVED OF MUJJADIDE DEEN-O-MILLAT, IMAM AHLE SUNNAT, ASH SHAH IMAM AHMAD RAZA KHAN (RADI ALLAHU ANHU).""
Hazrat Qari Maslihud'deen (radi Allahu anhu) says, ""AFTER THE WISAAL OF MY MURSHAD, THE CENTRAL POINT OF MY FOCUS WAS THE PERSONALITY OF HUZOOR MUFTI AZAM HIND (RADI ALLAHU ANHU) AND NOT ONLYWAS HE THE POINT OF MY FOCUS, BUT ALSO THAT OF THE ENTIRE SUNNI POPULATION.""
One of the greatest Karamats of a Mo'min is for him to be always steadfast on Shariat-e-Mustapha and Sunnat-e-Mustapha (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). A Mo'min must be prepared to accept all the difficulties and calamities of life. When faced by any calamity he should always make Shukr to Allah Almighty.
These outstanding qualities can be found in the life of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). He was always steadfast and firm on Shariat-e-Mustapha (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). It is said that it is impossible to move a mountain from its place but it was not possible to move Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) from the Shariat-e-Mustapha (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Every second in the life of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was a Karaamat. Volumes can be written about the Karaamats of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu). He himself is a living Karaamat!
""Kaha tak Raaz likhoge karaamat Mufti-e-Azam, Sarapa hi Sarapa he karaamat Mufti-e-Azam""
For the purpose of Fuyooz-o-barkaat we will quote one such Karaamat.
Once Hazrat went for the Urs of Hazrat Mahboob-e-Ilahi, Kwaja Nizaamud'deen Awliyah (radi Allahu anhu) to Delhi. He stayed at a place called 'Koocha Jilan' with Ashfaaq Ahmad Sahib. At this place, a certain Wahabi Maulvi began arguing with Hazrat concerning the Ilme Ghaib (Knowledge of the Unseen) of Huzoor Anwar (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Ashfaaq Ahmad Sahib asked Hazrat not to argue with this person as it would not make any difference to him. Hazrat said, ""Let him speak. I will listen to him and all those who are present should also listen attentively. The reason why nothing makes a difference to Maulvi Sahib is because nobody listens to him properly. So let him say that which he wishes."" Maulvi Saeedud'deen then spoke for approximately 15 minutes explaining how Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) did not possess Ilme Ghaib. He spoke for some time and then became silent.
Hazrat then said, ""If you have forgotten anything concerning your argument then please try to remember."" The Maulvi Sahib spent another half an hour trying to prove that Huzoor (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) did not possess Ilme Ghaib.
After listening to his arguments Hazrat said, ""You should immediately repent from your false belief. Allah has definitely blessed Huzoor (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) with Ilme Ghaib and you have tried to contradict it in every way you could. If you do not mind, then also listen to my argument"".
Then very sarcastically Hazrat said, ""What is the responsibility of a son towards his widowed mother?"" Maulvi Sahib in answer said, ""I will not answer this as it is not relevant to the topic of discussion"".
Hazrat then said, ""I did not mind when you questioned me, but in any case just listen to my questions. There is no need to answer them"".
The second question Hazrat asked was, ""How is it to take a loan from someone and then hide from him? Can you become weary of your crippled son and leave him to beg? To make Hajj Badal from... ""
This question was not yet completed when the Wahabi Maulvi fell at the feet of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and said, ""Hazrat! It is enough. The problem has been solved. Today I have realised that Huzoor (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) has Ilme Ghaib. If not by now the Munaafiqeen would have destroyed the Islamic Missions. If Almighty Allah has shown you those things about me which nobody else here knows about, then I cannot imagine all that which He has informed Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) of"".
The Wahabi Maulvi immediately repented and became Mureed of Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu).
Each year, Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) used to go to Calcutta for missionary work. The Pope used to also visit Calcutta and although he received good coverage in the media, very few Christians turned up to meet the Pope. The Christians of Calcutta became very jealous whenever Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) visited that city as, without any news coverage, he attracted thousands of people who came to see him.
The Christians decided to insult Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and lower his personality in the eyes of the people. They trained three Christians to approach Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) with the pretence that they were going to become his Mureeds. This was their plan: Whenever Hazrat was going to make any person his Mureed, he would ask the person to say, ""Say that you have given your hand into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu)."" The Christians where then going to say that Hazrat is a liar (Allah forbid) since that was not the hand of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu)!
The three Christians, now disguised as Muslims went to Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu) with the pretence of becoming his Mureed. When two of the Christians saw Hazrat's noorani face they became afraid of carrying out their plans, but the third Christian, who was very stubborn, decided to carry out the plan.
He sat in front of Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) and Hazrat proceeded with making him a Mureed. When Hazrat said, ""Say that you have given your hand into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu),"" he said, ""I am giving my hand in the hand of Mufti-e-Azam."" He was implying that Hazrat was asking him to lie when he was made to say a moment ago that he is not going to lie.
Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) again commanded him to say, ""Say that you have given your hand into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu)."" He again said, ""I am giving my hand in the hand of Mufti-e-Azam.""
Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) came into a Jalaal (Spiritual Anger) state and said, ""Say that you are giving your hands into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu)."" To the surprise of many, the Christian began continuously saying, ""I have given my hands into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam, I have my given hands into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu) . . ..""
When asked about his behavior, the Christian said that as Huzoor Mufti-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) commanded him for the final time to say that he has given his hands into the hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu), he actually saw two bright hands emerging from Hazrat's hands and the Christian says that he is sure that these hands were none other the mubarak hands of Ghous-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu).
That Christian then asked Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) for forgiveness and explained to him what his true intentions were. He immediately accepted Islam and became a Mureed. The news of this Karaamat spread far and wide and thousands of Christians accepted Islam at Hazrat's hands. Subhan-Allah! This incident was narrated by Hazrat Moulana Abdul Hamid Palmer Noori Razvi, a close Khalifa of Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu).
Huzoor Sayyidi Sarkaar Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) Mazaar Shareef is situated in Mohalla Saudagran, Bareilly Shareef. Every year thousands of Mureeds and lovers of Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu) present themselves at Bareilly Shareef for his Urs Mubaarak.
Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind (radi Allahu anhu's) Mureedeen were not only ordinary people but his Mureeds also consisted of great Ulema, Muftis, Mufassirs, Poets, Philosophers, Professors, Doctors, etc. It is said that he has millions of Mureedeen.
In India - Mufas'sire Azam Hind Hazrat Ibrahim Raza (radi Allahu anhu); Hazrat Maulana Tahseen Raza Khan; Hazrat Maulana Rehan Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu); Hazrat Allamah Mufti Mohammed Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari; Muhadithe Kabeer Hazrat Maulana Mufti Zia Ul Mustapaha Sahib; Hazrat Maulana Arshadul Qaadri Sahib.
His Eminence, Shaikh Mufti Mohammad Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari Al-Qaderi, was born on the 25th of Safar in the year 1942 in Bareilly, the citadel of spirituality and learning. He is the great grandson of A'la Hazrat, Shaikh Imam Ahmed Raza Fazil-e Barelvi (rahmatullahi alaih), the Mujaddid (Reviver) of Islam in the 14th Century Hijri.
Under the tutorship of renowned Ulama, he attained the degree of Fazile Deeniyat (Graduation in Islamic Theology) from Darul Uloom Manzare Islam, Bareilly. After spending three years (1963 - 1966) at the Al Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt, his Eminence post-graduated in Arabic Literature and Deeniyat with specialization in Ahadith (Prophetic Tradition) and Tafseer (Quranic Exegesis) with high distinctions.
On his return home, he joined Darul Uloom Manzare Islam, Bareilly Shareef. Thereafter, he left the Darul Uloom and established his own Darul-Ifta with the permission of his maternal grandfather, Huzoor Mufti-e-Azam Hind, Shaikh Mufti Muhammad Mustapha Raza Khan (rahmatullahi alaih). His Eminence, Mufti-e-Azam Hind (rahmatullahi alaih) declared him his Ja'Nashin (Successor) while the great Shaikh was present in this world.
His Eminence inherited the skill in the issuing of Fatawa (Legal Islamic Rulings) and in tackling the complex issues relating to Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) directly from Mufti-e-Azam (radi Allahu anhu) who inherited it directly from Mujaddid-e-Deen-o-Millat, Ash Shah Imam Ahmed Raza Bareilvi (rahmatullahi alaih).
He is not only the Successor and a trustworthy custodian of Fatawa writing of Shaikh Mufti-e-Azam Hind (rahmatullahi alaih), but also the custodian of learning, knowledge, sanctity and saintliness, of his grandfather, Hujjatul Islam, Moulana Muhammad Haamid Raza Khan (rahmatullahi alaihi).
His father, Moulana Muhammad Ibrahim Raza Khan Jilaani Mia (rahmatullahi alaih), was a great Aalim and Saint. He was well-versed in the commentary of the Holy Quran and so was given the title of Mufassir-e-Azam-e-Hind or Great Commentator of the Holy Quran in India.
His Eminence, Mufti Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari, travels extensively propagating the Deen and is a world-renowned preacher and a spiritual guide. Thousands of Muslims in India and abroad are attached with his Silsila. His Eminence has many Khulafa. He was also given the title of Taajush Shari'ah.
Besides being a great Mufti and Aalim, he is also a poet and an academic writer. His Diwan (Collection of Poems) was published for the first time entitled Naghmat-e-Akhtar. Later, it was published entitled Safina-e-Bakhshish in 1986, a chrono-grammical name, derived by Dr. Abdun Naim Azizi. Safina-e-Bakhshish includes Mufti Akhtar Raza Khan's Urdu and Arabic poems and was compiled and published by Dr. Abdun Naim Azizi. Many of Allama Mohammad Akhtar Raza's Naaths and Manqabats have not been published as yet.
Amongst his academic works, a few are as follows: (1) Taswiron Ka Hukm, (2) T.V. aur Video ka Operation, (3) Difae Kanzul Imaan, (4) Sharhe-Hadise Niyat, (5) Al-Haqqul Mobeen (Arabic), (6) Difa Kanzul Imaan Part I & II (7) Mer-atun-Najdi'ah (Arabic) (8) Hazrat Ibrahim ke Waalid Tariq ya Azar, etc.
His Darul-Ifta is now the central Darul Ifta of not only Bareilly Shareef, but of the Sunni world and he has continued the prestige of Fatawa writing of his grand-father and great grand-father. To date, he has written more than 5 000 Fatawa.Besides being well-versed in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu he has also a good knowledge of English. He has written many Fatawa in the English Language. The original book, Few English Fatawa, was first published by Edara Sunni Duniya, 82 Saudagran, Bareilly Shareef by his Eminence. Allama Mufti Naseem Ashraf Habibi, who is the Head Advisor and Mufti of the Imam Ahmed Raza Academy and of Sunni Ulama Council included a few more unpublished Fatawas, which was also written or orally dictated in English by Hazrat Azhari Sahib.
May Almighty Allah keep Hazrat Allama Mufti Mohammad Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari firm on Maslak-e-A'la Hazrat and serve as a beacon of guidance. May He grant his Eminence good health and long life. Aameen.","['Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind received Khilafat in the Qaderi, Chishti, Nakshbandi, Suharwardi, and Madaari Orders.']",8281,multifieldqa_en,en,,bda4a6b251a601b7f7f956f298b59d8e99993845c1eaf7d6," Ghousul Waqt, Mufti-e-Azam-e.Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was born on Monday, 22nd of Zil Hijjah 1310 AH (18 July 1892) in the. most beautiful city of Bareilly Shareef, India. His illustrious father, the Mujaddid (Reviver) of Islam, Imam- e-Ahle Sunnat, A'la Hazrat, Ash Shah Imam Ahmed Raza Khan Al Qaderi (1856 - 1921), was born in Mahrerah Shareef. On that very night, Sayyiduna A'LA Hazrat dreamt that he had been blessed with a son and in his dream he named his son ""Aale Rahmaan"" His Aqiqa was done on the name of ""Muhammad"", which was the tradition of the family. He also studied Kita under the guidance of Hazrat's elder brother, Maulana Ilahi Moulana Shahi Rahmid Raza. He gained proficiency in the many branches of Islamic knowledge, among which are: Tafsir, Hadith, Jurisprudence, and Fiqh. (Mufti Azam Hind Number, pg. 341). Not only did he receive Khilafat in the Qader i Silsila (Order), but also in the Chishti, Nakshbandi, Suharwardi, and Madaari Orders. Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) spent another 12 years writing Fatawas at the feet of A'la Hazrat. He continued this trend until his last breath. He was allowed to go for Hajj without a photograph in his passport and without taking any vaccinations. He married the blessed daughter of his paternal uncle. He had 6 daughters and one son, Hazrat Anwaar Raza, who passed away during childhood. He met those Ulema whom his father, Sayidduna A'LA Hazrat, met during his visit to Haramain Sharifain. They then requested Khilafat from Mufti-e-Azam-E-Hind. He then wrote the Fatawa concerning ""Raza'at"" - the very first Fatawa which he had written. The stamp which was given to him was mislaid during his second Hajj when his bags were lost. He also met Allamah Sayed Ameen Qutbi; Allamahs Sayed Abbas Alawi and Allamaha Sayed Noor Muhammad. They narrated many incidents which had taken place during Sayyiduna A’la HazRat’s visit to the Haramain. Sharifain in 1328 AH. The shining star of A'la Hazrat, Ash Shah Imam Ahmed Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu), the glitter and the hope for the hearts of millions throughout the world, the Mujaddid of the 15th Century, the Imam of his time. Hazrat was spiritally present for Jummah at the Nau Mahla Masjid. He asked, ""Did anybody tell you about the Namaaz? I will read Jumma Namaazi in Nau Mahlasjid"" Those present just gazed at each others faces and remained silent. Only later did they realise what Mufti-e-Azam-e.Hind (rad i AllahuAnhu) was implying. He was not only giving hope to the Mureedeen but also informing them of his Wisaal. The first person to notice this Karaamat was Hazrat Allamah Mohammed Akhtar Raza. Khan Azhari. The following persons were present during the Ghusl: Hazrat Maulana Rehan Raza, Hazrat Mohammad Akhtar, and his nephew Hazrat Rehan. The Wudhu was performed by Sayed Mustaaq Ali, Maulana Sayed Muhammad Husain, Sayed Chaif Sahib and Maulana Naeemullah Khan Sahib. Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) possessed great heights of good character, moral standards, kindness, sincerity, love and humbleness. His character was the true embodiment of the Sunnah of Sayyiduna Rasulullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). He shone like a star in the darkness of the night. He was definitely blessed with the characters of the ""Salfe Saliheen"" or The Pious Servants of Allah. He never refused the invitation of any poor Muslim. He always stayed away from those who were very wealthy and lavish. When he was physically fit he used go into the Visitors Section and ask each person whether they had eaten or not. He used to continuously enquire as to whether they were experiencing any difficulties. It was often seen that he would personally carry the dishes into the house for the visitors! He would give warm sheets and blankets to the poor and the needy. He personally tied the Amama (Turban) on their heads and personally tied a few hats and turbans on them. He gave Khilafat to many Ulema-I-Ikraam-I. Once, during winter, he gave cloaks, turbans and many hats to many people. All of his Mehfils were full of knowledge and Barkah. Many questions on Tassawuf were easily answered by him. He always advised them to mould their lives according to the principles and the commands of Islam. He stopped the Muslims from calling the governments as their ""Sarkaar"" or leaders. He never kept any ordinary Kitaab on the books of Tafseer or Hadith. Whenever he sat in a Meelad-un-Nabi (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) or Mehfil-e-Zikr, he always sat with utmost respect until the very end. On entering the Masjid, he would immediately recite the dua prescribed. He would wash all the parts thoroughly so that the Sunnn would be lost in the worship of his Creator. The person who looked at him from a distance would have instantly understood that it was time for Maghrib. The people told him immediately when he disembarked from the train. He had left all worldly desires and was pleasing to the Creator. Once, while Mufti-E-Azam-e.Hind (radi Allahu anhu) was traveling from Nagpur to Karachi, he was given a shawl. Although the Moulana refused to accept it, he gave it to him. Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was drowned in the love for the Holy Prophet, Sayyiduna Rasulullah. Most of his poems were in the form of Humd (Praise of Allah), Naath Shareef, Qasidas and Manqabats compiled in the Arabic, Urdu, Persian and Hindi languages. He used to celebrate the Meelad-un-Nabi (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) each year with great splendour. He would sit for hours with great respect in the Naath Mehfils and would shed tears in his love for Sayyidsullah. The respect and honour that the world showed him was out of this world. The great Ulema of the time have stated that Mufti-e-Azam-a-Hind (rad i Allahu) used to walk bare feet behind him. He was a giant of his time. His poems are still available toady. Samaane Bakhshish is a treasure chest which flows with pearls of love forSayyidun Rasoolullah (s allal laauh alaih was allam). He was also a great poet. He wrote the poem ""Ye Dil Ye Jigr Hai Ye Aankhe Ye Sar Hai, Jaha Chaaho Rakho Qadam Ghauseaz"" Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) is one of the greatest leaders of the Sunnis. His boldness and fearlessness is difficult to explain. His entire life was spent speaking against Deobandis, Wahabis and all the other misleading sects. He always propagated the true Deen and the Path of the Ahle Sunnah Wa Jamaah. With his Fatawas, he helped protect the Imaan of not only the Muslims in India and Pakistan, but of Muslims throughout the world. He did everything in his capacity to challenge the enemies of Islam. No person in his presence could say or do anything against Shariah. He never submits himself before an enemy. In the worst of circumstances a Mo'min announces that which is the truth. Sayyiduna Rasulullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) said, ""To speak the truth before a tyrant King is a great Jihad."" So imagine the excellence of a person who always spoke the truth at all times, a personwho always raised the flag of truth and honesty, and a personWho never left the path of truth in his entire life! Mufti-i-Azam-e-Hind, MoulanaMustaphaRaza Khan. Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) was given the status of Mufti due to his immense knowledge. He was a personality free from pride, lavishness and self- fame. His status was bestowed upon him by Almighty Allah and His Beloved Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) This is one of the reasons why the entire world was brightened and received the benefits of his knowledge of Fiqh. During the reign of General Ayub Khan a ""Rooyat Hilal Committee"" was formed in Pakistan for the purpose of sighting the moon for every Islamic Month. An aeroplane was flown up to a certain height and the moon would be sighted from there. This form of Shahaadah (Confirmation) of the sighting of the moon via an aeroplanes was readily accepted by the Pakistani Government. In this manner, Eid was celebrated. Many Ulema replied that the confirmation had to be accepted and that it was permissible, but Muft i-Azam-e-Hind replied that this was not permissible. His Fatawa read as follows:"" The Command of the Moon and the Shariah is to give an decision in connection with a decision to celebrate Eid. The moon should not be seen from the ground or attached to any place attached to the ground"" The year 1976 was a very difficult period for the Muslims in India. Certain Ulema, bought of by the Saudi Riyals and American Dollars, passed the Fatawa making Vasectomy (male sterilization to prevent birth of children) permissible. The Indian Government made Vasectomy necessary for every male in India at that time. All of a sudden that Mujahhid of Islam rose with the torch of knowledge and light against the winds of enmity and destruction. He immediately issued the true Fatawa on vasectomy and said, ""Vasectomy is Haraam, HaraAm,Haraam."" This news spread throughout India. Through the Dua and firmness of Mufti-e-Azam-E-Hind on this issue, the Government that wished to pass this law had lost power, and a new government came into power. The law on Vasectomy was abolished! Once, Maulana Abdul Hadi Al Qaderi and Soofi Iqbal Sahib asked Ghousul Waqt: ""Huzoor! Can one remember his Sheikh in Namaaz?"" He replied: ""If, in this way, the thought of one's Peer comes into the mind, then there is no hindrance"". Subhan-Allah! This answer has also contradicted the Deobandi belief. Moulana Mustapha Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) immediately said, ""It was commanded to Hazrat Adam (alaihis salaam) and Hazrat Hawa"" (as follows): 'Walakum fil Ardi Mustaqar' On hearing this, Allama Mirati Sahib became silent. To be Mustqar means to be stationary in your surrounding, not to come out of your boundaries. To move but to move within your boundaries of movement. He was always steadfast and firm on Shariat-e-Mustapha and Sun-Mustallal laahu alaihi. Mo'min must be prepared to accept all difficulties and calamities of life. When faced by any calamity, he should always make the Shukr always make Shrukr to Allah Almighty. It is said that it is impossible to move a mountain from its place but it was not possible to move Mufti-i-Azam-e. Allahu-radi (RadiAllahu-Hindi) He was one of the greatest Karamats of a Mo'rein (Karamat) who was always prepared for all calamities. He is the son of Sayyidi A'LA HAZRAT (RADI ALLAHU ANHU) Maulvi Saeedud'deen spoke for approximately 15 minutes explaining how Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) did not possess Ilme Ghaib. After listening to his arguments Hazrat said, ""You should immediately repent from your false belief"" The Wahabi Maulvi immediately repented and became Mureed of Mufti-e-Azam-e.Hind (radi Allahu anhu) The Christians of Calcutta became very jealous whenever Mufto Mufta visited that city as, without any news coverage, he attracted thousands of people who came to see him. The Christians decided to insult him and lower his personality in the eyes of the people. They trained three Christians to approach him with the pretence that they were going to become his Mureeds. When Hazrat asked them to say, ""Say that you have given your hand into the hands of Ghous-e.-Azam,"" one of them replied, ""I am giving my hand in the hand of Huzoor"" Hazrat then proceeded with making him aMureed. He was implying that Hazrat was not asking him to lie and that he was asking to say that he had given his hand to him a moment ago. He is the great grandson of A'la Hazrat, the Mujaddid (Reviver) of Islam in the 14th Century Hijri. His Eminence, Shaikh Mufti Mohammad Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari Al-Qaderi, was born on the 25th of Safar in the year 1942 in Bareilly, the citadel of spirituality and learning. Every year thousands of Mureedeen present themselves at Bareilly Shareef for his Urs Mubaarak. The news of this Karaamat spread far and wide and thousands of Christians accepted Islam at Hazrat's hands. He inherited the skill in issuing the Fatawa (Legal Rulings) in the Islamic world from his grandfather, HuzoorMufti-e-Azam Hind, the great Shaikh of Hind, while his great-grandfather was present in this world. He is also the great-great-grandson of Shaikh Imam Ahmed Raza Fazil-e Barelvi (rahmatullahi alaih), the great Imam of Hind. He was born in 1942 and grew up in the town of Bareilly in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. He studied at Darul Uloom Manzare Islam, Bareilly and the Al Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. His Eminence, Mufti Akhtar Raza Khan Azhari, travels extensively propagating the Deen. Thousands of Muslims in India and abroad are attached with his Silsila. To date, he has written more than 5 000 Fatawa. His Darul-Ifta is now the central Darul Ifta of not only Bareilly Shareef, but of the Sunni world. He has continued the prestige of Fatawa writing of his grand-father and great-grand-father. May Almighty Allah keep Hazrat AllamaMufti Mohammad AkhtarRaza Khan. Azhari firm on Maslak-e-A'la Hazrat and serve as a beacon of guidance. Aameen. May He grant his Eminence good health and long life."
What was the reason given by Governor Rick Scott for not implementing a prescription drug monitoring database in Florida?,"How Oxycontin, Florida and the Sackler Family Created the Opioid Crisis In America
Why are the Sacklers worth $13 billion today? Answer: “The Oxy Express Explained”
(MASS TORT NEXUS MEDIA)
A COMPARISON OF OXYCODONE PRESCRIBING
In the first six months of 2010, Ohio doctors and health care practitioners bought the second-largest number of oxycodone doses in the country at just under 1 million pills.
Florida doctors bought 40.8 million in the same period, the comparison is astounding, yet it flew under the DEA, Opioid Big Pharma and everyone elses radar for years and years.
Of the country’s top 50 oxycodone-dispensing clinics, 49 were in Florida. From August 2008 to November 2009, a new pain clinic opened in Broward and Palm Beach counties on average of every three days.
Pharmacies and distributors are at fault as well, pharmacies ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from opioid drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies.
90 of 100 of the nation’s top 100 oxy-buying doctors in 2010, were in Florida. 49 of 50 of the country’s top oxy-dispensing clinics were in Florida. For some reason this didn’t raise an alarm or cause anyone to look further at the time.
Purdue Pharma New What Was Happening In Florida
Purdue and the Sacklers chose to ignore Florida, because apparently nobody there sued them or complained. In 2007, in other states, the infamous drug maker and three of its executives pled guilty in federal court and paid out $634.5 million in fines for purposefully misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the addictiveness of their opioid painkiller. Around the same time, Purdue was also sued by several states, including Washington, over similar allegations. Purdue agreed to a $19.5 million multi-state settlement. And in 2015, Purdue settled a case with Kentucky, agreeing to pay $24 million.
As part of the state settlements, Purdue was supposed to set up monitoring programs to make sure that its opioid drug didn’t wind up in the wrong hands. It was supposed to watch out for shady pharmacies, unusually large orders, or suspiciously frequent orders. But on this front, Everett alleges that Purdue once again put profits over people.
Obviously, this was ignored as the Florida based “Oxy Expres”; rolled on for years and years with np input, comment or oversight by Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family other than “show me the money” and enjoying a life of luxury on the misery created and managed in the Purdue Pharma boardroom. But, the Purdue boardroom isn’t the only guilty “Opioid Big Pharma” industry player who designed and supported the opioid prescribing crisis.
For the current status of efforts to make Opioid Big Pharma accept responsibility in litigation filed in federal and state courts across the country, see: https://www.masstortnexus.com/Briefcases/254/OPIOID-CRISIS-BRIEFCASE-INCLUDING-MDL-2804-OPIATE-PRESCRIPTION-LITIGATION
Why Distributors Are Liable
Cardinal Health, one of the nation’s biggest distributors, sold two CVS pharmacies in Sanford a combined 3 million doses of oxycodone, flooding the town of 54,000 with an average of 250,000 oxycodone pills every month.
West of Jupiter, a Walgreens drug distribution center sold 2.2 million tablets to a single Walgreens’ pharmacy in tiny Hudson, a roughly six-month supply for each of its 12,000 residents. It shipped more than 1.1 million pills to each of two Fort Pierce Walgreens pharmacies.
For 40 days starting in late 2010, the distribution center shipped 3,271 bottles of oxycodone — 327,100 doses of the drug — to a Port Richey Walgreens pharmacy, prompting a distribution manager to ask: “How can they even house this many bottles?”
There were 53 million oxycodone prescriptions filled in 2013 by US pharmacies, according to NIDA. This translates to approximately one bottle of this addictive drug for every 6 people in the country. How was this not noticed by those responsible for monitoring narcotics prescribing in the United States?

HOW WEST VIRGINIA WAS TARGETED
It-Was-Raining-Opiates-How-drug-companies-submerged-West-Virginia-in-opioids-for-years
Reliably red on the political map, Huntington is a West Virginia town with a 182-year-old university, a storied football team and more than 100 churches.
It’s where Will Lockwood graduated from high school. It’s where he enrolled at Marshall University. It’s where he first tried OxyContin. By the time Lockwood entered Marshall, Detroit dealers were trickling into Huntington, selling OxyContin and pills with OxyContin’s active ingredient, oxycodone.
Even though Lockwood could step out his front door and get the drug, Detroit street dealers weren’t the preferred supplier, they were in Florida.
It may have been 1,000 miles away, but to Lockwood, getting OxyContin and oxycodone from Florida’s loosely regulated pain clinics “was legal, in a sense.”
Twice a month, different “crews” from Huntington crowded into vans and headed south to Palm Beach and Broward counties, home to more than 200 pill mills, the pain clinics where anyone with a fake ache and hard cash could walk out with pills and prescriptions.
After hitting a string of clinics, the Huntington crews drove back with “around 500 to 600 pills per person,” said Lockwood.
But it wasn’t just a few hundred pills. It was tens of thousands.
And it wasn’t just Huntington, The West Virginia vans were part of a nationwide caravan heading to South Florida. Cars bearing tags from Kentucky, Tennessee, the Carolinas, Virginia and Ohio crowded into one clinic parking lot after another, loading up on pills and prescriptions.
News stories and law enforcement focused on those “parking lot” states in Appalachia, where dealers and addicts with a tank of gas or a cheap plane ticket traveled the “Oxy Express” to Palm Beach and Broward.
But Florida’s pill pipeline reached far beyond those roadways.
By 2010, Florida was the oxycodone drug dealer of choice for drug users and dealers in the Great Lakes, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions as well as the Southeast, DEA records show, an area spanning virtually every state east of the Mississippi. It wasn’t just that Florida guaranteed a flow of cheap oxycodone. For 10 years, key lawmakers and agency heads repeatedly looked the other way as crooked doctors and bogus clinics flooded almost half the nation with the highly addictive drug.
In failing to crack down, Florida extended by years the amount of time highly addictive oxycodone would be available to both first-time experimenters and addicts. It gave criminals the raw materials for trafficking. It gave Will Lockwood the OxyContin needed to feed his growing habit, It paved the way for his eventual jump to heroin.
Jumping state lines
Teenage high-school wrestling buddies in New Port Richey ran oxycodone into Tennessee; they were paid with cash hidden in teddy bears. A Hillsborough County man mailed 17,000 pills to Glen Fork, W.Va., a month’s supply for every man woman and child in the tiny town.
A Boston Chinatown crime boss trafficked pills from Sunrise into Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and South Carolina. Wellington twins and pill mill kingpins Paul and Phil George, brothers who oversaw one of the largest operations in the country from their five Palm Beach and Broward clinics, pushing oxycodone into Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio and South Carolina.
A husband and wife team operating out of a Forest Hill Boulevard clinic funneled pills to Delaware. At Palm Beach International Airport, two federal security agents accepted $500 a pop each time they waved through thousands of pillsbound for Connecticut and New York.
A Palm Bay man’s Puerto Rican family bought local pills destined for the working class town of Holyoke, Mass. In Rhode Island, police pulled over a Lauderhill man caught speeding through Providence. They found 903 oxycodone tablets and 56 morphine pills in the car.
Senior citizen and Tulane business graduate Joel Shumrak funneled more than 1 million pills into eastern Kentucky from his South Florida and Georgia clinics, much of it headed for street sales — an estimated 20 percent of the illicit oxycodone in the entire state.
Van loads of pill-seekers organized by “VIP buyers” traveled from Columbus, Ohio, to three Jacksonville clinics, where armed guards handled crowd control (federal indictment) and doctors generated prescriptions totaling 3.2 million pills in six months. In Miami, Vinny Colangelo created 1,500 internet website names to entice drug users throughout the nation to one of his six South Florida pain clinics or pharmacies.
Even the Mafia got in on the Florida oxy express action: A Bonanno crime family associate oversaw a local crew stocking up on Palm Beach and Broward pain clinic oxycodone, upstreaming profits to the New York family.
At times, it seemed almost no section of the country was free of Florida-supplied pills: When Olubenga Badamosi was arrested driving his Bentley Continental in Miami in 2011, the Oregon man was one of two traffickers overseeing a crew smuggling South Florida oxycodone to sell in Salt Lake City, Seattle and Denver as well as Oregon, Nevada, Texas and even Alaska.
Pharmacy delivers oxy ‘pot of gold’
It would be hard to overstate Florida’s role in feeding the country’s voracious appetite for oxycodone. Oxycodone 30-milligram tablets were favored by addicts. And in 2009 and 2010, roughly four of every 10 of those pills were sold in Florida. Small wonder: Of the nation’s top 100 oxycodone-buying doctors, 90 were in Florida.
Pharmacies, too, ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from drug distributors, the middlemen between manufacturers and pharmacies.
West of Jupiter, a Walgreens drug distribution center sold 2.2 million tablets to a single Walgreens’ pharmacy in tiny Hudson, a roughly six-month supply for each of its 12,000 residents. It shipped more than 1.1 million pills to each of two Fort Pierce Walgreens pharmacies. By contrast, a single Walgreens pharmacy in the Central Florida townOviedo bought 169,700 doses of oxycodone in 30 days.
People on both sides of the counter knew what was going on: In a letter to the chief executive of Walgreens, Oviedo’s police chief warned that people were walking out of the town’s two Walgreens stores and selling their drugs on the spot, crushing and snorting them, or — still in the pharmacy’s parking lot — injecting them.
Why Pharmacies are LIABLE
In Fort Pierce, a Walgreens pharmacist accidentally provided an extra 120 oxycodone pills to a customer. When the druggist called to ask that the man return the pills, the customer’s girlfriend bluntly responded that he was an addict, that he sold oxycodone and the 120 pills were “a pot of gold,” DEA records show.
That was in September. The same man came back to the same Walgreens in December and January with a prescription in hand, and the pharmacy filled his prescriptions every time.
‘Wild West of Oxycodone Prescribing’
Cincinnati-based Masters Pharmaceuticals Inc. was a middling-sized drug distributor selling oxycodone to Florida pharmacies.
It sold to other customers in other states. But mostly, it sold to Florida: Oxycodone made up more than 60 percent of its drug sales in 2009 and 2010, according to federal records. Of its top 55 oxycodone customers, 44 were in Florida.
Company CEO Dennis Smith worried that the Florida-bound oxycodone was getting in the wrong hands. A trip to Broward did nothing to ease his mind. “It was,” he later testified, “the Wild West of oxycodone prescribing.”
Bus and park benches touted pain clinics. When Smith picked up and thumbed through City Beat, a free magazine, he found pages of ads for pain clinics. “It would show young people sitting around a pool and it named the pain clinic and say (sic) ‘we dispense on site,’ and that really hit home hard.”
Smith stopped selling to pain clinics. But the company continued to shovel millions of oxycodone pills to Florida pharmacies. Masters executives figured the pharmacies would keep an eye out for excessive prescriptions written by pill mill doctors. But not all pharmacies were worrying about doctors at pain clinics, many pharmacies were courting the pill mills prescribers.
A Lake Worth Family Pharmacy
In 2009, the small pharmacy off Lucerne Avenue in Lake Worth had a history. It had been in business for 43 years. The owner and head pharmacist had been there for 32. It had shaded parking and a downtown location, a stone’s throw from the City Hall Annex.
When a Masters inspector visited, he was alarmed to find Tru-Valu Drugs bustling with a long line of young, thin, tattooed customers arriving in groups of 10 to pick up pills. There were signs in the pharmacy warning of limits on the number of oxycodone pills handed out. Even Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, an oxycodone manufacturer, was worried about the volume of its pill sales there.
Of the 300,000 doses of all drugs the small pharmacy dispensed in December 2008, 192,000 were for oxycodone 30 mg, the dosage preferred by traffickers and users alike.
The huge oxycodone volume was no accident. The owner and head pharmacist, unidentified in DEA records, told a Masters inspector that the pharmacy “has pushed for this (narcotic) business with many of the area pain doctors.”
And, despite the torrent of oxycodone going out the door, the pharmacy owner expressed frustration that drug distributors were limiting the amount of narcotics they would sell to his now-closed pharmacy.
Ohio to Florida and Back
Pharmacy after pharmacy benefited from the combination of Masters’ Ohio oxycodone business and Florida’s unregulated pill mills.
In Englewood, north of Fort Myers, the pharmacy owner filled prescriptions for six pain clinics — including clinics an hour’s drive away. A Masters inspector found cars from Tennessee and Kentucky in the parking lot and young men leaving the pharmacy carrying large trash bags.
Superior Pharmacy not only filled oxycodone prescriptions for pain clinics, it shared waiting room space with a pain clinic in a Temple Terrace strip mall outside Tampa. Neither Masters nor Superior had so much as Googled the background of pain clinic doctors writing those prescriptions, the DEA later said.
Had they done so, the DEA dryly noted, they “would likely have come across a press release” announcing one of the doctors had been arrested and charged with trafficking in prescription drugs.
Hundreds of thousands of oxycodone pills were sent from Ohio distributors to Florida pharmacies. Unknown thousands of pills headed right back up to Ohio.
When Ohio police burst into Christopher Thompson’s home outside Columbus, they found an assault rifle, $80,000 in cash and oxycodone from his Florida deals. A construction worker whose own pill habit started at age 14, Thompson oversaw a ring of 15 Ohio buyers who traveled to Florida to pick up oxycodone to resell in Central Ohio.
Two hours to the west in Martin’s Ferry, David L. Kidd orchestrated a ring of buyers traveling to West Palm Beach and Central Florida to pick up oxycodone for resale on the streets of eastern Ohio and West Virginia.
Doctors and pharmacies from Florida were complicit with Kidd’s ring in fueling Ohio’s opioid epidemic, wrote the U.S. attorney for West Virginia after Kidd’s 2011 arrest: “The steady flow of pain pills into the Ohio Valley from Florida must stop.”
Driving To Pick Up Death By Rx
With more drugs came more deaths, in January 2010, say police, Fort Lauderdale pathologist Dr. Lynn Averill started a seven-month oxycodone shopping spree, buying 437,880 oxycodone pills from drug distributors.
The same month, Matthew Koutouzis drove from Toms River, N.J., to see Averill in her Broward County pain clinic. The 26-year-old collected prescriptions for 390 pills and overdosed two days later. Brian Moore traveled 13 hours from his Laurel County, Ky., home to see Averill. He left with prescriptions for 600 pills and also overdosed within 48 hours.
Kenneth Hammond didn’t make it back to his Knoxville, Tenn., home. He had a seizure after picking up prescriptions for 540 pills and died in an Ocala gas station parking lot.
Keith Konkol didn’t make it back to Tennessee, either. His body was dumped on the side of a remote South Carolina road after he overdosed in the back seat of a car the same day of his clinic visit. He had collected eight prescriptions totaling 720 doses of oxycodone, methadone, Soma and Xanax. Konkol had every reason to believe he would get those prescriptions: In three previous visits to the Plantation clinic, he had picked up prescriptions for 1,890 pills.
An estimated 60 percent of her patients were from out of state, a former medical assistant told the DEA. In 2015, Averill pleaded not guilty to eight manslaughter charges. She is awaiting trial in Broward County. Averill was just one doctor at just one clinic. In 2010, the year Averill’s patients overdosed, Florida received applications to open 1,026 more pain clinics.
An online message board advising drug users summed it up: “Just go anywhere in South Florida and look for a ‘pain management clinic.’ It shouldn’t be too hard; you can’t swing a dead cat without hitting one.” Complain about anything from a back injury to a hangnail, it advised, “and they’ll set you right up.”
By this time, Kentucky had reined in its pill mills. It didn’t matter, Ohio, Delaware, North Carolina, Connecticut acted as well, but other state’s efforts didn’t matter either, Florida continued ignoring the pill mills and rogue doctors feeding the nation’s oxycodone habit, the pills flowed.
“There were folks down there, where if I had an opportunity to, get my hands around their throat, I would have wrung their neck,” said Huntington Mayor Steve Williams. On Florida’s inaction he stated, “There was total evidence as to what was happening. It lays at the foot, in my opinion, of the public officials there that allowed it to continue on.”
Governor Jeb Bush Backed A Solution
One of the first dinners Florida Gov. Jeb Bush hosted after moving into the governor’s mansion in 1999 was a small one. Among those sitting at the table with Bush were Lt. Gov. Toni Jennings, state Sen. Locke Burt and James McDonough, who would become the state’s hard-nosed drug czar. There was an urgent topic on the agenda that night: the explosion of prescription painkillers. For the state’s first family, it may have been personal. Bush had talked publicly about one of his children’s struggle with addiction.
By the time the meal ended, all had agreed on the need for establishing a prescription drug monitoring program that would collect information and track prescriptions written for controlled substances, such as oxycodone.
Absent a prescription drug monitoring database, there was no way to know whether someone was “doctor shopping,” going from doctor to doctor, getting more and more prescriptions to feed their habit.
And there was no way to know whether a doctor was overprescribing, key to pinpointing whether a pill mill was operating, and where. Similar databases had been adopted by more than a dozen states. It was being described as a “silver bullet” to curb overprescribing. Soon enough, $2 million to get the database up and running would be on the table — but it came with a catch.
Florida Attorney General Misfires Against Purdue
In 2001, OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma was fending off early criticism of its blockbuster painkiller. At issue was whether Purdue’s aggressive marketing campaign had misled doctors and patients alike. Purdue and three top executives later pleaded guilty to federal charges of illegally marketing the drug. Far from being safe and non-addictive, OxyContin carried the same addiction risk as morphine, and was every bit as potent.
But that was six years away. In 2001, towns in Maine reported an alarming uptick in crime tied to OxyContin. The first of several congressional hearings was ramping up. Critics and parents who lost children were piling on. Reporters were starting to write stories.
In November, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth appeared poised to take on the company. Calling OxyContin street sales “a major threat to public health,” Butterworth told a state Board of Medicine committee that Purdue should consider temporarily taking the drug off the market. It wasn’t only traffickers concerning Butterworth. It was the sales pitch.
In late 2001, Butterworth called a young assistant attorney general into his office and gave him a magazine article on OxyContin and an assignment: Look into Purdue marketing. Former Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth and Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg. The young lawyer, now-Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg, said he knew nothing about OxyContin. But he didn’t like what he read.
During the yearlong inquiry, 589 Floridians died after taking oxycodone. Nothing criminal was found, Aronberg later said. Instead, Butterworth and Purdue struck a settlement. As part of a $2 million deal, Purdue would pay to establish a prescription monitoring database, the same silver bullet sought by Bush. After Florida’s computerized system was up and running, the same system would be free to any other state. The entire country, not just Florida, would benefit.
It could have been a groundbreaking deal. There was one catch. State lawmakers had to vote to create the prescription monitoring program by 2004, or Purdue would keep its money.
Marco Rubio Kills The Anti-Oxy Rx Bill
A political gight killed the program. “And there was one person who was responsible,” said former state Sen. Burt, now an Ormond Beach insurance executive. “And it was Marco Rubio.”
A rising state lawmaker in 2002, now-U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio had the clout to make or break the legislation. He had been one of two state House majority whips and was on the fast track to becoming House speaker.
Rubio didn’t kill the 2002 bill out of opposition to prescription monitoring—it was politics “as usual” yet nobody blamed Rubio for the resulting opioid crisis that seems to have started in his political backyard and flourished beyond belief..
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was a leader in the Florida House in 2002 when he blocked a vote on prescription monitoring. That year, Rubio favored a bill changing the Miami-Dade County charter, which failed to pass because of a single “no” vote in the Senate. Burt cast the vote.
Angered by what he saw as Burt’s betrayal, Rubio killed the prescription drug monitoring bill. “When I found out he broke his word, it made the choice easy,” Rubio told The Miami Herald.
It’s not certain that the full Legislature would have passed the bill had it made it to a floor vote. Rubio was the first, not the last, in a line of state legislative leaders over years who would refuse to seriously consider the bill. Most cited privacy concerns.
But prescription monitoring databases in Florida and other states free to use Florida’s model would have pinpointed rogue doctors, would-be pill mills and doctor-shoppers across the country, just as all three were beginning to converge. In doing so, it could have curbed a national opioid epidemic when it was just an emerging problem, not the monster it would become.
Only weeks after the 2002 bill was killed, Bush suppressed a sob as he discussed his daughter’s arrest for forging a prescription. Court-ordered to drug treatment and then briefly to jail, Noelle Bush survived her pill addiction. The 2004 deadline for greenlighting a monitoring system passed. So did Purdue’s million-dollar obligation to pay for it.
Between 2002, the year Rubio killed the database that could have identified doctor-shoppers, and late 2011, when the database finally came online, more than 20,800 Floridians died after taking prescription opioids, including OxyContin, annual Florida Medical Examiners’ reports show. “Not getting that bill through the Legislature resulted in Florida becoming the pill mill capital of the United States,” said Burt.
“There was heartache for thousands of families beyond measure and it didn’t have to happen.”
Florida Officials Were Told Of The Oxy Express
The East Kentucky hills and valleys of Greenup County suit Keith Cooper, a long-haired undercover cop-turned-sheriff: “It’s a backwater. I tell people all the time I am a hick sheriff from a hick location, and by 2011, the rural county and its sheriff had big city problems.
Greenup is near the stretch of interstate highways that provided drug traffickers and users with a straight shot to Palm Beach and Broward pill mills. It’s less than an hour’s ride to Huntington Tri-State Airport, where a $27 flight to Fort Lauderdale was a popular draw for dealers hoping to stock up.
Arrests for Florida pills soon eclipsed local arrests for pot.
“When we locked ’em up, we take all their pill bottles and all their paperwork, and we found maps to the doctors offices and everything,” recalled Cooper.
“I called the (Florida) medical board and gave them a big list of doctors,” Cooper said. He called the state pharmacy board, too. He got no response.
“So then I called the Attorney General’s Office and the Governor’s Office. I was calling them all, the whole state. Of course, I was talking to the state police the entire time. “I told them, all of the profits were down there. And all of the pain’s up here.” Nothing happened. Florida’s oxycodone pipeline continued to flow.
On the other side of the law in Greenup, Mikey Frazier was banking on it.
The Oxy Express
Frazier was on a scholarship to play baseball at his junior college in Chicago when he suffered a torn rotator cuff. Doctors prescribed Percocet, a pill containing oxycodone, in 2002. When doctors cut him off, he bought it on the street. In 2006, he moved to OxyContin, nearly pure oxycodone. In 2007, he gave his friends money to go to Florida and bring him back pills.
“My buddy had a minivan and he would actually go down one week and take two to three people with him, and then the following week I’d go,” said Frazier. He still remembers the route: “I’d take 64 East to 77 South to 95 South. And it’s just a straight shot.”
Others followed suit. “What got everyone started was because the doctors around here won’t write a strong enough prescription,” he recalled. OxyContin and generic oxycodone still could be had — just not in Kentucky, which had a prescription drug monitoring database.
In Florida, “there was none of that … stuff that they check and find out what doctor you’ve been to,” said Frazier.
“And one person does it, and then they tell a friend, and then they go do it, and that’s how it all really got started here.”
MEDICAID-MEDICAIRE PAID MILLIONS FOR OXY
Tallahassee wasn’t just ignoring the epidemic, It was financing it.
Before her office was raided by law enforcement in December 2001, Asuncion M. Luyao’s patients would wait in a line in the rain to get prescriptions from the Port St. Lucie internist and acupuncturist. She was one of the most prolific prescribers of OxyContin in the state.
And hundreds of thousands of those pills were being paid for by Medicaid, Florida’s taxpayer-financed health program for the state’s poorest and sickest citizens. Between 1999 and 2001, Medicaid shelled out $935,634 for OxyContin prescriptions written by Luyao. That was just OxyContin. Luyao was prescribing an array of addictive drugs. In the 12 months leading up to the clinic raid, Medicaid paid roughly $1 million for 7,000 prescriptions, only about 17 percent of them for OxyContin.
Nor did the raid slow her down. Between the raid and her arrest on trafficking charges four months later, Luyao wrote another 282 OxyContin prescriptions billed to Medicaid. She was not an outlier. In 24 months, taxpayers footed the bill for more than 49 million doses of pills containing oxycodone, even though there were only 1.36 million Medicaid patients. Half were children.
The sheer volume of pills might have been a tipoff that the drugs were not all intended for legitimate use. So were arrest reports dating to 2001. One man had used his 7-year-old son’s Medicaid number to doctor-shop for OxyContin. A Miramar pharmacist who billed Medicaid $3.7 million for OxyContin pills was charged with paying Medicaid patients $150 each to use their IDs.
Medicaid paid for more than $300,000 to fill Dr. James Graves’ OxyContin prescriptions. The Florida Panhandle physician was the first doctor in the nation convicted of killing patients by overprescribing OxyContin.
Addiction risk for people taking high doses of oxycodone begins climbing after just three days, a recent study concluded. And most people on Florida Medicaid getting oxycodone prescriptions in 2011 were getting much more than a few days worth. They were getting an average of nine months worth of pills, state officials said.
Pill mill doctors prescribed 1 million of those pills:
Doctors working for the George twins’ trafficking empire prescribed at least 102,081 oxycodone pills billed to Medicaid before the ring collapsed in 2010.
Working out of a Delray Beach pain clinic founded by a convicted drug smuggler, Zvi Harry Perper, son of the Broward County medical examiner, was arrested on trafficking charges, but not before he wrote prescriptions to Medicaid patients for 115,977 doses of oxycodone in 90 days.
In Lake Worth, Cesar Deleon was arrestedas part of a DEA pill mill sweep and charged with 55 counts of illegally distributing drugs. Deleon wrote orders for 20,302 oxycodone pills for Medicaid patients.
Miami internist Dr. Selwyn Carrington authorized 32,411 doses of oxycodone for Medicaid patients in just two years. He was busted for signing his name to hundreds of prescriptions.
Further, Florida wasn’t in any hurry to stop doctors linked to pill mills.
Carrington was arrested for overprescribing in March 2011. The state’s emergency order to suspend his license was signed months after he had pleaded guilty in 2012.
Perper was busted at a Delray Beach pill mill operated by a former felon in 2011. The state did not act against his license until 2014.
Joseph M. Hernandez was writing prescriptions from his car, a veritable pill mill on wheels, when he was busted in February 2010 on one count of trafficking in oxycodone.
.Florida’s Department of Health didn’t file paperwork to restrict his license for almost 18 months.
During that time, Hernandez wrote oxycodone prescriptions for Medicaid patients totaling 258,940 doses representing a taxpayer-footed bill of $130,165.
Purdue Pharma’s Profits Before Patients Creed
Kelly Skidmore is exactly the type of person Purdue Pharma’s OxyContin marketing was intended to reach: Diagnosed with juvenile arthritis, the former state legislator’s struggle with chronic pain began at age 4.
Skidmore was wary of opioid painkillers, though, one reason her willingness in 2009 to work with Purdue was surprising. But she did it to get Florida’s dormant drug monitoring database up and running.
Then a state representative in a district straddling Palm Beach and Broward counties, Skidmore recalled that, “They came to me and said, ‘Could you help get it across the finish line?’ ”
OxyContin and prescription opioids, a serious problem in 2002, had evolved into a full-blown crisis in the ensuing seven years. Broward alone had more pain clinics than it had McDonald’s. Deaths tied to oxycodone had exploded, up by 263 percent since the prescription monitoring database had first been proposed and killed. Overdoses from prescription opioids were claiming more than seven lives a day.
“By God, if we had had seven dolphins a day dying and washing up on Florida beaches, we would have been appropriating money and solving it,” Skidmore said.
Skidmore believed a database wasn’t going to resolve the underlying addiction crisis. Still, it was a start. Not a silver bullet, but “maybe silver buckshot,” she said. The database law passed with gaping loopholes. No health care professional would have to report opioid prescriptions or check the database before prescribing more, and the state refused to pay for it.
“Just to get that one little piece … took nine years of filing bills and then it had no teeth,” Skidmore said. “And it should have been the easiest piece.”
Where Was The DEA and Everyone Else?
The DEA all but wrung its hands over Florida’s lethal inaction. The agency ticked off a devil’s brew of regulatory loopholes: Florida’s Health Department regulated health care professionals but not pain clinics. The state’s Agency for Health Care Administration regulated pain clinics that accepted insurance, but pill mills were most often on a cash-only basis. And the prescription monitoring database, mired in a vendor dispute, remained stalled.
In early 2011, when Gov. Rick Scott took office, just one drug — oxycodone — was tied to six fatal overdoses a day. Deaths tied to all drugs claimed 25 a day. In the handful of Appalachian states where traffickers were bringing back South Florida pills, it was worse.
Ohio’s death rate for oxycodone and similar opioids had doubled in 24 months, federal records show. Kentucky’s was up by more than 50 percent. And in West Virginia, home to hard-hit Huntington, death rates tied to pill mill drugs such as oxycodone and Opana had climbed by 341 percent.
The DEA formally pinpointed Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties as the nation’s single biggest hub for trafficking pills across state lines. Within weeks of being sworn in, Scott abolished Florida’s Office of Drug Control, eliminating the state drug czar position, announced plans to drive a final stake in the heart of the database and rebuffed Purdue Pharma’s renewed offer to help pay for it.
Scott, a tea party conservative, cited privacy concerns, expressed skepticism the monitoring program would work and raised the possibility taxpayers would be left with a $500,000-a-year bill to operate it.
Attorney General Pam Bondi had also ridden the tea party wave to her position. She shared many of Scott’s conservative convictions. Unlike Scott, the former prosecutor relentlessly lobbied to keep the database alive. Florida’s failure to adopt the drug monitoring database was so out of step with the rest of the country that it began spawning conspiracy theories on both sides of the law.
Everyone knew prescription monitoring was going to kill the pill smuggling business, said a corrupt Florida Highway Patrol trooper as he drove a load of pills out of Florida, according to a federal lawsuit. Talking to the confidential informant in the seat next to him, the trooper speculated someone in Tallahassee must have a piece of the action, “because (Scott) was so adamant about not putting that system in place. Right?”
In Greenup, an infuriated Cooper told a reporter, “In my opinion, (Scott’s) getting money from somewhere. He has to be.” A few days later, recalled Cooper, “A lieutenant with the state police I’d been talking to down there called me, said, ‘Man, just a head’s up: I wouldn’t come to Florida.’” In states on the receiving end of the Florida pill pipeline and among federal officials, Scott’s resistance triggered outrage.
In Kentucky, where as much as 60 percent of the illicit oxycodone in that state flowed from Florida, Lt. Gov. Daniel Mongiardo proposed erecting billboards at the Florida line: “Welcome to the Oxy Tourism Capital of the World.”
U.S. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, also from Kentucky, twice wrote Scott. “Canceling Florida’s prescription drug monitoring program is equal to firing firefighters while your house is ablaze,” he wrote.
Gil Kerlikowske, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, asked to meet with Scott. So did DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart.
Three U.S. senators — New York’s Chuck Schumer, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Rhode Island’s Sheldon Whitehouse — joined Florida’s Bill Nelson in pointing out that the pills weren’t just a Florida problem: There were “serious ramifications for the rest of the country,” wrote Nelson of Scott’s reluctance to crack down. This is a perfect example of how political rhetoric, in-fighting and contrived agendas prevented an early stop to the emerging opioid crisis many years ago.
WHY DIDN’T THE DEA, DRUG DISTRIBUTORS AND PHARMACIES TAKE NOTICE BEFORE THE OPIOID CRISIS SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY LIKE WILDFIRE? WAS IT BECAUSE OF THE BILLIONS IN PROFITS, QUARTERLY BONUSES AND DIVIDENDS? STOCK OPTIONS CASHED IN BY BOARDROOMS AT EVERY OPIOID BIG PHARMA COMPANY? STAY TUNED FOR HOW “PROFITS BEFORE PATIENTS” BECAME THE NORM
(article excerpts and quotes have been taken from publicly available media sources and court records)",['Privacy concerns and skepticism about its effectiveness.'],6048,multifieldqa_en,en,,e84f6371f23c95f766248ac4e52b781f325f52f09c6eb9ae," Purdue and the Sacklers chose to ignore Florida, because apparently nobody there sued them or complained. 90 of 100 of the nation’s top 100 oxy-buying doctors in 2010, were in Florida. Pharmacies and distributors are at fault as well, pharmacies ordered jaw-dropping numbers of pills from opioid drug distributors. There were 53 million oxycodone prescriptions filled in 2013 by US pharmacies, according to NIDA. This translates to approximately one bottle of this addictive drug for every 6 people in the country. How was this not noticed by those responsible for monitoring for narcotics prescribing in the United States? The answer is: “The Oxy Express Explained’ The Oxy Express is a book that explains how Oxycontin was created and managed in the Purdue Pharma boardroom. It is published by Simon & Schuster, a division of Simon and Schuster. The book is called “Oxycontin: The Story Behind The Oxycontin Cartridges” and is published in hardback and e-book form by Simon&Schuster, priced $39.99. For more information on the book, visit: www.simonandschuster.com. Florida was the oxycodone drug dealer of choice for drug users and dealers in the Great Lakes, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions as well as the Southeast. For 10 years, key lawmakers and agency heads repeatedly looked the other way as crooked doctors and bogus clinics flooded almost half the nation with the highly addictive drug. A Boston crime boss trafficked pills from Massachusetts into New York, Rhode Island and South Carolina. A high-school wrestling team in New Port Richey, Tennessee, mailed 17,000 pills to Glen Fork, W.Va., a child in the tiny town. A boardroom Contrived Opioid Epidemic was created by the “Opioid Big Pharma Industry” to support massive over-prescribing of opioids across the country to everyone who walked in to a medical treatment facility. The “Oxy Express’s” “parking lot” states in Appalachia, where dealers and addicts with a tank of gas or a cheap plane ticket traveled to Palm Beach and Broward, Florida, to get OxyContin and pills with OxyContin’S active ingredient, Oxycodone. The West Virginia vans were part of a nationwide caravan heading to South Florida. Of the nation’s top 100 oxycodone-buying doctors, 90 were in Florida. Oxycodone 30-milligram tablets were favored by addicts. In 2009 and 2010, roughly four of every 10 of those pills were sold in Florida, the DEA says. A single Walgreens pharmacy in the Central Florida townOviedo bought 169,700 doses of oxycod one in 30 days. A Florida man was arrested driving his Bentley Continental in Miami in 2011. He was one of two traffickers overseeing a crew smuggling South Florida oxycodones to sell in Salt Lake City, Seattle and Denver as well as Oregon, Nevada, Texas and even Alaska. The DEA says Florida is the ‘Wild West of Oxycodon Prescribing’ and that the state is responsible for more than 60 percent of its drug sales. The state is also responsible for about 20 percent of the illicit oxycodon in the entire state. The federal government says the state has the highest rate of prescription drug abuse in the U.S. and the second-highest rate of drug abuse among adults aged 18-24. CEO Dennis Smith worried that the Florida-bound oxycodone was getting in the wrong hands. Masters executives figured the pharmacies would keep an eye out for excessive prescriptions written by pill mill doctors. But not all pharmacies were worrying about doctors at pain clinics. Many pharmacies were courting the pill mills prescribers. Hundreds of thousands of oxycodones were sent from Ohio distributors to Florida pharmacies. Unknown thousands of pills headed right back up to Ohio and West Virginia.. Doctors and pharmacies from Florida were complicit with David L. Kidd’s ring in fueling the Ohio opioid epidemic, wrote the U.S. attorney for West Virginia after 2011. The DEA later said neither Masters nor Superior had so much as Googled the background of pain clinic doctors writing those prescriptions. The company stopped selling to pain clinics in 2009. But the company continued to shovel millions of Oxycodone pills to Florida pharmacy. The pharmacy owner expressed frustration that drug distributors were limiting the amount of narcotics they would sell to his now-closed pharmacy. A Masters inspector found cars from Tennessee and Kentucky in the parking lot and young men leaving the pharmacy carrying large trash bags. In 2010, Florida received applications to open 1,026 more pain clinics. An estimated 60 percent of Dr. Lynn Averill's patients were from out of state. Florida Gov. Jeb Bush supported a prescription drug monitoring program that would track prescriptions written for controlled substances, such as oxycodone. It was being described as a “silver bullet” to curb the flow of pain pills into the Ohio Valley from Florida. But it came with a catch: There was no way to know whether a doctor was overprescribing, and where a pill mill was operating, and whether a prescription database would be used to pinpoint the source of the problem. It didn’t matter, Ohio, Delaware, North Carolina, Connecticut acted as well, but other state’s efforts didn't matter either, Florida continued ignoring the pill mills and rogue doctors feeding the nation”s oxycodones habit, the pills flowed. It's time for Florida to take action, and it's time to take steps to prevent future deaths from prescription painkillers, the DEA says. It is time for the U.S. to take a stronger stance against prescription painkiller abuse. Marco Rubio killed the prescription drug monitoring bill in 2002. The bill could have curbed a national opioid epidemic when it was just an emerging problem. Rubio was the first, not the last, in a line of state legislative leaders who would refuse to seriously consider the bill. Rubio didn’t kill the 2002 bill out of opposition to prescription monitoring—it was politics “as usual” Yet nobody blamed Rubio for the resulting opioid crisis that seems to have started in his political backyard and flourished beyond belief.“And there was one person who was responsible,” said former state Sen. Burt, now an Ormond Beach insurance executive. “And it was Marco Rubio.” “When I found out he broke his word, it made the choice easy,’ Rubio said of Burt’s betrayal. � “I’m not going to back down now. I’ve got to do what I have to do.’ “ “ Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was a leader in the Florida House in 2002 when he blocked a vote on prescription monitoring. The 2004 deadline for greenlighting a monitoring system passed. So did Purdue’s million-dollar obligation to pay for it. “Not getting that bill through the Legislature resulted in Florida becoming the pill mill capital of the United States,” said Burt. Between 2002, the year Rubio killed the database that could have identified doctor-shoppers, more than 20,800 Floridians died after taking prescription opioids, including OxyContin, annual Florida Medical Examiners’ reports show. Before her office was raided by law enforcement in December 2001, Asuncion M. Luya was one of the most prolific prescisters of OxyContin in the state. Between 1999 and 2001, Medicaid shelled out $935,634 for prescriptions for OxyContin. That was just OxyContin written by Luya. The state’S poorest and most sickest citizens and their families were paying for the Medicaid program for the OxyContin prescriptions. The program was funded by the state”s taxpayer-financed health program for sickest and poorest citizens. The cost of the program was $934,635, or about $1.2 million a year. The number of prescriptions written by OxyContin was just over 1 million. Medicaid paid for more than $300,000 to fill Dr. James Graves’ OxyContin prescriptions. One man used his 7-year-old son’s Medicaid number to doctor-shop for OxyContin. Most people on Florida Medicaid getting oxycodone prescriptions in 2011 were getting an average of nine months worth of pills. Florida wasn’t in any hurry to stop doctors linked to pill mills. The state did not act against Dr. Selwyn Carrington for signing his name to hundreds of prescriptions for Medicaid patients in just two years. A doctor who billed Medicaid $3.7 million for Oxycontin pills was charged with paying Medicaid patients $150 each to use their IDs. A state representative in a district straddling Palm Beach and Broward counties had more pain in 2002 than it had in 2007. ”OxyContin and prescription opioids, had evolved into a full-blown crisis in the ensuing seven years.’ ‘Oxycontin and painkillers had evolved from a serious problem in 2002 to a crisis in 2007,’ said former state representative Kelly Skidmore.

The billboards read: ‘Welcome to Florida. Oxy Oxy Tou.’ ““By God, if we had had seven dolphins a day dying and washing up on Florida beaches, we would have been appropriating money and solving it.” U.S. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, also from Kentucky, twice wrote Scott. “Canceling Florida’s prescription drug monitoring program is equal to firing firefighters while your house is ablaze,” he wrote.Gil Kerlikowske, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, asked to meet with Scott.

In which electorate was Simon English elected to the New Zealand Parliament?,"Sir Simon William English  (born 30 December 1961) is a New Zealand former National Party politician who served as the 39th prime minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017. He had previously served as the 17th deputy prime minister of New Zealand and minister of finance from 2008 to 2016 under John Key and the Fifth National Government.

A farmer and public servant before entering politics, English was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in  as the National Party's candidate in the Wallace electorate. He was elevated to Cabinet in 1996 and in 1999 was made minister of finance, although he served for less than a year due to his party's loss at the 1999 general election. In October 2001, English replaced Jenny Shipley as the leader of the National Party (and consequently as Leader of the Opposition). He led the party to its worst defeat at the 2002 general election, and as a consequence, in October 2003 he was replaced as leader by Don Brash.

In November 2006, after Brash's resignation, English became deputy leader under John Key. After National's victory at the 2008 general election, he became deputy prime minister and was also made minister of finance for the second time. Under English's direction New Zealand's economy maintained steady growth during National's three terms of government. He became a list-only MP after stepping down as an electorate MP at the 2014 general election.

John Key resigned as leader of the National Party and prime minister in December 2016. English won the resulting leadership election unopposed and was sworn in as prime minister on 12 December 2016. His tenure was only ten months, and included a three-month election campaign. In the 2017 general election, National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. The parties holding the balance of power declined to support the existing government, and English was subsequently replaced as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern, leader of the Labour Party. English initially continued on as Leader of the Opposition, but resigned as leader of the National Party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later.

Early life
English was born on 30 December 1961 at Lumsden Maternity Centre in Lumsden. He is the eleventh of twelve children of Mervyn English and Norah (née O'Brien) English. His parents purchased Rosedale, a mixed sheep and cropping farm in Dipton, Southland from Mervyn's uncle, Vincent English, a bachelor, in 1944. English was born in the maternity unit at Lumsden.

English attended St Thomas's School in Winton, then boarded at St. Patrick's College in Upper Hutt, where he became head boy. He played in the first XV of the school's rugby team. English went on to study commerce at the University of Otago, where he was a resident at Selwyn College, and then completed an honours degree in English literature at Victoria University of Wellington.

After finishing his studies, English returned to Dipton and farmed for a few years. From 1987 to 1989, he worked in Wellington as a policy analyst for the New Zealand Treasury, at a time when the free market policies favoured by Labour's finance minister Roger Douglas (known collectively as ""Rogernomics"") were being implemented.

English joined the National Party in 1980, while at Victoria University. He served for a period as chairman of the Southland branch of the Young Nationals, and became a member of the Wallace electorate committee. After moving to Wellington, he served for periods on the Island Bay and Miramar electorate committees, respectively.

Fourth National Government (1990–1999)

At the 1990 general election, English stood as the National candidate in Wallace, replacing the retiring Derek Angus, and was elected with a large majority. He would hold this seat, renamed Clutha-Southland in 1996, until 2014. He and three other newly elected National MPs (Tony Ryall, Nick Smith, and Roger Sowry) were soon identified as rising stars in New Zealand politics, and at various points were dubbed the ""brat pack"", the ""gang of four"", and the ""young Turks"". In his first term in parliament, English chaired a select committee into social services. He was made a parliamentary under-secretary in 1993, serving under the Minister of Health.

First period in cabinet (1996–1999)
In early 1996, English was elevated to cabinet by Prime Minister Jim Bolger, becoming the Minister for Crown Health Enterprises and Associate Minister of Education (to Wyatt Creech). He was 34 at the time, becoming the cabinet's youngest member. After the 1996 general election, the National Party was forced into a coalition with New Zealand First to retain government. In the resulting cabinet reshuffle, English emerged as Minister of Health. However, as a condition of the coalition agreement, NZ First's Neil Kirton (a first-term MP) was made Associate Minister of Health, effectively becoming English's deputy. This arrangement was described in the press as a ""shotgun marriage"", and there were frequent differences of opinion between the two ministers. After their relationship became unworkable, Kirton was sacked from the role in August 1997, with the agreement of NZ First leader Winston Peters.

As Minister of Health, English was responsible for continuing the reforms to the public health system that National had begun after the 1990 general election. The reforms were unpopular, and health was perceived as one of the government's weaknesses, with the health portfolio consequently being viewed as a challenge. English believed that the unpopularity of the reforms was in part due to a failure in messaging, and encouraged his National colleagues to avoid bureaucratic and money-focused language (such as references to ""balance sheets"" and ""user charges"") and instead talk about the improvements to services the government's reforms would bring. He also rejected the idea that public hospitals could be run as commercial enterprises, a view which some of his colleagues had previously promoted.

By early 1997, as dissatisfaction with Bolger's leadership began to grow, English was being touted as a potential successor, along with Jenny Shipley and Doug Graham. His age (35) was viewed as the main impediment to a successful leadership run. National's leadership troubles were resolved in December 1997, when Bolger resigned and Shipley was elected to the leadership unopposed. English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet.

English was promoted to Minister of Finance in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch's transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors (Roger Douglas's ""Rogernomics"" and Ruth Richardson's ""Ruthanasia"") had focused on ""fruitless, theoretical debates"" when ""people just want to see problems solved"".

Opposition (1999–2008)

After the National Party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party, English continued on in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of Wyatt Creech, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent.

Leader of the Opposition
In October 2001, after months of speculation, Jenny Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English was elected as her replacement unopposed (with Roger Sowry as his deputy), and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to The Southland Times ""there was almost an element of 'aw, shucks, I'll do it then' about Mr English's ascension"".

Aged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. However, English failed to improve the party's performance. In the 2002 election, National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote. English described it as ""the worst day of my political life"". Both party insiders and the general public were split as to how much to blame him for the loss, but most of the party believed that English would be able to rebuild National's support.

By late 2003, however, National's performance in opinion polls remained poor. The party had briefly increased its popularity in the year following the election, but by October its support had fallen to levels only slightly better than what it achieved in the last ballot. English also appeared in a boxing match for a charity against entertainer Ted Clarke. This did not boost his polling or that of the National party either, with suggestions that it devalued his image as a serious politician. Don Brash, former governor of the Reserve Bank and a relative newcomer to politics, began to build up support to replace English. On 28 October, Brash gained sufficient backing in Caucus to defeat English in a leadership contest.

Shadow cabinet roles and deputy leader
On 2 November 2003, when Brash changed responsibilities for certain MPs, English became National's spokesman for education, ranked at fifth place in the party's parliamentary hierarchy. He remained in parliament after the 2005 election. In his new shadow education portfolio, English performed strongly, and remained a party favourite despite his election defeat as leader in 2002, eventually being returned to the finance portfolio in August 2004 as deputy spokesman (while still retaining responsibility for education).

In November 2006, Brash resigned as leader. English was considered as a potential replacement leader (running against John Key) or deputy leader (against incumbent Gerry Brownlee) in the ensuing leadership election. However, a contest was avoided when the MPs agreed a Key/English ticket would run unopposed in a display of party unity. English took over the deputy leadership and the finance portfolio in the Key shadow cabinet.

Fifth National Government (2008–2017)

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance (2008–2016)

At the 2008 election, English was re-elected by his electorate, winning by a margin of about 15,500 votes. He became Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Finance in the fifth National Government, being sworn into office on 19 November 2008 and continued to serve in those roles until becoming Prime Minister on 12 December 2014. He was also made Minister of Infrastructure in National's first term of government and Minister responsible for Housing New Zealand Corporation and minister responsible for the New Zealand flag consideration process in its third.

He was comfortably re-elected in Clutha-Southland in the 2011 election but opted to run as a party-list candidate in 2014. 

The pairing of John Key as leader of the National Party and English as his deputy has been compared to that of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating (in Australia) and Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (in the UK).

English acceded to the role of Finance Minister in the continuing wake of the financial crisis. In response to New Zealand's rising debt, English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority. His first budget outlined three focuses in New Zealand's financial recovery: ""improving the business environment and removing roadblocks to growth; investment in productive infrastructure; and improving the way government works"". One of his first acts was creating the National Infrastructure Unit, charged with formulating a plan for infrastructure projects and investments. He commissioned a government-wide spending review, with an aim to reducing government expenditure—with the exceptions of a two-year stimulus package and long-term increases on infrastructure spending.

In April 2011, the Opposition criticised English for suggesting that New Zealand businesses could use New Zealand's low wages to help it compete with Australia. The National Government campaigned for re-election in 2011 on its economic record. The Government boasted growth for five consecutive quarters up to mid-2010, totalling 1.6% of real GDP.

Strong growth resulted in a surplus of $473 million for the 2015/16 financial year, projected to rise to $8.5 billion by 2020/21. In his 2016 Economic and Fiscal Update address, English stated that reducing debt and tackling the costs of the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake were higher priorities than reducing rates of tax.

Allowances issue
In 2009, the media, including TVNZ and TV3 revealed that English was receiving about NZ$900 a week as part of a living allowance for ministers, to live in his own NZ$1.2 million Wellington home. At the time, English also received $276,200 in his annual salary as Deputy Prime Minister. It was also revealed other ministers with homes in the capital city were also claiming accommodation allowances. On 3 August 2009, Prime Minister John Key started a review of the housing allowances claimed by cabinet ministers. English subsequently paid back $12,000 and only claimed about $24,000 a year in living allowances. The Auditor-General's office said in September 2009 that they were making ""preliminary enquiries"" into parliamentary housing expenses in response to a letter of complaint from Progressive party leader Jim Anderton. Two days later English stated that he would no longer take up any housing allowance and had paid back all the allowance he had received since the November 2008 election.

Prime Minister (2016–2017)

John Key resigned on 12 December, and endorsed English as his successor in the resulting leadership election. Following the drop-out of both Judith Collins and Jonathan Coleman from the leadership election, English was sworn in as the 39th Prime Minister of New Zealand on 12 December 2016.

English appointed his first cabinet on 18 December. In a reshuffle, he appointed Steven Joyce to succeed him as Finance Minister, while most ministerial portfolios remained the same.

In February 2017, English did not attend Waitangi Day commemorations at the historic treaty grounds, reportedly in response to the Ngāpuhi iwi's decision to stop the Prime Minister from speaking at the marae. Ngāpuhi have protested the Government's negotiation of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), which the iwi believe infringes upon Māori sovereignty, and thus does not adhere to the Treaty of Waitangi. English had been invited to attend in an official capacity; his non-attendance was criticised by a Ngāpuhi elder and Opposition leader Andrew Little.

In his first overseas trip as Prime Minister, English travelled to Europe to discuss trade ties, including a prospective New Zealand–European Union free trade agreement. He first travelled to London on 13 January 2017 to meet British Prime Minister Theresa May. Discussing trade relations, English said the two nations were ""natural partners"" and would ""continue to forge ties"" after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. He also arranged to meet with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  In a meeting with Merkel, English received crucial backing from Germany for a trade deal with the EU. On 16 January, English stated that his government would continue to promote TPPA, despite the United States' decision to withdraw from the agreement. He explained that Southeast Asian countries would now be treated as a priority in negotiations—he also asserted that the United States was ceding influence to China by its rejection of the trade pact.

At a press conference at the Beehive on 1 February 2017, English announced that the 2017 general election would be held on 23 September. The Prime Minister later confirmed that his party would approach ACT, United Future and the Māori Party if confidence and supply agreements were required to form a government following the election. In his second cabinet reshuffle on 24 April, English appointed Gerry Brownlee as his new Foreign Affairs Minister; he also promoted Nikki Kaye to the portfolio of Education Minister, and moved Mark Mitchell into the cabinet to become Defence Minister. The reshuffle was perceived as an election preparation.

On 13 February 2017, English welcomed Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to Wellington. The two leaders reaffirmed their shared trade agenda, and discussed changes to the Australian citizenship pathway which will affect permanent residents originating from New Zealand.

On 19 June, it was reported that Todd Barclay, who succeeded English as MP for Clutha-Southland, had clandestinely recorded one of his employee's conversations the previous year, and that John Key's leaders' budget was used to pay a confidential settlement after the employee resigned. English admitted that he had been aware of the illegal recording and the settlement, and thus implicated in the scandal.

During the 2017 National campaign launch, English introduced a $379 million social investment package including digital learning academies for high school students, more resources for mathematics, and boosting support for teaching second languages in schools, and maintaining National Standards in the school curriculum. Prime Minister English also sought to defend National's financial management and economic track record and claimed that the opposition Labour Party would raise taxes. Early opinion polling had forecast a poor showing in the election for the Labour Party, but in early August 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern took over as Labour leader and seemingly energised younger voters.

At the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House Representatives. However, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party's support partners, the Māori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English stated that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. Following talks with the two largest parties, New Zealand First entered a coalition arrangement with the Labour Party. English was succeeded as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October.

Opposition (2017–2018)

Leader of the Opposition
English was re-elected as National Party leader on 24 October 2017. At the time of his re-election, English announced his intention to stay on as leader until the next general election. On 13 February 2018, however, he stood down as National Party leader due to personal reasons, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. He also retired from Parliament. English's resignation followed weeks of speculation that he would step aside for a new leader. On 27 February, he was succeeded as party leader by Simon Bridges as the result of the leadership election held that day.

Post-premiership 
In 2018, English joined the board of Australian conglomerate, Wesfarmers. English serves in Chairmanships of Mount Cook Alpine Salmon, Impact Lab Ltd and Manawanui Support Ltd. He is also a director of The Instillery, Centre for Independent Studies and The Todd Corporation Limited, and is a member of the Impact Advisory Group of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets.

Political and social views

English is regarded as more socially conservative than his predecessor, John Key. He has stated his opposition to voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, same-sex civil unions, and the decriminalisation of prostitution. As Prime Minister he opposed any ""liberalisation"" of abortion law.

In 2004, English voted against a bill to establish civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. In 2005, he voted for the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill, which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. English voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill that legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand. However, in December 2016 he stated, ""I'd probably vote differently now on the gay marriage issue. I don't think that gay marriage is a threat to anyone else's marriage"".

In 2009, English voted against the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill, a bill aimed at amending the Misuse of Drugs Act so that cannabis could be used for medical purposes.

Personal life 
English met his future wife, Mary Scanlon, at university. She was studying medicine at the time, and became a general practitioner. Both her parents were immigrants, her father being Samoan and her mother Italian, born on the island of Stromboli. They have six children: a daughter and five sons.

English is a practising Roman Catholic, but has stated that he considers his religious beliefs personal and thus separate from politics.

In June 2002, English took part in TV3's Fight For Life, a celebrity boxing fundraiser to raise money for the Yellow Ribbon anti-youth-suicide campaign, influenced by the death of a teenage nephew in 1997. He lost a split decision to former university colleague Ted Clarke.

Honours
In the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours, English was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services of over 27 years to the State.

He was the 39th prime minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017. He had previously served as the 17th deputy prime minister and minister of finance from 2008 to 2016 under John Key and the Fifth National Government. English was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in 1996 as the National Party's candidate in the Wallace electorate. He led the party to its worst defeat at the 2002 general election, and as a consequence was replaced as leader by Don Brash in 2003. He became a list-only MP after stepping down as an electorate MP at the 2014 general election. In the 2017 election, National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. English resigned as leader of the National party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later. He is the eleventh of twelve children of Mervyn English and Norah O'Brien English. English is a graduate of Victoria University of Wellington and St Patrick's College in Upper Hutt. English was made a parliamentary under-secretary in 1993. In early 1996, he was elevated to cabinet by Prime Minister Jim Bolger. He was the cabinet's youngest member at the time, aged 34. In 1997, as dissatisfaction with Bolger's leadership began to grow, English was touted as a potential successor, along with Jenny Shipley and Doug Graham. His age (35) was viewed as the main impediment to a successful leadership run. English was promoted to Minister of Finance in January 1999, a position which was subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. In October 2001, after months of speculation, Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party and English was elected as her replacement unopposed. He remained in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance until the party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party. In February 2001 he was elected deputy leader, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent. In 2008, he became Leader of the Opposition, and served until the end of his term in office in 2009. English was the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. English was re-elected by his electorate, winning by a margin of about 15,500 votes. He became Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Finance in the fifth National Government, being sworn into office on 19 November 2008. He continued to serve in those roles until becoming Prime Minister on 12 December 2014. English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority in response to New Zealand's rising debt. He was comfortably re- elected in Clutha-Southland in the 2011 election but opted to run as a party-list candidate in 2014. His first budget outlined three focuses: ""improving the business environment and removing roadblocks to growth; investment in productive infrastructure; and improving the way government works"" English was sworn in as the 39th Prime Minister of New Zealand on 12 December 2016.

What was the population of McPherson County according to the 2020 census?,"McPherson County (standard abbreviation: MP) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas.  As of the 2020 census, the county population was 30,223. The largest city and county seat is McPherson. The county is named for Civil War General James B. McPherson.

History

Early history

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.

In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1848, after the Mexican–American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Spain brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.

19th century

From the 1820s to 1870s, the Santa Fe Trail passed through, what is now McPherson County. The trail entered the county, east of Canton, then south of Galva, then north of Inman, and west towards Lyons. In 1855, Charles O. Fuller established a ranch adjacent to the Running Turkey Creek Crossing about two miles south and one mile east of Galva. Fuller's Ranch provided accommodations for travelers on the Santa Fe Trail and was probably the first white settlement in McPherson County.

Peketon County was established in 1860, by the passage of a bill by S. N. Wood:  An act to establish Peketon County. Section 1. - That all that territory west of the sixth principal meridian and south of Township 16, in Kansas Territory, be and the same is hereby erected into a county, to be known by the name of Peketon County. On February 17, 1865, Peketon County was abolished, and McPherson County was made a part of Marion County, which extended from the west line of Chase County to the present western boundary of Kansas.

In 1868, Solomon Stephens and L. N. Holmberg were appointed Justices of the Peace—the first officers in what is now McPherson County. The next year (1869) occurred the first election for the township, now the county of McPherson. McPherson was regularly organized as a county in the spring of 1870, a mass meeting being held at Sweadal. Sweadal, the county seat thus selected, was located about one mile and a half southwest of the present site of Lindsborg. In September, however, the County Commissioners resolved to meet at the latter place, McPherson which had already been located some two years.

In April, 1873, a petition was filed for the county seat re-location. It was signed by 483 voters, and a special election was accordingly ordered for June 10. Upon that day, McPherson received 605 votes, New Gottland 325, King City 3 and Lindsborg 1; McPherson's majority over all, 276. In May the McPherson Town Company had offered, as an inducement for the location of the county seat at this point, the free use of rooms for ten years, and the donation of two squares of land on the town site. The offer was accepted the next month, the County Commissioners selecting blocks 56 and 65. Thus the county seat was established at McPherson and has remained since.

As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion County and McPherson County chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company.  In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson, in 1880 it was extended to Lyons, in 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion, was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase, then connected with the original AT&SF main line at Ellinwood.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway extended its main line from Herington to Pratt.  This main line connected Herington, Ramona, Tampa, Durham, Waldeck, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Groveland, Inman, Medora, Hutchinson, Whiteside, Partridge, Arlington,  Langdon, Turon, Preston, Natrona, Pratt.  In 1888, this main line was extended to Liberal.  Later, this line was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and Santa Rosa, New Mexico, where it made a connection with the Southern Pacific from El Paso, Texas.  The Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway was absorbed by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway. This line is also called the ""Golden State Route"".

20th century
The National Old Trails Road, also known as the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, was established in 1912, and was routed through Windom, Conway, McPherson.

When did the 2017 general election be held?,"Sir Simon William English  (born 30 December 1961) is a New Zealand former National Party politician who served as the 39th prime minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017. He had previously served as the 17th deputy prime minister of New Zealand and minister of finance from 2008 to 2016 under John Key and the Fifth National Government.

A farmer and public servant before entering politics, English was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in  as the National Party's candidate in the Wallace electorate. He was elevated to Cabinet in 1996 and in 1999 was made minister of finance, although he served for less than a year due to his party's loss at the 1999 general election. In October 2001, English replaced Jenny Shipley as the leader of the National Party (and consequently as Leader of the Opposition). He led the party to its worst defeat at the 2002 general election, and as a consequence, in October 2003 he was replaced as leader by Don Brash.

In November 2006, after Brash's resignation, English became deputy leader under John Key. After National's victory at the 2008 general election, he became deputy prime minister and was also made minister of finance for the second time. Under English's direction New Zealand's economy maintained steady growth during National's three terms of government. He became a list-only MP after stepping down as an electorate MP at the 2014 general election.

John Key resigned as leader of the National Party and prime minister in December 2016. English won the resulting leadership election unopposed and was sworn in as prime minister on 12 December 2016. His tenure was only ten months, and included a three-month election campaign. In the 2017 general election, National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. The parties holding the balance of power declined to support the existing government, and English was subsequently replaced as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern, leader of the Labour Party. English initially continued on as Leader of the Opposition, but resigned as leader of the National Party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later.

Early life
English was born on 30 December 1961 at Lumsden Maternity Centre in Lumsden. He is the eleventh of twelve children of Mervyn English and Norah (née O'Brien) English. His parents purchased Rosedale, a mixed sheep and cropping farm in Dipton, Southland from Mervyn's uncle, Vincent English, a bachelor, in 1944. English was born in the maternity unit at Lumsden.

English attended St Thomas's School in Winton, then boarded at St. Patrick's College in Upper Hutt, where he became head boy. He played in the first XV of the school's rugby team. English went on to study commerce at the University of Otago, where he was a resident at Selwyn College, and then completed an honours degree in English literature at Victoria University of Wellington.

After finishing his studies, English returned to Dipton and farmed for a few years. From 1987 to 1989, he worked in Wellington as a policy analyst for the New Zealand Treasury, at a time when the free market policies favoured by Labour's finance minister Roger Douglas (known collectively as ""Rogernomics"") were being implemented.

English joined the National Party in 1980, while at Victoria University. He served for a period as chairman of the Southland branch of the Young Nationals, and became a member of the Wallace electorate committee. After moving to Wellington, he served for periods on the Island Bay and Miramar electorate committees, respectively.

Fourth National Government (1990–1999)

At the 1990 general election, English stood as the National candidate in Wallace, replacing the retiring Derek Angus, and was elected with a large majority. He would hold this seat, renamed Clutha-Southland in 1996, until 2014. He and three other newly elected National MPs (Tony Ryall, Nick Smith, and Roger Sowry) were soon identified as rising stars in New Zealand politics, and at various points were dubbed the ""brat pack"", the ""gang of four"", and the ""young Turks"". In his first term in parliament, English chaired a select committee into social services. He was made a parliamentary under-secretary in 1993, serving under the Minister of Health.

First period in cabinet (1996–1999)
In early 1996, English was elevated to cabinet by Prime Minister Jim Bolger, becoming the Minister for Crown Health Enterprises and Associate Minister of Education (to Wyatt Creech). He was 34 at the time, becoming the cabinet's youngest member. After the 1996 general election, the National Party was forced into a coalition with New Zealand First to retain government. In the resulting cabinet reshuffle, English emerged as Minister of Health. However, as a condition of the coalition agreement, NZ First's Neil Kirton (a first-term MP) was made Associate Minister of Health, effectively becoming English's deputy. This arrangement was described in the press as a ""shotgun marriage"", and there were frequent differences of opinion between the two ministers. After their relationship became unworkable, Kirton was sacked from the role in August 1997, with the agreement of NZ First leader Winston Peters.

As Minister of Health, English was responsible for continuing the reforms to the public health system that National had begun after the 1990 general election. The reforms were unpopular, and health was perceived as one of the government's weaknesses, with the health portfolio consequently being viewed as a challenge. English believed that the unpopularity of the reforms was in part due to a failure in messaging, and encouraged his National colleagues to avoid bureaucratic and money-focused language (such as references to ""balance sheets"" and ""user charges"") and instead talk about the improvements to services the government's reforms would bring. He also rejected the idea that public hospitals could be run as commercial enterprises, a view which some of his colleagues had previously promoted.

By early 1997, as dissatisfaction with Bolger's leadership began to grow, English was being touted as a potential successor, along with Jenny Shipley and Doug Graham. His age (35) was viewed as the main impediment to a successful leadership run. National's leadership troubles were resolved in December 1997, when Bolger resigned and Shipley was elected to the leadership unopposed. English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet.

English was promoted to Minister of Finance in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch's transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors (Roger Douglas's ""Rogernomics"" and Ruth Richardson's ""Ruthanasia"") had focused on ""fruitless, theoretical debates"" when ""people just want to see problems solved"".

Opposition (1999–2008)

After the National Party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party, English continued on in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of Wyatt Creech, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent.

Leader of the Opposition
In October 2001, after months of speculation, Jenny Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English was elected as her replacement unopposed (with Roger Sowry as his deputy), and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to The Southland Times ""there was almost an element of 'aw, shucks, I'll do it then' about Mr English's ascension"".

Aged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. However, English failed to improve the party's performance. In the 2002 election, National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote. English described it as ""the worst day of my political life"". Both party insiders and the general public were split as to how much to blame him for the loss, but most of the party believed that English would be able to rebuild National's support.

By late 2003, however, National's performance in opinion polls remained poor. The party had briefly increased its popularity in the year following the election, but by October its support had fallen to levels only slightly better than what it achieved in the last ballot. English also appeared in a boxing match for a charity against entertainer Ted Clarke. This did not boost his polling or that of the National party either, with suggestions that it devalued his image as a serious politician. Don Brash, former governor of the Reserve Bank and a relative newcomer to politics, began to build up support to replace English. On 28 October, Brash gained sufficient backing in Caucus to defeat English in a leadership contest.

Shadow cabinet roles and deputy leader
On 2 November 2003, when Brash changed responsibilities for certain MPs, English became National's spokesman for education, ranked at fifth place in the party's parliamentary hierarchy. He remained in parliament after the 2005 election. In his new shadow education portfolio, English performed strongly, and remained a party favourite despite his election defeat as leader in 2002, eventually being returned to the finance portfolio in August 2004 as deputy spokesman (while still retaining responsibility for education).

In November 2006, Brash resigned as leader. English was considered as a potential replacement leader (running against John Key) or deputy leader (against incumbent Gerry Brownlee) in the ensuing leadership election. However, a contest was avoided when the MPs agreed a Key/English ticket would run unopposed in a display of party unity. English took over the deputy leadership and the finance portfolio in the Key shadow cabinet.

Fifth National Government (2008–2017)

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance (2008–2016)

At the 2008 election, English was re-elected by his electorate, winning by a margin of about 15,500 votes. He became Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Finance in the fifth National Government, being sworn into office on 19 November 2008 and continued to serve in those roles until becoming Prime Minister on 12 December 2014. He was also made Minister of Infrastructure in National's first term of government and Minister responsible for Housing New Zealand Corporation and minister responsible for the New Zealand flag consideration process in its third.

He was comfortably re-elected in Clutha-Southland in the 2011 election but opted to run as a party-list candidate in 2014. 

The pairing of John Key as leader of the National Party and English as his deputy has been compared to that of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating (in Australia) and Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (in the UK).

English acceded to the role of Finance Minister in the continuing wake of the financial crisis. In response to New Zealand's rising debt, English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority. His first budget outlined three focuses in New Zealand's financial recovery: ""improving the business environment and removing roadblocks to growth; investment in productive infrastructure; and improving the way government works"". One of his first acts was creating the National Infrastructure Unit, charged with formulating a plan for infrastructure projects and investments. He commissioned a government-wide spending review, with an aim to reducing government expenditure—with the exceptions of a two-year stimulus package and long-term increases on infrastructure spending.

In April 2011, the Opposition criticised English for suggesting that New Zealand businesses could use New Zealand's low wages to help it compete with Australia. The National Government campaigned for re-election in 2011 on its economic record. The Government boasted growth for five consecutive quarters up to mid-2010, totalling 1.6% of real GDP.

Strong growth resulted in a surplus of $473 million for the 2015/16 financial year, projected to rise to $8.5 billion by 2020/21. In his 2016 Economic and Fiscal Update address, English stated that reducing debt and tackling the costs of the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake were higher priorities than reducing rates of tax.

Allowances issue
In 2009, the media, including TVNZ and TV3 revealed that English was receiving about NZ$900 a week as part of a living allowance for ministers, to live in his own NZ$1.2 million Wellington home. At the time, English also received $276,200 in his annual salary as Deputy Prime Minister. It was also revealed other ministers with homes in the capital city were also claiming accommodation allowances. On 3 August 2009, Prime Minister John Key started a review of the housing allowances claimed by cabinet ministers. English subsequently paid back $12,000 and only claimed about $24,000 a year in living allowances. The Auditor-General's office said in September 2009 that they were making ""preliminary enquiries"" into parliamentary housing expenses in response to a letter of complaint from Progressive party leader Jim Anderton. Two days later English stated that he would no longer take up any housing allowance and had paid back all the allowance he had received since the November 2008 election.

Prime Minister (2016–2017)

John Key resigned on 12 December, and endorsed English as his successor in the resulting leadership election. Following the drop-out of both Judith Collins and Jonathan Coleman from the leadership election, English was sworn in as the 39th Prime Minister of New Zealand on 12 December 2016.

English appointed his first cabinet on 18 December. In a reshuffle, he appointed Steven Joyce to succeed him as Finance Minister, while most ministerial portfolios remained the same.

In February 2017, English did not attend Waitangi Day commemorations at the historic treaty grounds, reportedly in response to the Ngāpuhi iwi's decision to stop the Prime Minister from speaking at the marae. Ngāpuhi have protested the Government's negotiation of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), which the iwi believe infringes upon Māori sovereignty, and thus does not adhere to the Treaty of Waitangi. English had been invited to attend in an official capacity; his non-attendance was criticised by a Ngāpuhi elder and Opposition leader Andrew Little.

In his first overseas trip as Prime Minister, English travelled to Europe to discuss trade ties, including a prospective New Zealand–European Union free trade agreement. He first travelled to London on 13 January 2017 to meet British Prime Minister Theresa May. Discussing trade relations, English said the two nations were ""natural partners"" and would ""continue to forge ties"" after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. He also arranged to meet with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  In a meeting with Merkel, English received crucial backing from Germany for a trade deal with the EU. On 16 January, English stated that his government would continue to promote TPPA, despite the United States' decision to withdraw from the agreement. He explained that Southeast Asian countries would now be treated as a priority in negotiations—he also asserted that the United States was ceding influence to China by its rejection of the trade pact.

At a press conference at the Beehive on 1 February 2017, English announced that the 2017 general election would be held on 23 September. The Prime Minister later confirmed that his party would approach ACT, United Future and the Māori Party if confidence and supply agreements were required to form a government following the election. In his second cabinet reshuffle on 24 April, English appointed Gerry Brownlee as his new Foreign Affairs Minister; he also promoted Nikki Kaye to the portfolio of Education Minister, and moved Mark Mitchell into the cabinet to become Defence Minister. The reshuffle was perceived as an election preparation.

On 13 February 2017, English welcomed Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to Wellington. The two leaders reaffirmed their shared trade agenda, and discussed changes to the Australian citizenship pathway which will affect permanent residents originating from New Zealand.

On 19 June, it was reported that Todd Barclay, who succeeded English as MP for Clutha-Southland, had clandestinely recorded one of his employee's conversations the previous year, and that John Key's leaders' budget was used to pay a confidential settlement after the employee resigned. English admitted that he had been aware of the illegal recording and the settlement, and thus implicated in the scandal.

During the 2017 National campaign launch, English introduced a $379 million social investment package including digital learning academies for high school students, more resources for mathematics, and boosting support for teaching second languages in schools, and maintaining National Standards in the school curriculum. Prime Minister English also sought to defend National's financial management and economic track record and claimed that the opposition Labour Party would raise taxes. Early opinion polling had forecast a poor showing in the election for the Labour Party, but in early August 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern took over as Labour leader and seemingly energised younger voters.

At the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House Representatives. However, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party's support partners, the Māori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English stated that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. Following talks with the two largest parties, New Zealand First entered a coalition arrangement with the Labour Party. English was succeeded as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October.

Opposition (2017–2018)

Leader of the Opposition
English was re-elected as National Party leader on 24 October 2017. At the time of his re-election, English announced his intention to stay on as leader until the next general election. On 13 February 2018, however, he stood down as National Party leader due to personal reasons, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. He also retired from Parliament. English's resignation followed weeks of speculation that he would step aside for a new leader. On 27 February, he was succeeded as party leader by Simon Bridges as the result of the leadership election held that day.

Post-premiership 
In 2018, English joined the board of Australian conglomerate, Wesfarmers. English serves in Chairmanships of Mount Cook Alpine Salmon, Impact Lab Ltd and Manawanui Support Ltd. He is also a director of The Instillery, Centre for Independent Studies and The Todd Corporation Limited, and is a member of the Impact Advisory Group of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets.

Political and social views

English is regarded as more socially conservative than his predecessor, John Key. He has stated his opposition to voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, same-sex civil unions, and the decriminalisation of prostitution. As Prime Minister he opposed any ""liberalisation"" of abortion law.

In 2004, English voted against a bill to establish civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. In 2005, he voted for the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill, which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. English voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill that legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand. However, in December 2016 he stated, ""I'd probably vote differently now on the gay marriage issue. I don't think that gay marriage is a threat to anyone else's marriage"".

In 2009, English voted against the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill, a bill aimed at amending the Misuse of Drugs Act so that cannabis could be used for medical purposes.

Personal life 
English met his future wife, Mary Scanlon, at university. She was studying medicine at the time, and became a general practitioner. Both her parents were immigrants, her father being Samoan and her mother Italian, born on the island of Stromboli. They have six children: a daughter and five sons.

English is a practising Roman Catholic, but has stated that he considers his religious beliefs personal and thus separate from politics.

In June 2002, English took part in TV3's Fight For Life, a celebrity boxing fundraiser to raise money for the Yellow Ribbon anti-youth-suicide campaign, influenced by the death of a teenage nephew in 1997. He lost a split decision to former university colleague Ted Clarke.

Honours
In the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours, English was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services of over 27 years to the State.",['23 September.'],3422,multifieldqa_en,en,,94ccf4d54b36e7e9d4aa594a7bc426528630a5b8aff296a4," Sir Simon William English (born 30 December 1961) is a New Zealand former National Party politician. He was the 39th prime minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017. He had previously served as the 17th deputy prime minister and minister of finance from 2008 to 2016 under John Key and the Fifth National Government. English was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in 1996 as the National Party's candidate in the Wallace electorate. He led the party to its worst defeat at the 2002 general election, and as a consequence was replaced as leader by Don Brash in 2003. He became a list-only MP after stepping down as an electorate MP at the 2014 general election. In the 2017 election, National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. English resigned as leader of the National party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later. He is the eleventh of twelve children of Mervyn English and Norah O'Brien English. English is a graduate of Victoria University of Wellington and St Patrick's College in Upper Hutt. English was made a parliamentary under-secretary in 1993. In early 1996, he was elevated to cabinet by Prime Minister Jim Bolger. He was the cabinet's youngest member at the time, aged 34. In 1997, as dissatisfaction with Bolger's leadership began to grow, English was touted as a potential successor, along with Jenny Shipley and Doug Graham. His age (35) was viewed as the main impediment to a successful leadership run. English was promoted to Minister of Finance in January 1999, a position which was subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. In October 2001, after months of speculation, Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party and English was elected as her replacement unopposed. He remained in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance until the party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party. In February 2001 he was elected deputy leader, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent. In 2008, he became Leader of the Opposition, and served until the end of his term in office in 2009. English was the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. English was re-elected by his electorate, winning by a margin of about 15,500 votes. He became Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Finance in the fifth National Government, being sworn into office on 19 November 2008. He continued to serve in those roles until becoming Prime Minister on 12 December 2014. English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority in response to New Zealand's rising debt. He was comfortably re- elected in Clutha-Southland in the 2011 election but opted to run as a party-list candidate in 2014. His first budget outlined three focuses: ""improving the business environment and removing roadblocks to growth; investment in productive infrastructure; and improving the way government works"" English was sworn in as the 39th Prime Minister of New Zealand on 12 December 2016. In a reshuffle, he appointed Steven Joyce to succeed him as Finance Minister, while most ministerial portfolios remained the same. In his first overseas trip as Prime Minister, English travelled to Europe to discuss trade ties, including a prospective New Zealand–European Union free trade agreement. In February 2017, English did not attend Waitangi Day commemorations at the historic treaty grounds, reportedly in response to the Ngāpuhi iwi's decision to stop the Prime Minister from speaking at the marae. English said the two nations were ""natural partners"" and would ""continue to forge ties"" after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. In April 2011, the Opposition criticised English for suggesting that New Zealand businesses could use New Zealand's low wages to help it compete with Australia. The National Government campaigned for re-election in 2011 on its economic record. The Government boasted growth for five consecutive quarters up to mid-2010, totalling 1.6% of real GDP, projected to rise to $8.5 billion by 2020/21. English was re-elected as National Party leader on 24 October 2017. At the time of his re-election, English announced his intention to stay on as leader until the next general election. On 13 February 2018, however, he stood down as National party leader due to personal reasons. He was succeeded as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October. English is regarded as more socially conservative than his predecessor, John Key. He has stated his opposition to voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, same-sex civil unions, and the decriminalisation of prostitution. As Prime Minister he opposed any ""liberalisation"" of abortion law. In 2004, English voted against a bill to est in 2004, which would have legalised abortion in New Zealand. He is a director of Mount Cook Alpine Salmon, Impact Lab Ltd and Manawanui Support Ltd. He also serves in Chairmanships of The Instillery, Centre for Independent Studies and The Todd Corporation Limited. English joined the board of Australian conglomerate, Wesfarmers in 2018. In 2005, English voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill. In December 2016, he said he would vote for same-sex marriage. English is a practising Roman Catholic. He has been knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to New Zealand. He is married to Mary Scanlon, who was born on the island of Stromboli. The couple have six children, including a son and daughter."
What hedge fund's collapse in 1998 highlighted the need for regulation of derivatives?,"Brooksley Elizabeth Born (born August 27, 1940) is an American attorney and former public official who, from August 26, 1996, to June 1, 1999, was chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the federal agency which oversees the U.S. futures and commodity options markets. During her tenure on the CFTC, Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of off-exchange markets for derivatives, in addition to its role with respect to exchange-traded derivatives, but her warnings were ignored or dismissed, and her calls for reform resisted by other regulators.<ref name=""nytimes"">Goodman, Peter S. The Reckoning - Taking Hard New Look at a Greenspan Legacy, The New York Times, October 9, 2008.</ref> Born resigned as chairperson on June 1, 1999, shortly after Congress passed legislation prohibiting her agency from regulating derivatives.

In 2009, Born received the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award, along with Sheila Bair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in recognition of the ""political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed"" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Early life and education
Born graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco, California) at the age of 16. She then attended Stanford University, where she majored in English and was graduated with the class of 1961.  She initially wanted to become a doctor, but a guidance counsellor at Stanford advised her against medicine, so she majored in English literature instead.

She then attended Stanford Law School, one of only seven women in her class.  She was the first female student ever to be named president of the Stanford Law Review. She received the ""Outstanding Senior"" award and graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1964.

Legal career
Immediately after law school Born was selected as a law clerk to judge Henry Edgerton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It was during this time that she met her first husband, Jacob C. Landau, who was a journalist covering the Federal courts at the time. Following her clerkship, she became an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based international law firm of Arnold & Porter. Born was attracted to Arnold & Porter because it was one of the few major law firms to have a woman partner at that time, Carolyn Agger, who was the head of the tax practice. Born took a two-year leave of absence from Arnold & Porter to accompany her first husband to Boston, where he had received a fellowship. During that time she worked as a research assistant to law professor Alan Dershowitz.

Born's early career at Arnold & Porter focused on international trade law, in which she represented a number of Swiss industries and the government of Switzerland. She developed a practice representing clients in numerous complex litigation and arbitration cases involving financial market transactions. Among her high-profile cases was the matter of the Hunt Brothers attempt to corner the market in silver in the 1970s. She made partner at Arnold & Porter, after moving to a three-day schedule to help raise her second child, and eventually rose to be the head of the firm's derivatives practice.

Born was among the first female attorneys to systematically address inequities regarding how the laws treated women. Born and another female lawyer, Marna Tucker, taught what is considered to have been the first ""Women and the Law"" course at Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law. The class exclusively concerned prejudicial treatment of women under the laws of the United States, past and present.  Born and Tucker were surprised to discover that there was no textbook on the issue at the time.  Born is also one of the co-founders of the National Women's Law Center. Born also helped rewrite the American Bar Association rules to make it possible for more women and minorities to sit on federal bench.

During her long legal career, and into her retirement, Born did much pro bono and other types of volunteer work. She was active in the American Bar Association, the largest professional organization of lawyers in the United States.  Initially Born was named a member of the governing council of the ABA's Individual Rights Section, eventually becoming chairperson.  Born and Tucker founded the ABA Women's Caucus, the first organization of female lawyers in the ABA.  She held several other senior positions in the ABA, including being named the first woman member of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Born provided testimony and opinion on persons nominated for federal judgeships. In 1980 she was named chair of the committee.  As chair of the committee, Born was invited to address the U.S. Congress regarding the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In 1993, Born's name was floated as a possible candidate for Attorney General of the United States, but Janet Reno was nominated.

In July 2009, Nancy Pelosi appointed Brooksley Born as a commissioner to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC).

Born and the OTC derivatives market
Born was appointed to the CFTC on April 15, 1994, by President Bill Clinton. Due to litigation against Bankers Trust Company by Procter and Gamble and other corporate clients, Born and her team at the CFTC sought comments on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, a first step in the process of writing CFTC regulations to supplement the existing regulations of the Federal Reserve System,  the Options Clearing Corporation, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Born was particularly concerned about swaps, financial instruments that are traded over the counter between banks, insurance companies or other funds or companies, and thus have no transparency except to the two counterparties and the counterparties' regulators, if any.  CFTC regulation was strenuously opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. On May 7, 1998, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt joined Rubin and Greenspan in objecting to the issuance of the CFTC's concept release. Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a ""legal uncertainty"" regarding such financial instruments,  hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would ""stifle financial innovation"" and encourage financial capital to transfer its  transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies,  insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies.

In 1998, a trillion-dollar hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was near collapse.  Using mathematical models to calculate debt risk, LTCM used derivatives to leverage $5 billion into more than $1 trillion, doing business with fifteen of Wall Street's largest financial institutions.  The derivative transactions were not regulated, nor were investors able to evaluate LTCM's exposures.  Born stated, ""I thought that LTCM was exactly what I had been worried about"".  In the last weekend of September 1998, the President's working group was told that the entire American economy hung in the balance.  After intervention by the Federal Reserve, the crisis was averted.  In congressional hearings into the crisis, Greenspan acknowledged that language had been introduced into an agriculture bill that would prevent CFTC from regulating the derivatives which were at the center of the crisis that threatened the US economy.  U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) asked ""How many more failures do you think we'd have to have before some regulation in this area might be appropriate?""  In response, Greenspan brushed aside the substance of Born's warnings with the simple assertion that ""the degree of supervision of regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system"". Born's warning was that there wasn't any regulation of them.  Born's chief of staff, Michael Greenberger summed up Greenspan's position this way: ""Greenspan didn't believe that fraud was something that needed to be enforced, and he assumed she probably did. And of course, she did.""  Under heavy pressure from the financial lobby, legislation prohibiting regulation of derivatives by Born's agency was passed by the Congress.  Born resigned on June 1, 1999.

The derivatives market continued to grow yearly throughout both terms of George W. Bush's administration. On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers forced a broad recognition of a financial crisis in both the US and world capital markets.  As Lehman Brothers' failure temporarily reduced financial capital's confidence, a number of newspaper articles and television programs suggested that the failure's possible causes included the conflict between the CFTC and the other regulators.Faiola, Anthony, Nakashima, Ellen and Drew, Jill. The Crash: Risk and Regulation - What Went Wrong, The Washington Post, October 15, 2008.

Born declined to publicly comment on the unfolding 2008 crisis until March 2009, when she said: ""The market grew so enormously, with so little oversight and regulation, that it made the financial crisis much deeper and more pervasive than it otherwise would have been."" She also lamented the influence of Wall Street lobbyists on the process and the refusal of regulators to discuss even modest reforms.

An October 2009 Frontline documentary titled ""The Warning""  described Born's thwarted efforts to regulate and bring transparency to the derivatives market, and the continuing opposition thereto. The program concluded with an excerpted interview with Born sounding another warning: ""I think we will have continuing danger from these markets and that we will have repeats of the financial crisis -- may differ in details but there will be significant financial downturns and disasters attributed to this regulatory gap, over and over, until we learn from experience.""

In 2009 Born, along with Sheila Bair of the FDIC, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in recognition of the ""political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed"" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.  According to Caroline Kennedy, ""Brooksley Born recognized that the financial security of all Americans was being put at risk by the greed, negligence and opposition of  powerful and well connected interests.... The catastrophic financial events of recent months have  proved them [Born and Sheila Bair] right.""  One member of the President's working group had a change of heart about Brooksley Born.  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt stated ""I've come to know her as one of the most capable, dedicated, intelligent and committed public servants that I have ever come to know"", adding that ""I could have done much better. I could have made a difference"" in response to her warnings.

In 2010, a documentary film Inside Job further alleged that derivatives regulation was ineffective from the Clinton administration on. Along with fellow whistleblower, former IMF Chief Economist Raghuram Rajan, who was also scorned by the economic establishment, Brooksley Born was cited as one of the authorities arguing that financial derivatives increase economic risk.

 Personal life 
Born is married to Alexander E. Bennett (also retired from Arnold & Porter).  She has five adult children - two from a previous marriage to Jacob Landau and three stepchildren. Notably, Born was named a partner at Arnold & Porter while working part-time so she could raise her two young children.  When both of her children were school-age, Born returned to practice full-time.

What is the dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter following a quench to the critical point?,"\section*{Dynamical Behaviour of $O$ in Lattice Gases}

The dynamical behaviour of the anisotropic order parameter  $m$ [see Eq.~\eqref{eq:def-m} in the Letter] following a quench to the critical point is well described by
the Gaussian theory for all the three lattice gas models studied, $i.e.,$ driven lattice gas with either constant (IDLG) or random (RDLG) infinite drive and equilibrium lattice gas (LG). In other words, in the short-time regime, $m \sim t^{1/2}$ [see Eq. \eqref{eq:mt}] and the Binder cumulant $g$ of the lowest transverse mode [defined in Eq. \eqref{eq:binder}] is zero in this regime. The alternative order parameter $O,$ however, distinguishes between the driven (IDLG, RDLG) and the equilibrium (LG) lattice gases. 

In order to understand  this, we first write the phenomenological scaling form for $O$,  analogous to Eq. \eqref{eq:scalingass} in  the Letter,
\begin{eqnarray}
O (t, L_{\parallel} ; S_\Delta) = L_{\parallel}^{-\beta/[\nu(1+\Delta)]} \tilde f_O (t/L_{\parallel}^{z/(1+\Delta)} ; S_\Delta).\quad
\label{eq:Oscalingass}
\end{eqnarray}
We already remarked that, in the LG, this scaling form is not compatible with the prediction $O \sim t^{1/8}  L_{\parallel}^{-1/2}$ of the Gaussian theory.  However, following Ref. \cite{AS2002}, it can be argued that, at short times, the only dependence of $O$ on the system size $L_{\parallel}$ is of the form $O \sim L_\parallel^{-1/2}$ which is very well confirmed by numerical simulations. Accordingly,  the generic behaviour of $O$ can be assumed to be
\begin{eqnarray}
O \sim t^{\alpha} L_\parallel^{-1/2}, \label{eq:O}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha$ is a phenomenological exponent to be determined. This, along with Eq. \eqref{eq:Oscalingass}, implies $\tilde f_O(x) \sim x^{\alpha}.$ Comparing the finite-size behaviour in Eq.~\eqref{eq:O} with Eq.~\eqref{eq:Oscalingass} one actually infers,
\begin{eqnarray}
\alpha &=& \frac{1+ \Delta -2 \beta/\nu}{2 \, (4- \eta)}. \label{eq:alpha}
\end{eqnarray}
This equation, together with the hyperscaling relation $\Delta - 2 \beta/\nu= - \eta$ in two spatial dimensions, shows that the prediction $\alpha = 1/8$ of the Gaussian theory [see Eq. \eqref{eq:Ot}] can be obtained only when $\eta=0,$ which is the case for the IDLG (exactly) and the RDLG (approximately) but not for the LG. 

On the other hand,  Eq.~\eqref{eq:alpha} predicts $\alpha = 1/10$ upon substituting the values of the critical exponents corresponding to the Ising  universality class (LG). This is consistent with the numerical simulation results presented in the main text, see Fig. \ref{fig:ising}(b) therein.

\begin{figure}[th]

 \includegraphics[width=10 cm]{./compare_binder.pdf}

\caption{Comparison between the temporal evolution of the Binder cumulants $g$ corresponding to the $12^{th}$ transverse mode, $i.e.,$ with $n_\perp =12,$ in the LG (lowest curve), IDLG and RDLG (two upper curves) on a $32 \times 32$ lattice. \label{fig:b}}
 \label{fig:binder}
\end{figure}


The emergence of this new value $1/10$ of the exponent $\alpha$ must be traced back to the non-Gaussian nature of higher fluctuating modes in the LG. In fact, even though the lowest mode behaves identically in all the three models we considered,  characterized by the same behaviour of $m$, higher modes show a significant difference in the non-driven case.  


To illustrate this, we measured the Binder cumulants of higher modes which is defined  analogously to Eq.~(11), using transverse modes other than the first, i.e., with $\mu=\tilde \sigma(0,2 \pi n_\bot/L_\bot)$ and $n_\bot>1.$  
 Figure \ref{fig:b} compares the same for all the three lattice gases for the mode with $n_\perp =12$ on a $32 \times 32$ lattice. Clearly, the curve corresponding to the LG (lowest, blue) departs from Gaussian behaviour $g=0$ (in practice, $e.g.,$ $|g| \lesssim 0.005,$ corresponding to the shaded gray area) much earlier than it does for the IDLG  or RDLG (two upper curves, red and green respectively).

Accordingly, the different dynamical behaviour of $O$, which involves a sum over all modes, can be attributed to the non-Gaussian nature of the higher modes in the LG. 
Such a departure is not entirely surprising. In fact, for higher modes, mesoscopic descriptions such as the ones in Eqs. \eqref{eq:L-DLG} or \eqref{eq:g_evol} are not expected to hold, while the anisotropy at the microscopic level could be the mechanism leading to the Gaussianity of higher modes in the driven models.

",['It is well described by the Gaussian theory.'],669,multifieldqa_en,en,,322b4b2b074049aac101086797d655a21671ef5a9f366353," The dynamical behaviour of the anisotropic order. parameter $m$ following a quench to the critical point is well described by. the Gaussian theory. The alternative order parameter $O,$ distinguishes between the driven (IDLG, RDLG) and the equilibrium (LG) lattice gases. This is consistent with the numerical simulation results presented in Fig. 1. The emergence of the Binder cumulants corresponding to the transverse mode, $i.e., $n_p =12,$ in the LG (lowestest) curve, can be compared to the emergence of $n-p = 12 in the IDLG (highest) and R DLG curves. We show that the behaviour of $O$ can be assumed to be generic, with the only dependence on the system size $L_\parallel$ being $O \sim L_\ parallel^{-1/2}$ in a finite-size regime. We also show that this behaviour is compatible with the prediction $O $sim t=1/8$ of the Gaussian theory. We conclude that the theory of lattice gas evolution can be used to explain the evolution of the lowest transverse modes in a low-temporal environment. Accordingly, the different dynamical behaviour of $O$, which involves a sum over all modes, can be attributed to the non-Gaussian nature of the higher modes in the LG.

How does the performance of the PLM with decimation compare to other methods?,"\section{Introduction}
Given a data set and a model with some unknown parameters, the inverse problem aims to find the values of the model parameters that best fit the data.  
In this work, in which we focus on systems of interacting elements,
 the inverse problem concerns  the statistical inference
 of the underling interaction network and of its coupling coefficients from observed data on the dynamics  of the system. 
 Versions of this problem are encountered in physics, biology (e.g., \cite{Balakrishnan11,Ekeberg13,Christoph14}), social sciences and finance (e.g.,\cite{Mastromatteo12,yamanaka_15}), neuroscience (e.g., \cite{Schneidman06,Roudi09a,tyrcha_13}), just to cite a few, and are becoming more and more important due to the increase in the amount of data available from these fields.\\
 \indent 
 A standard approach used in statistical inference is to predict the interaction couplings by maximizing the likelihood function.
 This technique, however, requires the evaluation of the  
 
   partition function that, in the most general case, concerns a number of computations scaling exponentially with the system size.
  
  
    Boltzmann machine learning uses Monte Carlo sampling to compute the gradients of the Log-likelihood looking for stationary points \cite{Murphy12} but this method is computationally manageable only for small systems. A series of faster approximations, such as naive mean-field, independent-pair approximation \cite{Roudi09a, Roudi09b}, inversion of TAP equations \cite{Kappen98,Tanaka98}, small correlations expansion \cite{Sessak09}, adaptive TAP \cite{Opper01}, adaptive  cluster expansion \cite{Cocco12} or Bethe approximations \cite{Ricci-Tersenghi12, Nguyen12}  have, then, been developed. These techniques take as input means and correlations of observed variables and most of them assume a fully connected graph as underlying connectivity network, or expand  around it by perturbative dilution.  In most cases, network reconstruction turns out to  be not accurate for small data sizes and/or when couplings are  strong or, else, if the original interaction network is sparse.\\
\indent
 A further method, substantially improving performances for small data, is the so-called Pseudo-Likelyhood Method (PLM) \cite{Ravikumar10}. In Ref. \cite{Aurell12} Aurell and Ekeberg performed a comparison between PLM and some of the just mentioned mean-field-based algorithms on the pairwise interacting Ising-spin  ($\sigma = \pm 1$) model, showing how PLM performs sensitively better, especially on sparse graphs and in the high-coupling limit, i.e., for low temperature.
 
 In this work, we aim at performing statistical inference  on a model whose interacting variables are continuous $XY$ spins, i.e., $\sigma \equiv \left(\cos \phi,\sin \phi\right)$ with $\phi \in [0, 2\pi )$. The developed tools can, actually, be also straightforward applied  to the $p$-clock model  \cite{Potts52} where the phase $\phi$ takes discretely equispaced $p$ values  in the $2 \pi$ interval, $\phi_a =  a 2 \pi/p$, with $a= 0,1,\dots,p-1$. The $p$-clock model, else called vector Potts model, gives a hierarchy of discretization of the $XY$ model as $p$ increases. For $p=2$, one recovers the Ising model, for $p=4$ the Ashkin-Teller model \cite{Ashkin43}, for $p=6$ the ice-type model \cite{Pauling35,Baxter82} and the eight-vertex model \cite{Sutherland70,Fan70,Baxter71} for $p=8$.  
It turns out to be very useful also for numerical implementations of the continuous $XY$ model. 
Recent analysis on the multi-body $XY$ model has shown that for a limited number of discrete phase values ($p\sim 16, 32$) the thermodynamic critical properties of the $p\to\infty$ $XY$ limit are promptly recovered \cite{Marruzzo15, Marruzzo16}.  
Our main motivation to study statistical inference is that these kind of models have recently turned out to be rather useful in describing the behavior of optical systems, 
including standard mode-locking lasers \cite{Gordon02,Gat04,Angelani07,Marruzzo15} and random lasers \cite{Angelani06a,Leuzzi09a,Antenucci15a,Antenucci15b,Marruzzo16}. 
In particular, the inverse problem on the pairwise XY model analyzed here might be of help in recovering images from light propagated through random media. 


      This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. \ref{sec:model} we introduce the general model  and we discuss its  derivation also  as a model for light transmission through random scattering media. 
    In Sec. \ref{sec:plm} we introduce the PLM with $l_2$ regularization  and with decimation, two variants of the PLM respectively introduced in Ref. \cite{Wainwright06} and \cite{Aurell12} for the inverse Ising problem. 
    Here, we analyze these techniques for continuous $XY$ spins and we test them on thermalized data generated by Exchange Monte Carlo numerical simulations of the original model dynamics. In Sec. \ref{sec:res_reg} we  present the results related to the PLM-$l_2$. In Sec. \ref{sec:res_dec} the results related to the PLM with decimation are reported and its performances are compared to the PLM-$l_2$ and to a variational mean-field method analyzed in Ref. \cite{Tyagi15}. In Sec. \ref{sec:conc}, we outline conclusive remarks and perspectives.

        \section{The leading $XY$ model}
      \label{sec:model}
 The leading model we are considering is defined, for a system of $N$ angular $XY$ variables, by the Hamiltonian 
 \begin{equation}
  \mathcal{H} = - \sum_{ik}^{1,N} J_{ik} \cos{\left(\phi_i-\phi_k\right)} 
  \label{eq:HXY}
 
  \end{equation} 
  
  The $XY$ model is well known in statistical mechanics, displaying important physical
  insights, starting from the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
  transition in two dimensions\cite{Berezinskii70,Berezinskii71,Kosterlitz72} and moving to, e.g., the
  transition of liquid helium to its superfluid state \cite{Brezin82}, the roughening transition of the interface of a crystal in equilibrium with its vapor \cite{Cardy96}. In presence of disorder and frustration \cite{Villain77,Fradkin78} the model has been adopted to describe synchronization problems as the Kuramoto model \cite{Kuramoto75} and in the theoretical modeling of Josephson junction arrays \cite{Teitel83a,Teitel83b} and arrays of coupled lasers \cite{Nixon13}.
  Besides several derivations and implementations of the model in quantum and classical physics, equilibrium or out of equilibrium, ordered or fully frustrated systems, Eq. (\ref{eq:HXY}), in its generic form,
  has found applications also in other fields. A rather fascinating example being the behavior of starlings flocks  \cite{Reynolds87,Deneubourg89,Huth90,Vicsek95, Cavagna13}.
  Our interest on the $XY$ model resides, though, in optics. Phasor and phase models with pairwise and  multi-body interaction terms can, indeed, describe the behavior of electromagnetic modes in both linear and nonlinear optical systems in the analysis of problems such as light propagation and lasing \cite{Gordon02, Antenucci15c, Antenucci15d}. As couplings are strongly frustrated, these models turn out to be especially useful to the study of optical properties in random media \cite{Antenucci15a,Antenucci15b}, as in the noticeable case of random lasers \cite{Wiersma08,Andreasen11,Antenucci15e}  and they might as well be applied to linear scattering problems, e.g., propagation of waves in opaque systems or disordered fibers. 
  
  
  \subsection{A propagating wave model}
  We briefly mention a derivation of the model as a proxy for the propagation of light through random linear media. 
 Scattering of light is held responsible to obstruct our view and make objects opaque. Light rays, once that they enter the material, only exit  after getting scattered multiple times within the material. In such a disordered medium, both the direction and the phase of the propagating waves are random. Transmitted light 
 yields a disordered interference pattern typically  having low intensity, random phase and almost no resolution, called a speckle. Nevertheless, in recent years it has been realized that disorder is rather a blessing in disguise \cite{Vellekoop07,Vellekoop08a,Vellekoop08b}. Several experiments have made it possible to control the behavior of light and other optical processes in a given random disordered medium,  
 by exploiting, e.g.,  the tools developed for wavefront shaping to control the propagation of light and to engineer the confinement of light \cite{Yilmaz13,Riboli14}.
 \\
 \indent
 In a linear dielectric medium, light propagation can be described through a part of the scattering matrix, the transmission matrix $\mathbb{T}$, linking the outgoing to the incoming fields. 
 Consider the case in which there are $N_I$ incoming channels and $N_O$ outgoing ones; we can indicate with $E^{\rm in,out}_k$ the input/output electromagnetic field phasors of channel $k$. In the most general case, i.e., without making any particular assumptions on the field polarizations, each light mode and its polarization polarization state can be represented by means of the $4$-dimensional Stokes vector. Each $ t_{ki}$ element of $\mathbb{T}$, thus, is a $4 \times 4$ M{\""u}ller matrix. If, on the other hand, we know that the source is polarized and the observation is made on the same polarization, one can use a scalar model and adopt Jones calculus \cite{Goodman85,Popoff10a,Akbulut11}:
   \begin{eqnarray}
 E^{\rm out}_k = \sum_{i=1}^{N_I}  t_{ki} E^{\rm in}_i \qquad \forall~ k=1,\ldots,N_O
 \label{eq:transm}
 \end{eqnarray}
  We recall that the elements of the transmission matrix are random complex coefficients\cite{Popoff10a}. For the case of completely unpolarized modes, we can also use a scalar model similar to Eq. \eqref{eq:transm}, but whose variables are  the intensities of the outgoing/incoming fields, rather than the fields themselves.\\ 
In the following, for simplicity, we will consider Eq. (\ref{eq:transm}) as our starting point,
where $E^{\rm out}_k$, $E^{\rm in}_i$ and $t_{ki}$ are all complex scalars. 
If Eq. \eqref{eq:transm} holds for any $k$, we can write:
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \int \prod_{k=1}^{N_O} dE^{\rm out}_k \prod_{k=1}^{N_O}\delta\left(E^{\rm out}_k - \sum_{j=1}^{N_I}  t_{kj} E^{\rm in}_j \right) = 1
  \nonumber
  \\
  \label{eq:deltas}
  \end{eqnarray}

 Observed data are a noisy representation of the true values of the fields. Therefore, in inference problems it is statistically more meaningful to take that noise into account in a probabilistic way, 
 rather than looking  at the precise solutions of the exact equations (whose parameters are unknown). 
 To this aim we can introduce Gaussian distributions whose limit for zero variance are the Dirac deltas in Eq. (\ref{eq:deltas}).
 Moreover, we move to consider the ensemble of all possible solutions of Eq. (\ref{eq:transm}) at given $\mathbb{T}$, looking at  all configurations of input fields. We, thus, define the function:
 
   \begin{eqnarray}
  Z &\equiv &\int_{{\cal S}_{\rm in}} \prod_{j=1}^{N_I}  dE^{\rm in}_j \int_{{\cal S}_{\rm out}}\prod_{k=1}^{N_O} dE^{\rm out}_k 
  \label{def:Z}
\\
    \times
  &&\prod_{k=1}^{N_O}
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \Delta^2}}  \exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2 \Delta^2}\left|
  E^{\rm out}_k -\sum_{j=1}^{N_I}  t_{kj} E^{\rm in}_j\right|^2
\right\} 
\nonumber
 \end{eqnarray}
   We stress that the integral of Eq. \eqref{def:Z} is not exactly a Gaussian integral. Indeed, starting from Eq. \eqref{eq:deltas}, two constraints on the electromagnetic field intensities must be taken into account. 

  The space of solutions is  delimited by the total power ${\cal P}$ received by system, i.e., 
  ${\cal S}_{\rm in}: \{E^{\rm in} |\sum_k I^{\rm in}_k = \mathcal{P}\}$, also implying  a constraint on the total amount of energy that is transmitted through the medium, i. e., 
  ${\cal S}_{\rm out}:\{E^{\rm out} |\sum_k I^{\rm out}_k=c\mathcal{P}\}$, where the attenuation factor  $c<1$ accounts for total losses.
  As we will see more in details in the following, being interested in inferring the transmission matrix through the PLM, we can omit to explicitly include these terms in Eq. \eqref{eq:H_J} since they do not depend on $\mathbb{T}$ not adding any information on the gradients with respect to the elements of $\mathbb{T}$.
  
 Taking the same number of incoming and outcoming channels, $N_I=N_O=N/2$, and  ordering the input fields in the first $N/2$ mode indices and the output fields in the last $N/2$ indices, we can drop the ``in'' and ``out'' superscripts and formally write $Z$  as a partition function
    \begin{eqnarray}
        \label{eq:z}
 && Z =\int_{\mathcal S} \prod_{j=1}^{N} dE_j \left(   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \Delta^2}} \right)^{N/2} 
 \hspace*{-.4cm} \exp\left\{
  -\frac{ {\cal H} [\{E\};\mathbb{T}] }{2\Delta^2}
  \right\}
  \\
&&{\cal H} [\{E\};\mathbb{T}] =
-  \sum_{k=1}^{N/2}\sum_{j=N/2+1}^{N} \left[E^*_j t_{jk} E_k + E_j t^*_{kj} E_k^* 
\right]
 \nonumber
\\
&&\qquad\qquad \qquad + \sum_{j=N/2+1}^{N} |E_j|^2+ \sum_{k,l}^{1,N/2}E_k
U_{kl} E_l^*
 \nonumber
 \\
 \label{eq:H_J}
 &&\hspace*{1.88cm } = - \sum_{nm}^{1,N} E_n J_{nm} E_m^*
 \end{eqnarray}
 where ${\cal H}$ is a real-valued function by construction, we have introduced the effective input-input coupling matrix
\begin{equation}
U_{kl} \equiv \sum_{j=N/2+1}^{N}t^*_{lj} t_{jk} 
 \label{def:U}
 \end{equation}
 and the whole interaction matrix reads (here $\mathbb{T} \equiv \{ t_{jk} \}$)
 \begin{equation}
 \label{def:J}
 \mathbb J\equiv \left(\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}
 \phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}\\
 \phantom{()}&-\mathbb{U} \phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&{\mathbb{T}}&\phantom{()}\\
\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}\\
 \hline
\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}\\
 \phantom{()}& \mathbb   T^\dagger&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}& - \mathbb{I} &\phantom{()}\\
\phantom{a}&\phantom{a}&\phantom{a}&\phantom{a}&\phantom{a}&\phantom{a}\\
 \end{array}\right)
 \end{equation}
 
 Determining the electromagnetic complex amplitude configurations that minimize the {\em cost function} ${\cal H}$, Eq.  (\ref{eq:H_J}),  means to maximize the overall distribution peaked around the solutions of the transmission Eqs. (\ref{eq:transm}). As the variance $\Delta^2\to 0$, eventually, the initial set of Eqs. (\ref{eq:transm}) are recovered. The ${\cal H}$ function, thus, plays the role of an Hamiltonian and  $\Delta^2$ the role of a noise-inducing temperature. The exact numerical problem corresponds to the zero temperature limit of the statistical mechanical problem. Working with real data, though, which are noisy, a finite ``temperature''
  allows for a better representation of the ensemble of solutions to the sets of equations of continuous variables. 
  

  
  
  Now, we can express every phasor in Eq. \eqref{eq:z}  as $E_k = A_k e^{\imath \phi_k}$. As a working hypothesis we will consider the intensities $A_k^2$ as either homogeneous or as \textit{quenched} with respect to phases.
The first condition occurs, for instance, to the input intensities $|E^{\rm in}_k|$ produced by a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) with homogeneous illumination \cite{Popoff11}.
With \textit{quenched} here we mean, instead, that the intensity of each mode is the same for every solution of Eq. \eqref{eq:transm} at fixed $\mathbb T$.
We stress that, including intensities in the model does not preclude the inference analysis but it is out of the focus of the present work and will be considered elsewhere. 

If all intensities are uniform in input and in output, this amount to a constant rescaling for each one of the four sectors of matrix $\mathbb J$ in Eq. (\ref{def:J}) that will not change the properties of the matrices.
For instance, if the original transmission matrix is unitary, so it will be the rescaled one and the matrix $\mathbb U$ will be  diagonal.
Otherwise, if intensities are \textit{quenched}, i.e., they can be considered as constants in Eq. (\ref{eq:transm}),
they are inhomogeneous with respect to phases. The generic Hamiltonian element will, therefore, rescale as 
  \begin{eqnarray}
  E^*_n J_{nm} E_m = J_{nm} A_n A_m e^{\imath (\phi_n-\phi_m)} \to J_{nm} e^{\imath (\phi_n-\phi_m)}
  \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}
  and the properties of the original  $J_{nm}$ components are not conserved  in the rescaled one. In particular, we have no argument, anymore, to possibly set the rescaled $U_{nm}\propto \delta_{nm}$.
  Eventually, we end up with the complex couplings $XY$ model, whose real-valued Hamiltonian is written as
 \begin{eqnarray}
  \mathcal{H}& = &  - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{nm} J_{nm} e^{-\imath (\phi_n - \phi_m)}  + \mbox{c.c.} 
    \label{eq:h_im}
\\    &=&  - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{nm} \left[J^R_{nm} \cos(\phi_n - \phi_m)+
  J^I_{nm}\sin (\phi_n - \phi_m)\right] 
  \nonumber
 \end{eqnarray}
where $J_{nm}^R$ and $J_{nm}^I$ are the real and imaginary parts of $J_{nm}$. Being $\mathbb J$  Hermitian, $J^R_{nm}=J^R_{mn}$ is symmetric and $J_{nm}^I=-J_{mn}^I$ is skew-symmetric.

\begin{comment}
\textcolor{red}{
F: comment about quenched:
I think that to obtain the XY model, it is not necessary that the intensities are strictly quenched (that is also a quite unfeasible situation, I guess).
Indeed eq (2) does not deal with the dynamics of the modes, but just connect the in and out ones.
For this, what it is necessary to have the XY model, it is that the intensities are always the same on the different samples
(so that the matrix $t_{ij}$ is the same for different phase data). If the intensities are fixed, then they can be incorporated in $t_{ij}$ and eq (2) can be written just for phases as described. \\

  \section{Pseudolikelihood Maximization}
  \label{sec:plm}
The inverse problem consists in the reconstruction of the parameters $J_{nm}$ of the Hamiltonian, Eq. (\ref{eq:h_im}).  
Given a set of $M$ data configurations of $N$ spins
 $\bm\sigma = \{ \cos \phi_i^{(\mu)},\sin \phi_i^{(\mu)} \}$, $i = 1,\dots,N$ and $\mu=1,\dots,M$, we want to \emph{infer} the couplings:
 \begin{eqnarray}
\bm \sigma  \rightarrow  \mathbb{J} 
\nonumber
 \end{eqnarray}
 With this purpose in mind,
 in the rest of this section we implement the working equations for the techniques used. 
 In order to test our methods, we generate the input data, i.e., the configurations, by Monte-Carlo simulations of the model.
 The joint probability distribution of the $N$ variables $\bm{\phi}\equiv\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_N\}$, follows the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution:
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:p_xy}
 P(\bm{\phi}) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\beta \mathcal{H\left(\bm{\phi}\right)}} \quad \mbox{ where } \quad Z = \int \prod_{k=1}^N d\phi_k  e^{-\beta \mathcal{H\left(\bm{\phi}\right)}}  
 \end{equation}
 and where we denote $\beta=\left( 2\Delta^2 \right)^{-1}$ with respect to Eq. (\ref{def:Z}) formalism.
 In order to stick to usual statistical inference notation, in the following we will rescale the couplings by a factor $\beta / 2$: $\beta J_{ij}/2 \rightarrow J_{ij}$. 
 The main idea of the PLM is to work with the conditional probability distribution of one variable $\phi_i$ given all other variables, 
 $\bm{\phi}_{\backslash i}$:
 
  \begin{eqnarray}
	\nonumber
   P(\phi_i | \bm{\phi}_{\backslash i}) &=& \frac{1}{Z_i} \exp \left \{ {H_i^x (\bm{\phi}_{\backslash i})
  	\cos \phi_i + H_i^y (\bm{\phi}_{\backslash i}) \sin \phi_i } \right \}
	\\
 \label{eq:marginal_xy}
	&=&\frac{e^{H_i(\bm{\phi}_{\backslash i}) \cos{\left(\phi_i-\alpha_i(\bm{\phi}_{\backslash i})\right)}}}{2 \pi I_0(H_i)}
  \end{eqnarray}
  where $H_i^x$ and $H_i^y$ are defined as
   \begin{eqnarray}
   H_i^x (\bm{\phi}_{\backslash i})  &=& \sum_{j (\neq i)} J^R_{ij} \cos \phi_j  - \sum_{j  (\neq i) } J_{ij}^{I} \sin \phi_j \phantom{+  h^R_i} \label{eq:26} \\
   H_i^y  (\bm{\phi}_{\backslash i})  &=&  \sum_{j  (\neq i)} J^R_{ij}  \sin \phi_j  + \sum_{j  (\neq i) } J_{ij}^{I}   \cos \phi_j \phantom{ + h_i^{I} }\label{eq:27}
   \end{eqnarray}
and $H_i= \sqrt{(H_i^x)^2 + (H_i^y)^2}$, $\alpha_i = \arctan H_i^y/H_i^x$   and we introduced the modified Bessel function of the first kind:
  \begin{equation}
  \nonumber
   I_k(x) = \frac{1}{2 \pi}\int_{0}^{2 \pi} d \phi e^{x \cos{ \phi}}\cos{k \phi}
  \end{equation}
  
   Given $M$ observation samples $\bm{\phi}^{(\mu)}=\{\phi^\mu_1,\ldots,\phi^\mu_N\}$, $\mu = 1,\dots, M$, the
   pseudo-loglikelihood for the variable $i$ is given by the logarithm of Eq. (\ref{eq:marginal_xy}),
   \begin{eqnarray}
   \label{eq:L_i}
   L_i &=& \frac{1}{M}  \sum_{\mu = 1}^M  \ln P(\phi_i^{(\mu)}|\bm{\phi}^{(\mu)}_{\backslash i})
   \\
   \nonumber
   & =&  \frac{1}{M}  \sum_{\mu = 1}^M  \left[ H_i^{(\mu)} \cos( \phi_i^{(\mu)} - \alpha_i^{(\mu)}) - \ln  2 \pi I_0\left(H_i^{(\mu)}\right)\right] \, .
    \end{eqnarray}
The underlying idea of PLM is that an approximation of the true parameters of the model is obtained for values that maximize the functions $L_i$.
The specific maximization scheme differentiates the different techniques.


   
   
   \subsection{PLM with $l_2$ regularization}
   Especially for the case of sparse graphs, it is useful to add a regularizer, which prevents the maximization routine to move towards high values of 
   $J_{ij}$ and $h_i$ without converging. We will adopt an $l_2$ regularization so that the Pseudolikelihood function (PLF) at site $i$  reads:
   \begin{equation}\label{eq:plf_i}
  {\cal L}_i = L_i
  - \lambda \sum_{i \neq j} \left(J_{ij}^R\right)^2 - \lambda \sum_{i \neq j} \left(J_{ij}^I\right)^2  
   \end{equation}
   with $\lambda>0$.
   Note that the values of $\lambda$ have to be chosen arbitrarily, but not too large, in order not to overcome $L_i$.
   The standard implementation of the PLM consists in maximizing each ${\cal L}_i$, for $i=1\dots N$, separately. The expected values of the couplings are then:
   \begin{equation}
   \{ J_{i j}^*\}_{j\in \partial i} :=  \mbox{arg max}_{ \{ J_{ij} \}}
    \left[{\cal L}_i\right]
   \end{equation}
   In this way, we obtain two estimates for the coupling $J_{ij}$, one from maximization of ${\cal L}_i$, $J_{ij}^{(i)}$, and another one from ${\cal L}_j$, say $J_{ij}^{(j)}$.
    Since the original Hamiltonian of the $XY$ model is Hermitian, we know that the real part of the couplings is symmetric while the imaginary part is skew-symmetric. 
   
     The final estimate for $J_{ij}$ can then be obtained  averaging the two results:
  
  
  
   \begin{equation}\label{eq:symm}
   J_{ij}^{\rm inferred} = \frac{J_{ij}^{(i)} + \bar{J}_{ij}^{(j)}}{2} 
   \end{equation}
   where with $\bar{J}$ we indicate the complex conjugate.
   It is worth noting that the pseudolikelihood $L_i$, Eq. \eqref{eq:L_i}, is characterized by the
   following properties: (i) the normalization term of Eq.\eqref{eq:marginal_xy} can be
   computed analytically at odd with the {\em full} likelihood case that
   in general require a computational time which scales exponentially
   with the size of the systems; (ii) the $\ell_2$-regularized pseudolikelihood
   defined in Eq.\eqref{eq:plf_i} is strictly concave (i.e. it has a single
   maximizer)\cite{Ravikumar10}; (iii) it is consistent, i.e. if $M$ samples are
   generated by a model $P(\phi | J*)$ the maximizer tends to $J*$
   for $M\rightarrow\infty$\cite{besag1975}. Note also that (iii) guarantees that  
   $|J^{(i)}_{ij}-J^{(j)}_{ij}| \rightarrow 0$ for $M\rightarrow \infty$.
   In Secs. \ref{sec:res_reg}, \ref{sec:res_dec} 
   we report the results obtained and we analyze the performances of the PLM having taken the configurations from Monte-Carlo simulations of models whose details are known.
   

   
   \subsection{PLM with decimation}
   Even though the PLM with $l_2$-regularization allows to dwell the inference towards the low temperature region and in the low sampling case with better performances that mean-field methods, in some situations some couplings are overestimated and not at all symmetric. Moreover, in the technique there is the bias of the $l_2$ regularizer.
   Trying to overcome these problems, Decelle and Ricci-Tersenghi introduced a new method \cite{Decelle14}, known as PLM + decimation: the algorithm maximizes the sum of the $L_i$,
   \begin{eqnarray}
    {\cal L}\equiv \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \mbox{L}_i
    \end{eqnarray}  
    and, then, it recursively set to zero couplings which are estimated very small. We expect that as long as we are setting to zero couplings that are unnecessary to fit the data, there should be not much changing on ${\cal L}$. Keeping on with decimation, a point is reached where ${\cal L}$ decreases abruptly indicating  that relevant couplings are being decimated and under-fitting is taking place.
   Let us define  by $x$  the fraction of non-decimated couplings. To have a quantitative measure for the halt criterion of the decimation process, a tilted ${\cal L}$ is defined as,
   \begin{eqnarray}
  \mathcal{L}_t &\equiv& \mathcal{L}  - x \mathcal{L}_{\textup{max}} - (1-x) \mathcal{L}_{\textup{min}} \label{$t$PLF} 
   \end{eqnarray}
   where 
   \begin{itemize}
   \item $\mathcal{L}_{\textup{min}}$ is the pseudolikelyhood of a model with independent variables. In the XY case: $\mathcal{L}_{\textup{min}}=-\ln{2 \pi}$.
   \item
   $\mathcal{L}_{\textup{max}}$ is the pseudolikelyhood in the fully-connected model and it is maximized over all the $N(N-1)/2$ possible couplings. 
   \end{itemize}
   At the first step, when $x=1$, $\mathcal{L}$ takes value $\mathcal{L}_{\rm max}$ and  $\mathcal{L}_t=0$. On the last step, for an empty graph, i.e., $x=0$, $\mathcal{L}$ takes the value $\mathcal{L}_{\rm min}$ and, hence, again $\mathcal{L}_t =0$. 
   In the intermediate steps, during the decimation procedure, as $x$ is decreasing from $1$ to $0$, one observes firstly that $\mathcal{L}_t$ increases linearly and, then, it displays an abrupt decrease indicating that from this point on relevant couplings are being decimated\cite{Decelle14}. In Fig. \ref{Jor1-$t$PLF} we give an instance of this behavior for the 2D short-range XY model with ordered couplings. We notice that the maximum point of $\mathcal{L}_t$ coincides with the minimum point of the reconstruction error, the latter defined as 
   \begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:errj}
   \mbox{err}_J \equiv \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i<j} (J^{\rm inferred}_{ij} -J^{\rm true}_{ij})^2}{N(N-1)/2}} \label{err}
   \end{eqnarray}
  We stress that the ${\cal L}_t$ maximum is obtained ignoring the underlying graph, while the err$_J$ minimum can be evaluated once the true graph has been reconstructed. 
   
     \begin{figure}[t!]
   	\centering
   	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Jor1_dec_tPLF_new.eps}
   	\caption{The tilted likelyhood ${\cal L}_t$ curve and the reconstruction error vs the number of decimated couplings  for an ordered, real-valued J on 2D XY model with $N=64$ spins. The peak of ${\cal L}_t$ coincides with the dip of the error.}  
   	\label{Jor1-$t$PLF}
   \end{figure} 
       
   
   In the next sections we will show the results obtained on the  $XY$ model analyzing the performances of the two methods and comparing them also with a mean-field method \cite{Tyagi15}.
   
  
    
   \section{Inferred couplings with PLM-$l_2$}
    \label{sec:res_reg}
    \subsection{$XY$ model with real-valued couplings}
    
    In order to obtain the vector of couplings, $J_{ij}^{\rm inferred}$ the function $-\mathcal{L}_i$ is minimized through the vector of derivatives ${\partial \mathcal{L}_i}/\partial J_{ij}$. The process is repeated for all the couplings obtaining then a fully connected adjacency matrix. The results here presented are obtained with $\lambda = 0.01$.
   For the minimization we have used the MATLAB routine \emph{minFunc\_2012}\cite{min_func}. 
      
      \begin{figure}[t!]
    	\centering
    	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Jor11_2D_l2_JR_soJR_TPJR}
    	\caption{Top panels: instances of single site coupling reconstruction for the case of $N=64$ XY spins on a 2D lattice with ordered $J$ (left column) and bimodal distributed $J$ (right column). 
    	
    	Bottom panels: sorted couplings.}
    	\label{PL-Jor1}
    \end{figure}

   
To produce the data by means of numerical Monte Carlo simulations a system with $N=64$  spin variables  is considered on a deterministic 2D lattice with periodic boundary conditions. 
Each spin has then connectivity $4$, i.e., we expect to infer an adjacency matrix with $N c = 256$ couplings different from zero. 
The dynamics of the simulated model is based on the Metropolis algorithm and parallel tempering\cite{earl05} is used to speed up the thermalization of the system.
The thermalization is tested looking at the average energy over logarithmic time windows and
the acquisition of independent configurations
starts only after the system is well thermalized.

   For the values of the couplings we considered two cases: an ordered case, indicated in the figure as  $J$ ordered (e.g., left column of Fig. \ref{PL-Jor1}) where the couplings can take values $J_{ij}=0,J$, with $J=1$, 
   and a quenched disordered case, indicated in the figures as  $J$ disordered (e.g., right column of Fig. \ref{PL-Jor1})
   where the couplings can take also  negative values, i.e., 
    $J_{ij}=0,J,-J$, with a certain probability.  The results here presented were obtained with bimodal distributed $J$s: 
   
    $P(J_{ij}=J)=P(J_{ij}=-J)=1/2$.  The performances of the PLM have shown not to depend on $P(J)$. 
   
    We recall that in Sec. \ref{sec:plm} we used the temperature-rescaled notation, i.e., $J_{ij}$ stands for $J_{ij}/T$. 
   
    To analyze the performances of the PLM, in Fig. \ref{PL-Jor1} the inferred couplings, $\mathbb{J}^R_{\rm inf}$, are shown on top of the original couplings,  $\mathbb{J}^R_{\rm true}$.
     The first figure (from top) in the left column shows  the $\mathbb{J}^R_{\rm inf}$ (black) and the $\mathbb{J}^R_{\rm tru}$ (green) for a given spin
     at temperature $T/J=0.7$ and number of samples  $M=1024$. PLM appears to reconstruct the correct couplings, though zero couplings are always given a small inferred non-zero value. 
     In the left column of Fig.  \ref{PL-Jor1},  both the $\mathbb{J}^R_{\rm{inf}}$ and the $\mathbb{J}^R_{\rm{tru}}$ are sorted in decreasing order and plotted on top of each other. 
     We can clearly see that $\mathbb{J}^R_{\rm inf}$ reproduces the expected step function. Even though the jump is smeared, the difference between inferred couplings corresponding to the set of non-zero couplings 
     and to the set of zero couplings can be clearly appreciated.
     Similarly, the plots in the right column of Fig. \ref{PL-Jor1} show the results obtained for the case with  bimodal disordered couplings, for the same working temperature and number of samples. 
     In particular, note that the algorithm infers half positive and half negative couplings, as expected.
     
     
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Jor11_2D_l2_errJ_varT_varM}
\caption{Reconstruction error $\mbox{err}_J$, cf. Eq. (\ref{eq:errj}), plotted as a function of temperature (left) for three values of the number of samples $M$ and  as a function $M$ (right) for three values of temperature in the ordered system, i.e., $J_{ij}=0,1$. 
The system size is $N=64$.}
\label{PL-err-Jor1}
\end{figure}

In order to analyze the effects of the number of samples and of the temperature regimes, we plot in Fig. \ref{PL-err-Jor1} the reconstruction error, Eq. (\ref{err}), as a function of temperature for three different sample sizes $M=64,128$ and $512$. 
The error is seen to sharply rise al low temperature, incidentally, in the ordered case, for  $T<T_c \sim 0.893$, which is the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature of the 2XY model\cite{Olsson92}. 
 However, we can see that if only $M=64$ samples are considered, $\mbox{err}_J$ remains high independently on the working temperature. 
 In the right plot of Fig. \ref{PL-err-Jor1},  $\mbox{err}_J$ is plotted as a function of $M$ for three different working temperatures $T/J=0.4,0.7$ and $1.3$. As we expect, 
 $\mbox{err}_J$  decreases as $M$ increases. This effect was observed also with mean-field inference techniques on the same model\cite{Tyagi15}.

To better understand the performances of the algorithms, in Fig. \ref{PL-varTP-Jor1} we show several True Positive (TP) curves obtained for various values of $M$ at three different temperatures $T$. As $M$ is large and/or temperature is not too small,  we are able to reconstruct correctly all the couplings present in the system (see bottom plots).
The True Positive curve displays how many times the inference method finds a true link of the original network  as a function of the index of the vector of sorted absolute value of reconstructed couplings $J_{ij}^{\rm inf}$. 
The index $n_{(ij)}$ represents the related spin couples $(ij)$. The TP curve is obtained as follows: 
first  the values $|J^{\rm inf}_{ij}|$ are sorted in descending order and  the spin pairs $(ij)$ are ordered according to the sorting position of $|J^{\rm inf}_{ij}|$. Then,
     	a cycle over the ordered set of pairs $(ij)$, indexed by $n_{(ij)}$, is performed, comparing with the original network coupling $J^{\rm true}_{ij}$ and verifying whether it is zero or not. The true positive curve is computed as
\begin{equation}
\mbox{TP}[n_{(ij)}]= \frac{\mbox{TP}\left[n_{(ij)}-1\right] (n_{ij}-1)+ 1 -\delta_{J^{\rm true}_{ij},0}}{n_{(ij)}}
\end{equation}
As far as $J^{\rm true}_{ij} \neq 0$, TP$=1$. As soon as the true coupling of a given $(ij)$ couple in the sorted list is zero, the TP curve departs from one. 
In our case, where the connectivity per spin of the original system is  $c=4$ and there are $N=64$ spins, we know that we will have  $256$ non-zero couplings.  
     	If the inverse problem is successful, hence, we expect a steep decrease of the TP curve when  $n_{ij}=256$ is overcome.

In Fig. \ref{PL-varTP-Jor1}
it is  shown that,  almost independently of $T/J$, the TP score improves as $M$ increases. Results are plotted for three different temperatures, $T=0.4,1$ and $2.2$, with increasing number of samples $M = 64, 128,512$ and $1024$ (clockwise). 
We can clearly appreciate the improvement in temperature if the size of the data-set is not very large: for small $M$, $T=0.4$ performs better. 
When $M$ is high enough (e.g., $M=1024$), instead, the TP curves do not appear to be strongly influenced by the temperature.

\subsection{$XY$ model with complex-valued couplings}
For the complex $XY$ we have to contemporary  infer $2$ apart coupling matrices,  $J^R_{i j}$ and $J^I_{i j}$.  As before, a system of $N=64$ spins is considered on a 2D lattice.
For the couplings we have considered both ordered and bimodal disordered cases.
In Fig. \ref{PL-Jor3}, a single row of the matrix $J$ (top) and the whole sorted couplings (bottom) are displayed for the ordered model (same legend as in Fig. \ref{PL-Jor1}) for the real, $J^R$ (left column), and the imaginary part, $J^I$.

The black line indicates the expected number of decimated couplings, $x^*=(N (N-1) - N c)/2=1888$. As we can see, as $M$ increases, the maximum point of ${\cal L}_t$ approaches $x^*$. Bottom: Different ${\cal L}_t$ curves obtained for different values of T with $M=2048$. We can see that, with this value of $M$, no differences can be appreciated on the maximum points of the different  ${\cal L}_t$ curves.}

    	\label{PLF_peak_statistics}
    \end{figure}
      
      For the ordered real-valued XY model we show in Fig. \ref{var-$t$PLF}, top panel, the outcome on the tilted pseudolikelyhood, $\mathcal{L}_t$ Eq. \eqref{$t$PLF}, of the progressive decimation: from a fully connected lattice  down to an empty lattice. The figure shows the behaviour of $\mathcal{L}_t$ for three different data sizes $M$. A clear data size dependence of the maximum point of  $\mathcal{L}_t$, signalling the most likely value for decimation, is shown. For small $M$ the most likely number of  couplings is overestimated and for increasing $M$ it tends to the true value, as displayed in Fig. \ref{PLF_peak_statistics}.  In the bottom panel of Fig. \ref{var-$t$PLF} we display instead different 
 $\mathcal{L}_t$ curves obtained for three different values of $T$.
  Even though the values of $\mathcal{L}_t$ decrease with increasing temperature, the value of the most likely number of decimated couplings appears to be quite independent on $T$ with $M=2048$ number of samples.
In Fig. \ref{fig:Lt_complex} we eventually display the tilted pseudolikelyhood for a 2D network with complex valued ordered couplings, where the decimation of the real and imaginary coupling matrices proceeds in parallel, that is, 
when a real coupling is small enough to be decimated its imaginary part is also decimated, and vice versa.
One can see that though the apart errors for the real and imaginary parts are different in absolute values, they display the same dip, to be compared with the maximum point of $\mathcal{L}_t$.

     Once the most likely network has been identified through the decimation procedure, we perform the same analysis displayed in Fig. \ref{Jor1_dec}  for ordered and then quenched disordered real-valued couplings
and in Fig. \ref{Jor3_dec} for  complex-valued ordered couplings.  In comparison to the results shown in Sec. \ref{sec:res_reg},
  the PLM with decimation leads to rather cleaner results. In Figs. \ref{MF_PL_err} and \ref{MF_PL_TP} we compare the performances of the PLM with decimation in respect to ones of the PLM with $l_2$-regularization. These two techniques are also analysed in respect to a mean-field technique previously implemented on the same XY systems\cite{Tyagi15}.
  
    For what concerns the network of connecting links, in Fig. \ref{MF_PL_TP} we compare the TP curves obtained with the three techniques. The results refer to the case of ordered and real valued couplings, but similar behaviours were obtained for the other cases analysed. 
  The four graphs are related to different sample sizes, with $M$ increasing clockwise. When $M$ is high enough, all techniques reproduce the true network. 
  However, for lower values of $M$ the performances of the PLM with $l_2$ regularization and with decimation drastically overcome those ones of the previous mean field technique. 
  In particular, for $M=256$ the PLM techniques still reproduce the original network while the mean-field method fails to find more than half of the couplings. 
  When $M=128$, the network is clearly reconstructed only through the PLM with decimation while the PLM with $l_2$ regularization underestimates the couplings. 
  Furthermore, we notice that the PLM method with decimation is able to clearly infer the network of interaction even when $M=N$ signalling that it could be considered also in the under-sampling regime $M<N$.  
 
 
In Fig. \ref{MF_PL_err} we compare the temperature behaviour of the reconstruction error.
In can be observed that for all temperatures and for all sample sizes  the reconstruction error, ${\rm err_J}$, (plotted here in log-scale) obtained with the PLM+decimation is always smaller than 
that one obtained with the other techniques. The temperature behaviour of ${\rm err_J}$ agrees with the one already observed for Ising spins in \cite{Nguyen12b} and for XY spins  in \cite{Tyagi15} with a mean-field approach:  ${\rm err_J}$ displays a minimum around $T\simeq 1$ and then it increases for very lower $T$; however,
 the error obtained with the PLM with decimation is several times smaller  than the error estimated by the other methods.



 
 

     
     \section{Conclusions}
     \label{sec:conc}


Different statistical inference methods have been applied to the inverse problem of the XY model.
After a short review of techniques based on pseudo-likelihood and their formal generalization to the model we have tested their performances against data generated by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations of known instances
with diluted, sparse, interactions.

The main outcome is that the best performances are obtained by means of the  pseudo-likelihood method combined with decimation. Putting to zero (i.e., decimating) very weak bonds, this technique turns out to be very precise for  problems whose real underlying interaction network is sparse, i.e., the number of couplings per variable does not scale with number of variables.
The PLM + decimation method is compared to the PLM + regularization method, with $\ell_2$ regularization and to a mean-field-based method. The behavior of the quality of the network reconstruction is analyzed by looking at the overall sorted couplings and at the single site couplings, comparing them with the real network, and at the true positive curves in all three approaches. In the PLM +decimation method, moreover, the identification of the number of decimated bonds at which the tilted pseudo-likelihood is maximum allows for a precise estimate of the total number of bonds. Concerning this technique, it is also shown that the network with the most likely number of bonds is also the one of least reconstruction error, where not only the prediction of the presence of a bond is estimated but also its value.

The behavior of the inference quality in temperature and in the size of data samples is also investigated, basically confirming the low $T$ behavior hinted by Nguyen and Berg \cite{Nguyen12b} for the Ising model. In temperature, in particular, the reconstruction error curve displays a minimum at a low temperature, close to the critical point in those cases in which a critical behavior occurs, and a sharp increase as temperature goes to zero. The decimation method, once again, appears to enhance this minimum of the reconstruction error of almost an order of magnitude with respect to other methods.
 
The techniques displayed and the results obtained in this work can be of use in any of the many systems whose theoretical representation is given by Eq. \eqref{eq:HXY} or Eq. \eqref{eq:h_im}, some of which are recalled in Sec. \ref{sec:model}. In particular, a possible application can be the field of light waves propagation through random media and the corresponding problem of the  reconstruction of an object seen through an opaque medium or a disordered optical fiber \cite{Vellekoop07,Vellekoop08a,Vellekoop08b, Popoff10a,Akbulut11,Popoff11,Yilmaz13,Riboli14}.

Versions of this problem are encountered in physics, biology, social sciences and finance. A standard approach used in statistical inference is to predict the interaction couplings by maximizing the likelihood function. A further method, substantially improving performances for small data, is the so-called Pseudo-Likelyhood Method (PLM) The developed tools can, actually, be also straightforward applied  to the $p$-clock model, else called vector Potts model, which gives a hierarchy of discretization of the $XY$ model as $p $ increases. We aim at performing statistical inference on a model whose interacting variables are continuous $ XY$ spins, i.e., $\sigma \equiv \left(\cos \phi,\sin \phi\right)$ with $a= 0,1,\dots,p-1$ and $b=0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,82 The inverse problem on the pairwise XY model analyzed here might be of help in recovering images from light propagated through random media. The $XY$ model is well known in statistical mechanics, displaying important physical insights. Phasor and phase models with pairwise and multi-body interaction terms can, indeed, describe the behavior of electromagnetic modes in both linear and nonlinear optical systems. We briefly mention a derivation of the model for light transmission through random scattering media. Scattering of light is held to obstruct our view and make our view of objects, once they enter the material, only after they exit the material. The model has been adopted to describe synchronization problems as the Kuramoto model, and in the theoretical modeling of Josephson junction arrays and arrays of coupled lasers. It has found applications also in other fields, such as in the study of starlings flocks and in quantum and classical physics, as well as in optical systems, including random lasers and opaque fibers. We conclude with conclusive remarks and perspectives on the model and its applications to light propagation and lasing, and its derivation as a proxy for the propagation of light through linear media. We also mention a model for the propagating wave model, which might be applied to linear scattering problems, e.g., propagation of waves in opaque systems or ordered fibers. In a linear dielectric medium, light propagation can be described through a part of the scattering matrix, the transmission matrix. In the most general case, each light mode and its polarization polarization state can be represented by means of the $4$-dimensional Stokes vector. Observed data are a noisy representation of the true values of the fields. In inference problems it is statistically more meaningful to take that noise into account in a probabilistic way, rather than looking at the precise solutions of the exact equations (whose parameters are unknown). To this aim we can introduce Gaussian distributions whose limit for zero variance are the Dirac deltas in Eq. (\ref{eq:deltas)).. We define the function:. We move to consider the ensemble of all possible solutions of E. (eq:transm) at given $\mathbb{T}$, looking at all configurations of fields, thus, defining the function. We can also use a scalar model similar to Eq, but whose variables are the intensities of the outgoing/incoming fields, rather. than the fields themselves. We recall that the elements of the transmission Matrix are random complex coefficients. We use a complex scalar for the case of completely unpolarized modes. ring the transmission matrix through the PLM, we can omit to explicitly include these terms in Eq. \eqref eq:H_J. Taking the same number of incoming and outcoming channels, $N_I=N_O=N/2$, we can drop the ``in'' and ``out'' superscripts and formally write $Z$  as a partition function. Determining the electromagnetic complex configurations that minimize the amplitude that eventually peaked, we call this the initial set of Eqs (Eq. Eqs). As the variance of the transmission Eqs eventually set to 0, the initial cost of the set is 0, and we call it the cost function. We have introduced the effective input- input coupling matrix, where $H$ is a real-valued function by construction, and the whole interaction matrix reads (here $\mathbb{T} \equiv t_{jk} \}$). We call the overall distribution of the distribution around the solutions (Eqs. EQ. Eq.) the ""effective transmission"" matrix, which is the set of all the possible configurations that can be chosen to maximize the amplitude of a given solution. We call this ""the effective transmission"" Matrix, or ""effective input-input coupling matrix,"" is the matrix that maximizes the amplitude. In order to obtain the XY model, it is not necessary that the intensities are strictly quenched (that is also a quite unfeasible situation, I guess).Indeed eq (2) does not deal with the dynamics of the modes, but just connect the in and out ones. In order to test our methods, we generate the input data, i.e., the Monte-Carlo simulations of the model. The joint probability distribution of $N$ variables follows the Gibbs-Boltz distribution. In the rest of this section we implement the working equations for the techniques used. We want to show that $N’s are inhomogeneous with respect to phases. The generic Hamiltonian element will, therefore, rescale as   E^*_n J_{nm} E_m = J_nm} A_n A_m e^{\imath (\phi_n- \phi_m)    The XY model is written as the real-valued Hamiltonian, whose real- valued Hamiltonian is called the “XY’ model” and is called “Pseudolikelihood Maximization”. We will use this model in the next section of the paper. The underlying idea of PLM is that an approximation of the true parameters of the model is obtained for values that maximize the functions $L_i$. We will adopt an $l_2$ regularization so that the Pseudolikelihood function (PLF) at site $i$ reads: L_i = L-L-L. The standard implementation of the PLM consists in maximizing each $i=1\dots N$ separately. The expected values of the couplings are then: H_i^{(\mu) \cos( \phi_i (i) - \alpha_i (i) $ and $H_i^y ($i). The final estimate for $J_ij$ can be obtained by averaging the two results: J_ij(J) and J-J (J) The model is Hermitian, while the imaginary part is symmetric while the skew-mmetric part is skew-symmetric. It is useful to add a regularizer, which prevents the maximization routine to move towards high values of   $J_{ij}$ and $h_i$ without converging. For example, we can use the regularizer to ensure that $J-J$ is not too large, in order not to overcome $L-J. A new method, PLM + decimation, maximizes the sum of the $L_i$ sum. It recursively set to zero couplings which are estimated very small. A point is reached where the number of decimated couplings decreases abruptly. This indicates that relevant couplings are being decimated and under-fitting is taking place. In Fig. 1 we give an instance of this behavior for the 2D short-range XY model with ordered couplings. We stress that the maximum is obtained ignoring the underlying graph, and that the err$$ minimum can be evaluated once the true graph has been reconstructed. The peak of the model with $N64 spins coincides with the dip of the error of the reconstruction. We call this the ‘t tilted’ curve and the likelyhood is the reconstruction error vs. the reconstruction curve. For an ordered XY model on 2, J, on 2-valued spins, we call this ‘the real-valued curve’ and the tilted curve is the “real-valued” curve. The ‘true’ graph is the one with the $N(N-1)/2’ spins on it, and we call it ‘‘’’. The dynamics of the simulated model is based on the Metropolis algorithm and parallel tempering is used to speed up the thermalization of the system. The results here presented were obtained with bimodal distributed $J$s. The performances of the PLM have shown not to depend on $P(J)$. The results are plotted as a function of temperature (left column) and the number of samples (right column) for three values of $M$ and $T/J=0.7$ The results show that PLM appears to reconstruct the correct couplings, though zero couplings are always given a small inferred non-zero value. In particular, note that the infers half positive and half negative coupling, as expected, are shown as negative and half positive, respectively, for the same working temperature, for a given number and number of  samples. We can clearly see that $M=1024$ reproduces the expected step function, even though the jump is smeared, the difference between inferred couplings corresponding to the set of non- Zero couplings can be clearly appreciated, and to theSet of zero coupling can be also appreciated. The analysis of the results was carried out by the University of California, San Diego, using a computer simulation of a 2D lattice with periodic boundary conditions. The True Positive (TP) curve displays how many times the inference method finds a true link of the original network as a function of the index of the vector of sorted absolute value of reconstructed couplings. TP curves do not appear to be strongly influenced by the temperature. Results are plotted for three different temperatures, $T=0.4,1$ and $2.2, with increasing number of samples $M = 64, 128,512 and $1024$ (clockwise) The TP score improves as $M$ increases. This effect was observed also with mean-field inference techniques on the same model. For the couplings we have considered both ordered bimodal and ordered disordered cases. We have used the complex $XY$ model with $N=64$ spins at three different values of $T/J$ with increasing - clockwise from top - $M$. The TP curves are displayed for the ordered model (top) and the whole sorted couplings (bottom) for the real model (R-J) for $M=64, a single row of the real lattice $J, a row of $J-R, a column of $D-J, and a rows of $I-J-J$ for the complex model. Fig. 1 shows the tilted pseudolikelyhood for a 2D network with complex valued ordered couplings. As we can see, as $M$ increases, the maximum point of $L_t$ approaches $x^*$. The value of the most likely number of decimated couplings appears to be quite independent on $T$ with $M=2048$ number of samples. We can see that when a real coupling is small enough to be decimated its imaginary part is also decimated, and vice versa. The results refer to the ordered real-valued XY model we show in Fig. 1 for the real and imaginary couplings respectively. We see that both can be shown to have a minimum minimum number of zero couplings at $T=1.3$. The black line indicates the expected number of couplings, $x*=(N (N-1) - N c)/2=1888). We show the reconstruction errors for the full and complex valued couplings for the XY model in the figure in the bottom panel of Fig. 2. The dashed (green) and dotted (blue) lines show the Reconstruction errors (Eq.:errj) obtained for thereal and imaginary coupling matrices in the network. lued couplings. Top figures refer to a single site reconstruction, i.e., one row of the matrix $J$. Bottom figures report the couplings sorted in descending order. The temperature is here $T=0.7$ while the four graphs refer to different sample sizes: $M$ increases clockwise. The results refer to the case of ordered and real valued couplings, but similar behaviours were obtained for the other cases analysed. When $M=256$ the PLM techniques still reproduce the original network while the mean-field fails to find half of the coupling. The PLM with decimation is able to clearly infer the network of interaction even when $M =N=N+1. The network is clearly reconstructed only more than once with the decimation method. In comparison to the results shown in Sec. \ref{sec:res_reg, the PLm with decimating leads to rather cleaner results.  The results show that for all sample sizes and temperatures the reconstruction error is the same for all reconstruction methods. We compare the behaviour of the reconstruction methods with that of the mean field technique to see if they are equally effective at reconstructing the same network. We conclude that the network can be clearly inferred even when the network is under-sampling. The best performances are obtained by means of the  pseudo-likelihood method combined with decimation. This technique turns out to be very precise for problems whose underlying interaction network is sparse. The techniques displayed and the results obtained in this work can be of use in any of the many systems whose theoretical representation is given by Eq. \eqref{eq:HXY} or Eq:h_im. In particular, a possible application can be the field of light waves propagation through random media and the corresponding problem of the reconstruction of an object seen through an opaque medium or a disordered optical fiber. The behavior of the inference quality in temperature and in the size of data samples is also investigated, basically confirming the low $T$ behavior hinted by Nguyen and Berg for the Ising model."

Sunday School Notes
Preaching Method
January 17, 2016 Josh Vajda	Leave a comment
I’m not a preacher; I’m a theologian. But now that I’ve graduated seminary I sometimes have the honor of preaching. And as someone who just barely passed the two required preaching courses while he was focused on other things, I’ve had to go back and really develop a theology and strategy of preaching. It should go without saying that it’s a work in progress, but I’m at a place now where I’m comfortable with my system—which means the next step is to share it. Maybe someone out there can benefit from what I’ve learned, but either way there’s always room for improvement and maybe you can help me see where.
Topic/Text Selection
The first and most obvious question is what to preach on. I was trained to be sensitive to what the congregation needs to hear, but not being a pastor I don’t have that kind of insight. I once heard John Piper say when he’s a guest preacher he preaches to himself that way he knows at least one person needed it. I like that better, but this early in my ministry I’ve taken to something a little less holy: what can I preach well?
This has really driven most of my sermons to-date, especially because I usually have only a few weeks’ notice. I preached on Ahab because I had just read about him in my devotions. I preached on the tree and its fruits because I had just studied the passage in the context of LGBT acceptance. Most recently, I preached on 1 Corinthians because that’s what we’ve been studying in Sunday School. The more I know something ahead of time, the better chance I have of knowing what to look for and how to communicate it.
Once I have my topic, I start running the passage through a system in the three phases we used in seminary: exegetical, theological, and homiletical.
Phase 1: Exegetical
The exegetical phase is just getting into the passage itself. First, I want to know the immediate context for the passage. Why is this here? What ideas are continuing, and which are new? How the author frames the passage is probably the most important factor in choosing how I will introduce it in the sermon. If it’s an epistle, I will also play with a structural outline to try and identify rhetorical choices.
Second, I want to try and surface issues in the Greek. I do a very rough translation, and if a word jumps out at me I take note. I’m looking for ambiguous meanings, untranslated concepts, repeated words, related words, etc. I don’t expect to come up with a better translation than the professionals; I just want to have some idea of why they made the choices they did and what might be getting lost in translation. (Note: I don’t talk about Greek and Hebrew words from the pulpit; I only explain the concepts because that’s what I expect people to remember.)
Third, I take the list of questions I’ve been building and I start to do research. Who’s the referent in this verse? What does this metaphor mean? Is it used elsewhere? What’s the relationship between these two ideas? Does this command really imply that? My research is mostly based on Scripture alone, although there are times when I have to turn to historical background information to really get a reference. I see the Bible as one whole text even though it has many authors, and I’m very interested at drawing legitimate connections across books. I’ve also found Carson’s Exegetical Fallacies is a great help at avoiding common errors in biblical studies.
Phase 2: Theological
The boundary between exegesis and theology is thin and messy. I was given conflicting advice on this: some professors insisted I “bracket out” my theology, take nothing for granted; others insisted the only way to read it rightly is with Christian presuppositions.
I try to do both if I can.
Not all doctrines are equal. I refuse to bracket out core doctrines like the Trinity or salvation by grace alone through faith alone. But I feel very free to challenge other doctrines. My sense of how far to take which ideas is really very intuitive and not something that lends itself to explanation.
In short, the question raising and answering process is really the beginning of the theological phase for me. I’m looking for key ideas and trying to identify the timeless truths they communicate. Now there’s a danger here: you can use a passage to communicate all kinds of good theology. I think it’s much better when you can identify the theology the author was trying to communicate.
So one could hypothetically use Jesus’ tree/fruit analogy to talk about order in creation or a theology of arboreal imagery—and I might even do that in a teaching context. But preaching is a different task to me. I believe preaching is exhorting with the authoritative words of God. I’m not up there to educate. I’m there to press the points I believe God is pressing. If I teach anything else, it’s on my own authority. Hopefully it’s right. But if I’m going to say “thus saith the Lord,” I’d better be a sure as I can be that this is really His point; because again, not all doctrines are equal. So that’s why in this example I preached that the fruit of your life reveals the tree of your heart. I’m confident that was Jesus’ point, not mine.
Once I’m done with my exegetical studies, once I’ve done my best to figure everything out on my own—that’s when I turn to the commentaries. Just like with doing the translation, it’s not that I think I’m better than the experts; I do it because I know the text better when I wrestle with it myself. What’s more, as I wrestle with it I get a better sense of where others may have trouble, so I know to explain them more carefully or illustrate them more vividly. The only reason I even open the commentaries is for validation: did I miss anything or draw a wrong conclusion.
Phase 3: Homiletical
Throughout the whole process thus far, I’m keeping my eyes open for anything interesting, catchy, or eloquent. In some ways I’m having a conversation with the text and cross-references, and I note the parts of the conversation I like. If a crucial idea jumps out, I want to note it so I can craft a phrase around it. If an idea gets me really excited, I’ll jump out of my seat and pretend I’m preaching on it right then and there. Often those bursts of inspiration have gems worth polishing. Hopefully by the end of the exegetical process and the theological Q&A, I have a list of ideas and phrases to sprinkle in as I actually write the sermon.
One unfair advantage here is I took a course in copy writing, which is basically script for advertising. I especially liked what my professor called “fulcrum phrases,” like M&M’s famous “melts in your mouth / not in your hand.” It’s a skill I’ve tried to hone in my songwriting. If you can find that well-crafted phrase that has symmetry, it connects deeper and sticks better. I try to make sure I find at least one for every sermon. Here are some I’ve used:
It’s not yours to take; it’s God’s to give.
He who walks in humility walks in grace.
The fruit of your life reveals the tree of your heart.
You don’t have to hold on to anything for God to hold on to you.
So that’s my ideal, but I’m looking for anything at all that excites me, because if I’m excited about something there’s a good chance someone else will be, too.
Sermon Structure
At this point, I’m ready to start writing my sermon. I know what the text is about, why it exists, how it relates to the rest of Scripture, which parts are difficult to understand, and which parts are exciting. But before I can build content, I need a skeleton.
At Dallas Seminary I learned that a good introduction has the same essential parts, and I use the acronym INSTeP to remember them: image, need, subject, text, and preview. As someone with some creative writing background, I didn’t like this at first. But truth be told, a good sermon borrows from both storytelling and essay. The story draws you in, but the essay keeps you grounded. And just like a good essay, you need a thesis statement and its essential supports to help prepare people for what’s to come.
In my mind, the most important aspect of the introduction is the boring stuff: what’s the subject, what problem does it solve, where is our passage, and what are the main points. The image serves that. As a student I wanted to pick a great image that really stood out and captured people’s attention. But right now I’m in a place where all I care about is getting people interested in the need. If I have an image that raises the need, great; if not, I’ll try to explain my way to it. If you get through the introduction and people still don’t know what you’re talking about or why they should care, you’re about to fight an uphill battle.
The preaching style taught at Dallas and many other evangelical schools is sometimes called “Big Idea” preaching. The short version is that every sermon should have a well-crafted thesis statement. The way it’s taught, it’s everything; your exegesis is all about finding it, your homiletics are all about driving it home. In some cases the thesis becomes more important than the passage itself, which I think is going too far.
But I do think there should be one main idea tying everything together. It shouldn’t replace the passage, but it should drive the passage. As I go through my study process I’m making a list of possible thesis statements. If I haven’t found it by the end of the study process, I keep working toward it. There’s no point in writing the sermon until I have that unifying thought because I’m interested in every detail, every rabbit trail. I need that thesis to give my writing purpose, to tell me what to cut and what to emphasize.
Once I have the thesis, I try to take the existing structure of the passage and relate it back to that thesis. I know there are many different structures you can play with, but I find I do a better job of preaching the passage when I follow its structural cues. When I try to write a novel structure, I tend to make the passage just a series of illustrations for my own points; I’m sure better preachers are skilled at avoiding this problem.
Once I have the thesis and the structure, I write a draft of the whole sermon, weaving in those phrases I had stored up.
Somehow application seems to be the most contentious part of the sermon. Some preachers try to draw out every possible implication while others see application as purely the Holy Spirit’s job and provide nothing. While there are many possible applications, I try to find one that the text emphasizes more than the others and make that the whole deal. So while I really wanted to say something in my last sermon about how we should love unconditionally just as God does, that wasn’t Paul’s application. It’s true and we should do it, but Paul’s application trumps mine because it’s his passage. So I talked about boasting in the Lord.
Once I have my application, I take it in two directions—and I consider this my own secret sauce. I’m sure I’m not the first person to think of it, but I didn’t hear it anywhere else. My professor always told us “give them something to do!” In fact, he would say to give them something concrete to do that very day to maximize the chances that they will actually apply the sermon. I love it! It takes no time at all to forget a sermon.
But then I discovered there are some who take issue with this entire method of application, among them one of my favorite preachers, Tim Keller. For them, giving people something to do inspires legalism, and that endangers the Gospel. Instead they strive to show how Jesus already fulfilled the command of this passage, and the application is just to believe in Him, to adore Him, to marvel at Him. I love this, too! I absolutely believe that every passage properly understood relates to Christ in some way, and every application can be used to point to His perfect example and finished work.
So I try to do both. And here’s why: both are true. Christ has given us new life and yet we are called to live out a new life. The work is done in one sense, and yet we labor in another. So I always begin with showing how Christ has perfectly applied the passage and inviting people to believe in Him and rest in His finished work. Then because of what Christ has done, I call us to imitate Him by applying it ourselves.
At this point all I have to show for my labor is a rough draft. In order to make it presentable, I have a few more steps I go through, and these typically take me a week all by themselves. My goal is to make the sermon sound as natural and engaging as possible.
First, I read the sermon out loud and mark anything that doesn’t sound like me. Maybe I was copying someone’s tone, or more likely my tone was too formal or too informal for the moment. I also italicize the words I want to emphasize. It’s all about the sound.
Second, I memorize the sermon. (Yes, the whole thing.) This is what they trained us to do in seminary, and I thought it was overkill. Yes, you can get better eye contact, step away from the podium, I get that. But what I’ve discovered is that when I memorize my work it polishes the sermon like nothing else. If I can’t remember what I’m about to say, how can I expect the congregation to remember? Memorizing forces me to find the best words for the job.
It also helps me on a structural level, because if I can’t remember what I was about to say next, it shows that there’s a weak connection between the two points. In a compelling script, the next thing has to follow the last. Once you know why the two are married, you can go back and make it more obvious to the congregation.
As I memorize, I boil down the transcript into a preaching outline, which has just enough structure and content to cue me if my mind goes blank in the pulpit. It will have the necessary structural elements, markers for key phrases, and all condensed so that it fits on just a few pages on the platform. (One danger is if I don’t use it in practice, it’s less helpful on Sunday.)
Third—and frankly this is the step I’m most likely to skip—I try to choreograph my movements. I believe good preaching is theater, but not in the sense that you’re dramatizing the text. Your whole body is communicating whether you want it to or not, so your gestures should be purposeful. Use the space to organize thoughts, repeat certain motions when you repeat the same thought, make sure you’re not sending mixed signals. Usually I run out of time before I get here, so I have plenty of room to grow in this area.
As I reflect on my process I realize that it’s uniquely tailored to me. My background as a writer, my love for theology, and my unique skills all lead me to emphasize different things. For someone with a different background and skill set this might be like trying on another man’s armor. How can you leverage who you are to preach better?
Of course, I didn’t do this from scratch; I was given a great model in seminary and have observed some great preachers thanks to modern technology. The key for me is molding this process to fit my unique mix of strengths and weaknesses, and that’s sure to be a never-ending project.
Annual Meeting in Review: ETS 2015
November 22, 2015 Josh Vajda	2 Comments
Last week I made my usual pilgrimage to the place where all the evangelical seminary geeks converge: the Annual Meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society. This year was the second time Atlanta has hosted since I began attending, and it was fun reliving early autumn just before the snow arrived back home.
Over the years I developed a strategy: make plans to attend nonstop papers, then throw out those plans when relational opportunities arise. This year the program was a bit light, but thankfully the people made up for what was lacking.
When reflecting on the meeting I was reminded of just how good last year’s meeting had been. This year had none of the same “aha!” moments, but I did enjoy many rich times of reflection after various papers.
As is my usual habit, I attended a number of friend’s papers (e.g., Ford on Ignatius, Roeber on historiography, Svigel on the Didache). But then I also stalked a few of the theologians I’ve come to admire in recent years: Al Mohler, Carl Trueman, and Anthony Bradley. Of course the problem there is that once you begin following someone you have the ever-increasing experience of anticipating what they are going to say on a given subject. This is especially true of Mohler, whose two podcasts have been my intellectual lifeline this year in times when babies and house projects and service commitments have prevented deeper study.
Analytic Theology
What came as an outright disappointment was the afternoon I spent in the Analytic Theology section. For those of you who don’t know, “analytic theology” is a recent movement to apply the tools of analytic philosophy to the questions of theology. I’ve been thrilled about this from the moment I heard of it, but what I saw really didn’t reflect what I think the movement is capable of. The thinking seemed lackluster and the questions unhelpful. Crisp and especially Rae were there asking insightful questions, but I think being overly kind to the presenters. I suppose you can’t be too inhospitable if you want guests to come back next year.
Avoiding the Marriage-and-Family Theme
The theme this year was “Marriage and Family” but it’s clear the real interest was continued discussion of how to deal with LGBT-related doctrines. In the past year I’ve read numerous books, taught two classes, and delivered a regional paper on the subject. That was enough for me. Maybe there were some missed opportunities here, but I’m ok with that.
Reflection on 2015
One of the things I’ve been forced to do each year—and rightly so, I think—is to reevaluate my purpose and progress in the intellectual community. This occupied much of my reflection in private, some with friends, and significant portions of the drive time from Michigan.
Here are a few conclusions I reached:
Even though I can’t justify a doctorate for my career, I am coming to the conviction that I can justify one for ministry. It may even be something I must do.
Even though I have the tools for self-study, I can accomplish much more with a cohort of like-minded individuals. I need to find a group of theologians I can run with or I will fall behind.
Even though I feel as though I’ve hardly studied this past year, (I recall reading only two theology books!), I’m reminded that I’ve still accomplished quite a bit with my LGBT studies, weekly Sunday School prep, church doctrinal formulations, and ministry strategizing. It’s different work, but I haven’t been as lazy as I feared.
Even though I have been working to be useful to our local church congregation and open to correction about my academic bent, the fact remains that right beliefs are a crucial part of our walk with Christ. Theology matters.
I used to journal incessantly, but have cut back quite a bit this year to focus on getting stuff done. All that to say the time was ripe for some reflection.
Lately I’ve referred to my calling as a “ministry of ideas.” As I chart a course for 2016, the question of what that ministry looks like looms large. The plans are still up in the air, but my time in Atlanta this year has been enormously helpful in the process.
See you next year in good old San Antonio, TX!
Sanctify Us with the Truth
July 9, 2015 Josh Vajda	Leave a comment
I’ve been a big fan of the Bible all my life. As a child I was amazed by the miracles God did. As I got older it was His character that captivated me. These days I’m intrigued by His wisdom. I want to know how He thinks, what He’s planning, how to make sense of His creation. The Bible is at the center of my relationship with God, and it always has been.
But the Bible isn’t God, and the Bible isn’t the whole of my relationship with God. So why is it that I always come back here? I believe that God reveals Himself in Creation and in the Church; I believe I have His Holy Spirit. So why does my relationship with Him keep coming back to a book?
One passage that gives us some clues is John 13–17—known as the Upper Room Discourse. It’s Jesus’ last teaching time with His disciples before He goes to the cross. It’s a time of transition.
Up until now, having a personal relationship with God was as easy as ever. You just spend time with Jesus—the Jewish guy. You want to talk to God? Just go find Jesus. You want an answer from God? Ask Jesus a question. You need divine intervention? Call Jesus for help.
In fact, not only is Jesus God in the flesh as the second person of the Trinity, but we see that He also manifests the Father and is indwelt by the Spirit. This goes beyond the perfect unity of the Trinity: all three persons are present in unique ways.
But in the Upper Room, Jesus is about to leave. He won’t be there to answer questions, to heal the sick, to right the wrong. And if He’s gone, so is the manifestation of the Father, and so is the Holy Spirit within Him.
So what does a personal relationship with God look like when God leaves the building?
First and most importantly, God hasn’t really left. Even though God incarnate has ascended into heaven, He did not leave us alone. The Holy Spirit is God’s special presence in this age.
“And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.” (John 14:16, 17 ESV)
The same Spirit that indwells Jesus will indwell His disciples, and if we skip ahead to Acts, we can see that this Spirit of Truth indwells all believers. He is described as a Helper—which should come as no surprise from the God who just washed His disciples’ feet. And at least one aspect of His ministry is to point back to Christ.
“But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me.” (John 15:26 ESV)
But it’s not as though the Spirit is a consolation prize. Even though His ministry is all about Christ, Jesus seems to say the Spirit’s ministry will be better than His!—at least for the next phase of God’s plan.
“Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged. I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.” (John 16:7–15 ESV)
There’s a lot to unpack here, but first I just want you to notice: when we lost the Savior, we gained the Helper, and He’s exactly what we needed next. Even though Jesus fully paid for our sins, we need a Helper to teach us the perfect obedience that Jesus modeled, to realize the change that Jesus purchased for us.
Now we get a fuller picture of what the Spirit of Truth has come to do. To the unbelieving world, He is a source of conviction, confronting sinners with the reality of who Jesus really was and what He did. To believers, He is a source of wisdom and knowledge.
This is a ministry of words and truth. We usually call Him the Holy Spirit, which rightly emphasizes His character and the work that He does in our hearts, but He is also called the Spirit of Truth. He draws us back to the words Jesus spoke, which bear the Father’s authority.
The Sanctifying Word
These days we’ve become cautious about putting our trust in words or staking claim to truth. We’re allowed to have our own truth, and we’re expected to have our own interpretations. But to go beyond this is to invite conflict.
Some of us have also grown weary of knowledge because we’ve seen people devote themselves to a dead orthodoxy that devours truth and then does nothing with it. So we associate the Christian walk with a ministry of love and compassion and holiness—which it is—and try not to get too distracted by the rest.
But it’s clear that Jesus spent a good deal of time ministering in words and teaching truth, and that the Holy Spirit is also committed to a ministry of words and truth.
“Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father’s who sent me. These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you. But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.” (John 14:24–26 ESV)
When Jesus prays, He even emphasizes this before the Father:
“Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you. For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me.” (John 17:7, 8 ESV)
It’s a precious thing to have the words of God. They came from the Father, through the Son, and by the Spirit. These words have been compiled in Scripture—the Bible—and it’s not God’s leftovers. At the heart of the Trinity’s ministry is a message. When we put our faith in Christ, we confess and believe specific realities.
“I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.” (John 17:14 ESV)
But this word is not some passive collection of propositions to be absorbed. Just as the Holy Spirit is also the Spirit of Truth, so the true words and message of Scripture are given to make us holy.
“Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.” (John 17:17–19 ESV)
This truth has a purpose. God’s message—the words of the Father—they are to make us holy. They are to wash us and set us apart. We are to be purified by this message, and at the heart of these instructions is love.
“If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full. This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.” (John 15:10–12 ESV)
God has not left us alone. We have the Holy Spirit of Truth, and we also have the words of the Father.
I think this must be what Jesus alluded to in John 4, when He told the Samaritan woman at the well about those who would worship in spirit and in truth. Jesus clearly leaves us here with His Spirit and His truth. These are the twin lights guiding us on our pilgrimage. These are the two ways God is present with us today. Even though He is not with us physically, He is with us personally, spiritually, and verbally.
Truth is good for its own sake, and sanctification is, too. But we must not forget that our relationship with God as Spirit and through the Word draws those two things together. We pursue truth in order to be sanctified. We are sanctified by the truth.
When we talk about how we relate to God, our first thought is often the Cross, and that’s not wrong. Without Jesus’ work on the Cross we could have no fellowship with God. But even though it is what made a relationship with God possible, our relationship with Him goes much deeper. God is specially present in the world today by His Holy Spirit, Who indwells each and every believer. And the words of the Father have come by the Son and the Spirit to us in the form of the Bible. It is the Holy Spirit of Truth together with the Holy Words of God that mark God’s presence in our lives. They are what guide us and sanctify us.
This is why we can’t get away from Scripture. This is why our relationship with God depends so much on our relationship with this book. Creation reveals God by what He has done, but it does not offer His words to us. The Church is united and empowered by the Spirit of God, but it cannot speak His words either. The Bible is how the Holy Spirit speaks to us; it is one of the means by which God has chosen to sanctify His people. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.
The Story of Death (2/15/15)

Introduction: The Matter of Life and Death
A friend once told me that Christianity is a “culture of death.” This was of course a reversal of Pope John Paul II’s 1995 condemnation of the modern culture of death, which sees the weak as useless at best—a burden to be eliminated. He pointed to the crucifixion, the Old Testament sacrificial system, and the way we seem to look forward to death so that we can go to heaven.
In a strange sense my friend was right: Christianity has a lot to say about death, and sacrifice is central to our theology. Of course, in context Christianity is anything but a culture of death, but if we’re not careful we can definitely sound the way my friend described us. We sometimes get confused about the role death plays in God’s plan.
So today we examine what the Bible says about death and reconsider what role it plays in our lives.
It’s interesting: there’s a way in which you could read the Bible as a book about death. That’s obviously not all it talks about, but the “story arc” of death spans the entire book.
Let’s take a stroll, shall we?
The first mention of death is in the second chapter of the Bible: “in the day you eat of [the forbidden fruit] you will surely die” (Genesis 2:17). This promise was the center of the debate between the woman and the serpent in Genesis 3, and they ate of the fruit. But they didn’t die. God was gracious not to put them to death physically, but there is a kind of spiritual death that took place then. Since the Fall, mankind has been unresponsive to God.
But make no mistake, physical death was coming. We know from Romans that death entered through Adam’s sin—it wasn’t part of the original created order. And as proof, we see in Adam’s genealogy the reign of death: each one dies. We read “and he died” over and over here. Romans 3:23 tells us “the wages of sin is death.” All sinned, so all die. Death had become a part of life.
But Genesis is just getting warmed up! Because next comes the Flood where—you guessed it—everybody dies. Then the Patriarchs die. Then the book ends with the death of Joseph. Who ends a book that way?!? This is not a happy ending.
But then there’s Exodus, where the Egyptians die, Leviticus where animals die, Numbers where unbelieving Israel dies, Joshua where the Canaanites die. Death is everywhere! It’s all over the Pentateuch.
Why would this be? Because death is the punishment for sin. All crimes against God are capital offenses. That doesn’t mean He immediately smites everyone the moment they sin—but technically speaking, He could. That would be just. And if it doesn’t feel just then maybe we don’t understand sin as well as we thought we did.
In Ezekiel, God tells us He gets no pleasure from the death of the wicked. Does this surprise you? He would much rather see the wicked turn from their ways—to repent and live. But those who will not get what they deserve.
Sometimes if we’re not careful this is a way that we distort God’s character, as though God somehow hungers for death and blood. God isn’t pleased by animal sacrifice, but He requires some recompense for sin. God didn’t send the Flood on a whim but because evil on the earth had become unbearable. If we take death out of the context of grace and patience and kindness, we get a very wrong view of God.
But because death is part of life in a fallen world, we sometimes get confused about our relationship with death on the one hand and God’s sovereignty on the other. The author of Ecclesiastes notes that people are just as dead as animals in the end. The wise man for all of his wisdom still ends up just as dead as the fool. The nice thing about being dead is you don’t have to live in fear of death anymore! It’s a bleak way to look at things, but not wrong. What’s the point of life if the only thing we can be sure of is death?
If this is getting depressing, good! Sin is serious business and so is death. Christianity has a lot to say about death because it takes sin seriously.
But there’s a whole lot left to be said.
It turns out contrary to popular belief, death can be undone. Yes, you heard me: the end might not really be the end after all. Elijah and Elisha are both able to raise the dead. Jesus raises the dead. Jesus’ disciples raise the dead. Of course, these were all temporary. But it’s a start!
God promises us that it gets better than this. In Isaiah 25, He promises to swallow up death forever. How is this possible?!? The wages of sin is death. A holy God can’t just get rid of death.
He’d have to get rid of sin somehow.
This is where everything gets turned on its head. This is that part in the movie where you fly through the black hole and end up in a different dimension, or where Alice jumps down the rabbit hole. God swallows up death by letting death swallow Him up. Jesus, being fully God, lives a perfectly sinless life—a life not meriting death—and dies on our behalf, paying for all the sin of the world.
Let that sink in for a moment: God dies. But the death of God becomes the death of sin, and the death of sin becomes the death of death. And death’s final defeat is announced through the resurrection of God back from the dead. The God of life is alive! And He offers eternal life to all.
As Tim Keller likes to put it, Jesus died the death we deserved so that we could live the life He deserved. Because Jesus submitted to death on our behalf, our relationship with death gets really complicated. It’s still the enemy. It’s still the wages of sin. It’s still not good. But every good thing—salvation, resurrection, eternal life, peace with God—these all came from one great death: the Crucifixion.
So now all death is bad, but that one death brought us everything good. We praise the God of life, but we celebrate His death. God took a horrible, terrible, rotten, no-good thing and redeemed it.
I suppose that shouldn’t surprise us either.
We may sometimes look like we’re rejoicing in death itself, but really we rejoice in that one death that God used to bring eternal life. Our problem isn’t that we sing about death too much—we probably don’t sing about it enough! But we have to keep it in the context of the bigger story. We can’t make any sense of the Crucifixion apart from the Fall, the Resurrection, and Return of Christ.
This is the theme we see in the Book of Acts: God raised Jesus from the dead. It’s all about resurrection now! We baptize in the likeness of His death—and resurrection. We take the bread and cup to remember His death—all the while waiting for His return.
In Romans, death takes on a whole new meaning: since our sins were buried with Christ, we are now alive to God and dead to sin. Spiritual death is over now. Death has become just a metaphor for our relationship with sin.
But make no mistake, death didn’t just die spiritually. We might think that because we still see death all around us. Christians still die. But at the very end of the Bible we see that when Christ returns, death will finally be thrown into the lake of fire and be no more. All the dead will come to life—but this time never to die again.
I can’t help but think of John Donne’s Holy Sonnet X: Death Be Not Proud:
Death, be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;
For those whom thou thinkst thou dost overthrow
From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be
Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow
And soonest our best men with thee do go
Rest of their bones and soul’s delivery.
And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,
And poppies or charms can make us sleep as well
And better than thy stroke. Why swellst thou then?
And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die!
Today we sit knowing that we are no longer spiritually dead, and instead we are dead to sin. Christ has risen from the dead, but He has not yet returned. Physical death is still a reality. It’s still cruel. But it’s not the end.
I have another friend, a learned scholar who is emphatic about how much he hates death. He doesn’t want to die. Yet Paul almost seems to disagree. In Philippians he writes, “To live is Christ and to die is gain.” Is death gain? Is there something good about death—our deaths? Is my death-hating friend overreacting?
Insofar as my friend is only talking about death, he’s right. You can’t really hate death enough. And our hope is in the resurrection, when we get our new bodies and live with Christ forever. Paul’s not saying that death isn’t really so bad after all. He’s saying Christ means so much to him that he would even suffer death to be with Him. It’s not that death is lesser; it’s that Jesus is greater.
This is how we make sense of Paul’s taunt in 1 Corinthians 15, which talks at length about the resurrection: “Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?” Ultimately he’s talking about the end of death when we are raised, but there’s a sense in which death’s sting is tempered by the sweetness of life with Jesus.
When we lose a loved one, it’s hard. If he or she is a believer, we’re comforted by the fact that even though they died they enjoy the sweetness of Christ’s presence. Don’t let anyone take that away from you. Just don’t forget: that’s not the end of the story. It gets better!
They won’t stay dead.
Who is this God who can even bring good out of death?
Today is Ash Wednesday. Many Christians will receive ash on their foreheads and be reminded, “You are dust, and to dust you will return.” Not a message we particularly like to hear. We often think of ourselves as souls who just happen to be in bodies, that our parts are interchangeable—maybe even expendable. But these words are the words God Himself spoke to Adam after the Fall. You are dust. A sobering thought. Our bodies are a part of us, and our reflection is a daily reminder that we’re not as strong as we think we are.
That’s not the whole truth about us, but it’s a part we can’t afford to forget. Considering our frailty and our mortality shouldn’t lead to despair; it should bring us to our knees before our Savior. We confess how much we need Him, and how grateful we are that we have Him. Recognizing our insufficiency is just one way we deepen our appreciation for all we have in Christ. We humble ourselves not to make Him greater but because He is greater! He has brought us forgiveness and eternal life, sent us His Spirit. If we were left to our own devices, we would have no hope. But because of His love, rich in mercy, we have this gift from God.

The Unfolding of the Fall
Fractured Relationships
Total Depravity—but not Extreme Depravity
Comparing Theories [new! not discussed in class]
So What Do We Do Until Then?
Bonus Thoughts
We all know the story of the Fall from Genesis 3. Perfect woman with perfect husband in perfect garden meets talking snake. He tempts her to disobey God and eat the forbidden fruit, then she hands some to her husband who does the same. God comes and gives them a spanking and sends them out of the garden.
Ok, so the details might be a little off… maybe even a little forgettable. But the story is familiar and the consequences tragic. We live in those consequences. So what does this story have to tell us about the world today and our lives in it?
You can learn a lot about sin and humanity by really chewing on the details here. Consider:
The serpent (we’re later told it’s also Satan) begins with questioning what God has said.
The question overgeneralizes and invites a conversation.
The woman adds to God’s commandment.
The serpent challenges God and offers a desirable half-truth.
The woman (although perfect) is tempted. That temptation draws her to inspect the fruit.
Looking at the fruit, the woman focused on the positive side of the equation.
She risked her life trusting the serpent over God, because eating the fruit should have meant certain death.
The man ate without any signs of a struggle.
Their eyes were open. Before they knew only the good; now they knew good and evil.
Their first response to sin is to cover up, which indicates fear and probably shame.
Their response to God (their creator whom they knew personally!) was to hide. Apparently they either didn’t know or forgot that God is everywhere and knows everything.
God asks the man a question for effect.
The man blames his wife and even seems to accuse God.
The woman blames the serpent and even seems to deflect by saying she was tricked.
At this point God punishes the serpent, the man, and the woman by cursing all creation. Work will be hard, childbearing will be painful. But there is hope in the promise of One to come who will crush the serpent.
I love how the Good News glimmers even in that first dark moment.
It’s so tempting to read more into the story because there are so many more details we wish we had. The gaps in the story invite our imaginations to jump in, but we need to be careful not to put words in God’s mouth.
One theme we see in the Fall is one broken relationship after another. We noted last week how we were created to need one another and how that’s a good thing. But after the Fall we see husband and wife blaming each other. Worse yet, we see them hiding from God. After creation is cursed there’s really nothing left: man’s relationships with God, with others, with creation, and even with himself are all broken. And so our need for each other grows even greater, but our incapacity to find what we need and be who we need to be for others makes meeting this need impossible.
But let’s be honest here: the biggest problem is this broken relationship with God. He is their Creator and Sustainer. He knows them personally, guides them, and has given them all they need. What’s more, He’s perfectly good. This fall into sin was an act of rebellion against a God who had been nothing but loving and giving. Everything depends on Him.
Is it any wonder He warned them they would die?
Now the astute reader will note they didn’t drop dead. Does this mean the serpent was right? Not hardly! This broken relationship with God is sometimes thought of a “spiritual death,” a state of unresponsiveness to God. I’m generally fine with this idea—after all, they certainly became separated from God! What else could you call a state apart from the God of life? Death makes sense.
But we know that this is where physical death enters the picture. Mankind wasn’t supposed to die. YOU right now reading this: you were never supposed to die. Now we tend to say death is a part of life. It wasn’t supposed to be that way. Death was never a part of life. Death is a reality we have to live with, but it’s not good.
So I think spiritual death metaphorically happened, but physical death literally happened. And the only reason they walked out of that garden alive has to have been God’s grace and mercy.
Another observation we can make is that Adam and Eve weren’t immediately as bad as they could have been. This is sometimes what we think when we talk about “total depravity.” If you want a really bleak picture you have to turn ahead a few pages to the state of the world before the Flood. It took a long time to get there.
No, extreme depravity wasn’t the result of the Fall, but total depravity still is. Total depravity is the doctrine that says sin bent every part of man. Sin pollutes man’s reason, man’s emotions, man’s willpower, man’s desires, man’s imagination, man’s memories, man’s senses, man’s body, and even man’s conscience. Nothing is safe. Nothing is pure.
And this is intimately wrapped up in the image of God. Remember that man was made in God’s image, unique among all creation. But sin now pollutes that image. It’s still present—we still can’t help but “image” our Creator when we act rationally, make wise decisions, love others selflessly, and so on. Instead the image is defaced but not erased. What should normally reflect God’s character instead reflects a mixture of good and evil.
Comparing Theories
Now if we take a step back, we all recognize that we live in a broken world. Very few people would argue that everything is perfect, that sin, suffering, and death somehow don’t exist or aren’t really bad. We (generally) all agree that there’s a problem. But there’s little agreement about why it is the way it is.
People who don’t believe in a literal Adam and Even tanking the human race are generally stuck. For example, if you only believe in the natural world, evil is just a part of nature. Death is a part of life. Suffering is a biochemical response to destructive conditions. And if you’re just one organism out of millions competing for resources, all you can really say is that you don’t like these things. They are distasteful. Maybe you’re hard-wired to show empathy with others because of some evolutionary imperative, but objectively speaking what can you say?
Well, you can say lots I suppose, but you can’t be consistent without ending up a nihilist.
Other religions have the same problem: either evil belongs as some part of the bigger cosmic plan or it’s an illusion. Either way, it’s hard to take evil seriously. Either it belongs in some way, or it doesn’t exist at all. Either way it’s hard to justify our natural reactions to injustice, suffering, and death.
But let’s forget about consistency and get to work: what problems can we name and how do we fix them?
If the problem is society, the cure is social change.
If the problem is pride, the cure is humility.
If the problem is bad decisions, the cure is right decisions.
If the problem is lack of love, the cure is love.
If the problem is a broken relationship, the cure is forgiveness.
If the problem is rebellion, the cure is submission.
If the problem is demons, the cure is their destruction.
If the problem is illusion, the cure is truth.
If the problem is original sin, the cure is death of the old self.
If the problem is doubt, the cure is faith.
If the problem is in every part of us, the cure is a new creation.
If the problem is death, the cure is eternal life.
Of course this just scratches the surface. But what I want you to notice is that for all of these problems, Christianity offers the solution. And for all of these problems, the solution is the same: that one seed of woman that God promised, the One to come that would crush the serpent. His name is Jesus.
Some of these things were addressed in His first coming, when He died on the cross for our sins and rose to life to offer us eternal life. But the work isn’t done yet. He’s coming back to finish the work, to make all things new. Think about that. We’ll explain further another time.
As a wise poet named Tom once wrote, the waiting is the hardest part. If we as Christians are a new creation (we are), have eternal life (we do), are filled with the Holy Spirit (yup), and are no longer slaves to sin (seriously!), then why is the world still messed up? And more to the point, why are WE still messed up?
Frankly, we still suffer the effects of sin in all our faculties. Our wills have been freed from slavery, but they’re still polluted. We won’t be fully free from the effects of sin until Jesus comes back.
So we’re no longer slaves, but we’re still polluted and live in a polluted world. We have the Holy Spirit, but we still choose to disobey. In theory you should be able to live a perfect life after you’re saved, but because we’ve already been marked by sin in our lives and live in an imperfect world, we will never be perfect under our own power.
What do we do then? Give up? Of course not! We beat our bodies into submission. We learn right and wrong from Scripture, and we challenge our motives day to day.
But if we want to go the extra mile, we can’t do it alone.
There will be times you trick yourself into thinking you’re doing what’s right. There will be times you misread Scripture and misunderstand what God expects. And to guard against those times you need to surround yourself with fellow believers. You need people who know you, who know the Word, and who are committed to following Jesus with you. They can provide that outside check to make sure sin isn’t getting the best of you.
Because let’s face it: some days it’s hard to tell the difference between the Holy Spirit’s promptings and our own desires. Nothing can do better to counter that than other Spirit-filled people who bring a different perspective.
We ended up talking a lot about sanctification today, but that’s because it’s how we cope with the effects of the Fall in our lives. I don’t ever want to teach about sin and suffering and death without also pointing to the hope we have in Christ! The sin we as Christians struggle with is our bad choices day to day. If you’re saved, all you can do is persevere in what’s right and help others to do the same. We’ll say more about suffering and death another time.
My challenge to you is this: who do you have in your life who can give you that outside angle to your struggles and decisions? Where can you go to make sure you’re on the right path? If you’re not sure, start looking!
We need each other more than ever.
Isn’t it interesting how hard it is to remember the details of a story we’ve heard dozens of times? Our memories aren’t perfect. It sure helps having other people to lean on…
Historically speaking, the discussion of the effects of the Fall gets really fun with Augustine and Pelagius. In a nutshell, Augustine argued that we are always in need of God’s grace, but Pelagius believed we didn’t suffer from original sin and could become perfect if we try hard enough.
Regarding different relationships with sin, Augustine put it this way: God is not able to sin, Adam was created able not to sin, the Fall left us not able not to sin, and those in Christ are back where created Adam was: able not to sin.

a blog about theology and everything else","['The three phases are exegetical, theological, and homiletical.']",9437,multifieldqa_en,en,,46a2207a7a3f6d98effa73491cf83b63f92e29e0023c6e52," Josh Vajda has developed a theology and strategy of preaching. He uses the three phases we used in seminary: exegetical, theological, and homiletical. The boundary between exegesis and theology is thin and messy, he says. He says he tries to take nothing for granted, even if it's the only way to take Christian presuppositions for granted. He also says he doesn’t expect to come up with a better translation of the Bible than the professionals. The more I know something ahead of time, the better chance I have of knowing what to look for and how to communicate it. It’s a work in progress, but I’m at a place now where I'm comfortable with my system—which means the next step is to share it with the world. He hopes someone out there can benefit from what he’ve learned, but either way there’�s always room for improvement and maybe you can help me see where. I feel like I ve ve ve by grace alone through faith alone, and I want to help you see where that might be. I hope you’ll join me. After studying the Bible, the author looks for key ideas and tries to identify the timeless truths they communicate. After the exegetical process and the theological Q&A, he has a list of ideas and phrases to sprinkle in as he actually writes the sermon. At Dallas Seminary, he learned that a good introduction has the same essential parts and I use the acronym INSTPP to remember them: image, need, subject, text, and preview. As someone with creative writing background, I didn’t like this first, but now I’m used to it. I think it’s much better when you can identify the theology the author was trying to communicate. My sense of how far to take which ideas is really very intuitive and not something that lends itself to explanation. I believe preaching is exhorting with the authoritative words of God. I'm there to press the points I believe God is pressing. If I teach anything else, it's on my own authority. If an idea gets me really excited, I'll jump out of my seat and pretend I'm preaching on it right then and there. Often those bursts of inspiration have gems worth polishing. I try to make sure I find at least one for every sermon. Here are some I�’ve used: He who walks in humility walks in grace. The preaching style taught at Dallas and many other evangelical schools is sometimes called “Big Idea” preaching. The short version is that every sermon should have a well-crafted thesis statement. Some preachers try to draw out every possible implication while others see application as purely the Holy Spirit’s job and provide nothing. For them, giving people something to do inspires legalism, and that endangers the Gospel, he says. The application is to believe in Him, to marvel at Him, too! I believe that every passage properly understood relates to Christ in some way, and every can be used to point to His perfect example and finished work. And here's why I try to do both: Every time I finish a sermon, I think of Christ and his perfect example of what it means to be a son of God. I love it! It takes no time at all to forget a sermon. It takes a long time to forget the application of a sermon as well as the structure of it. But I’m sure better preachers are skilled at avoiding this problem. I know there are many different structures you can play with. I find I do a better job of preaching the passage when I follow its structural cues. ""I always begin with showing how Christ has perfectly applied the passage and inviting people to believe in Him"" ""My goal is to make the sermon sound as natural and engaging as possible"" ""If I can’t remember what I’m about to say, how can I expect the congregation to remember?"" ""I try to choreograph my movements. I believe good preaching is theater, but not in the sense that you’re dramatizing the text. It’s all about the body"" ""I’ve never been able to find a sermon that I like more than the one I give."" ""It’ll be a long time before I can do this again."" ""I don't think I'll ever be able to do it again, but I'm getting better at it"" ""It's a great way to start a sermon, but it's not the end of the world."" ""If you're going to be a preacher, you've got to have a way to get people to listen to you. You can't just say, 'I'm going to talk to you about the Bible' "" ""I'm not sure I've ever found a sermon I love more than this one."" ""When I'm preaching, I don't just talk to people. I have to make them listen."" Josh Vajda is a senior pastor in San Antonio, Texas. He has been reflecting on his life and ministry in the past year. He says he feels he can justify a doctorate for ministry. He also says he needs to find a group of theologians he can run with or he will fall behind. Vajda: ""Theology matters. The Bible is at the center of my relationship with God"" He says his time in Atlanta this year has been enormously helpful in the process of reevaluating his purpose and progress in the intellectual community. ""I’ve been a big fan of the Bible all my life. As a child I was amazed by the miracles God did. As I got older it was His character that captivated me. I want to know how He thinks, what He’s thinking, and how to make sense of His creation,"" he says. ""These days I’m intrigued by how to planning, planning, His creation, and it isn’t God and the Bible, and I believe that God reveals Himsel back here?"" ""The Bible has always been the whole of my relationships with God. So why is it that I come back here? I believe God reveals himself to me every day."" The Holy Spirit is God’s special presence in this age. Even though God incarnate has ascended into heaven, He did not leave us alone. The same Spirit that indwells Jesus will indwell His disciples, and if we skip ahead to Acts, we can see that this Spirit of Truth indwelled all believers. To believers, He is a source of wisdom and knowledge. We usually call Him the Holy Spirit, but He rightly emphasizes His character and the work that He does in our hearts. We need a Helper to teach us the perfect obedience that Jesus modeled, to get a fuller picture of what the Spirit has come to do. To the unbelieving world, he is the source of conviction, confronting sinners with what He really was and what He did really was. He is our Helper, and He is exactly what we needed next. He will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer. I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth. The Holy Spirit is also committed to a ministry of words and truth. At the heart of the Trinity’s ministry is a message. When we put our faith in Christ, we confess and believe specific realities. Jesus clearly leaves us here with His Spirit and His truth. These are the twin lights guiding us on our pilgrimage. Even though He is not with us physically, He is with us personally, spiritually, verbally. We are sanctified by the truth in order to be with God as the Word draws those two together. We must not forget that our relationship with God is through the Spirit and through the Word. Without Jesus’ work on the Cross we could have no fellowship with God. But even though it is what made a relationship withGod possible, our relationship goes much deeper with God, and our relationship is specially specially blessed by the Cross. We have the Holy Spirit of Truth, and we also have the words of the Father. The words of God are to make us holy. They are to wash us and set us apart. The word is not some passive collection of propositions to be absorbed. The true words and message of Scripture are given to make our lives holy. The Bible is not God's leftovers. It is the word of God. Josh Vajda: Christianity has a lot to say about death, and sacrifice is central to our theology. The Bible is how the Holy Spirit speaks to us; it is one of the means by which God has chosen to sanctify His people. Death is everywhere! It’s all over the Pentateuch. All crimes against God are capital offenses, but technically speaking He could smite everyone the moment they sin. God tells us He gets no pleasure from the death of the wicked. But those who will not get what they deserve should repent and live as God would much rather see them live than die. The Story of Death (2/15/15)February 18, 2015 Josh Vajda	2 Comments on The Matter of Life and Death: Death as Punishment and God. For now we Wait: For Now We Wait: Ash Wednesday, February 19, 2015, at 10:30 a.m. (GMT-4:30 p.m). For now, we wait for Ash Wednesday: February 20, 2016, at 11:00 a. m. ( GMT-3:30p.m.) for the rest of the week. For more information on the Ash Wednesday series, go to: http://www.joshvajda.org/. Christianity has a lot to say about death because it takes sin seriously. God didn’t send the Flood on a whim but because evil on the earth had become unbearable. Because Jesus submitted to death on our behalf, our relationship with death gets really complicated. But every good thing—salvation, resurrection, eternal life, peace with God—these all came from one great death: the Crucifixion. We praise the God of life, but we celebrate His death. God took a horrible, terrible, rotten, no-good thing and redeemed it for us. We baptize in the likeness of His death—and resurrection. We take the bread and cup to remember His death all the while waiting for His return. In Romans, death takes on a whole new meaning: We are God and dead to God. Spiritual death is over now. But make no mistake, Christians still die spiritually. But at the very end of the Bible, we see that when we see Christ will finally be thrown into death, death will be thrown back into all of us. It’s a bleak way to look at things, but not wrong. If we take death out of the context of grace and patience and kindness, we get a very wrong view of God. This week is Ash Wednesday, when Christians are reminded that they are dust. We often think of ourselves as souls who just happen to be in bodies, that our parts are interchangeable. Our bodies are a part of us, and our reflection is a daily reminder that we’re not as strong as we think we are. Recognizing our insufficiency is just one way we deepen our appreciation for all we have in Christ. We humble ourselves not to make Him greater because He has brought us forgiveness and eternal life, sent us His Spirit. We have this gift from God because of love, rich in mercy, Matt Maher says. We all know the story of the Fall from Genesis 3: God meets a perfect woman in the garden and tempts her to disobey him. We don’t have to be perfect to have God’s love. We can be the perfect man. We are not perfect, but we can be better than we are now. We know that God is perfect, and that we are not the perfect person we were meant to be. We cannot be perfect until we are perfect with God. We must humble ourselves and accept our frailty and our mortality. We would have no hope if we left to our own devices, but because of God we have this Gift from God. The story is familiar and the consequences tragic. We live in those consequences. This fall into sin was an act of rebellion against a God who had been nothing but loving and giving. After creation is cursed there’s really nothing left: man's relationships with God, with others, with creation, and even with himself are all broken. And so our need for each other grows even greater, but our incapacity to find what we need and be who we need to be for others makes meeting this need impossible. The Good News glimmers even in that first dark moment. The story is so tempting to read more into the story because there are so many more details we wish we had. The gaps in the story invite our imaginations to jump in, but we must be careful not to put words in God's mouth. The fall was not good, but the only reason they walked that garden alive has to have been God's grace and mercy. And we can’t immediately make God’S grace as bad as thine own as a result of the Fall. It was a mistake for Adam and Eve to have believed in God. Christianity offers the solution to all of the world’s problems, says John Piper. Piper: For all of these problems, the solution is the same: that one seed of woman that God promised, the One to come that would crush the serpent. His name is Jesus. Some of these things were addressed in His first coming when He died on the cross for our sins and rose to life to offer us eternal life. We’ll explain further about that in another part of the book. The hardest part is the part about the new creation, says Piper. We are no longer slaves to sin (seriously!), then why is the world still messed up? And the more to the point, why are WE still messing up? We are the Holy Spirit, and we are waiting for Him to come back to finish the work, to make all things new. We can’t help but “image” our Creator when we act rationally, make wise decisions, love others selflessly, and so on. Instead the image is defaced but not erased. What should normally reflect God”s character instead reflects a mixture of good and evil. The image is intimately wrapped up in the image of God. We won’t be fully free from the effects of sin until Jesus comes back. In theory you should be able to live a perfect life after you’re saved, but because we’ve already been marked by sin in our lives, we will never be perfect under our own power. To guard against those times you need to surround yourself with fellow believers. It sure helps having other people to lean on.

When did KSTP switch to a sports radio format?,"KSTP (1500 AM; SKOR North) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Saint Paul, Minnesota. It is the flagship AM radio station of Hubbard Broadcasting, which also owns several other television and radio stations across the United States.  KSTP has a sports radio format and is the ESPN Radio Network affiliate for Minneapolis-St. Paul.  The radio studios are  on University Avenue in Minneapolis, shared with sister stations KSTP-FM, KSTP-TV, KTMY, and KSTC-TV. On weekdays, KSTP airs local sports shows from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and carries ESPN programming weekday mornings, late nights and weekends. Some KSTP shows are simulcast on other sports radio stations in the region.

KSTP runs the maximum power for AM stations, 50,000 watts.  It shares clear-channel, Class A status on 1500 AM with WFED in Washington, D.C.  KSTP broadcasts a directional signal at night, using a three-tower array, with its transmitter on U.S. Route 61 at Beam Avenue in Maplewood.  Programming is also heard on 250 watt FM translator K235BP at 94.9 MHz in Bemidji.

History

WAMD and KFOY
KSTP's start in 1928 was the product of a merger between two pioneering Twin Cities stations: WAMD (""Where All Minneapolis Dances"") in Minneapolis, first licensed on February 16, 1925 to Stanley E. Hubbard, and KFOY in St. Paul, first licensed on March 12, 1924 to the Beacon Radio Service in St. Paul.

Following a few test transmissions, WAMD made its formal debut broadcast on February 22, 1925. (In later interviews Stanley Hubbard traced WAMD's start to April 1924.) It was located at the Marigold Dance Garden, and featured nightly ""Midnight Frolics"" broadcasts by the ballroom's orchestra. It is claimed that WAMD was the first radio station to be completely supported by running paid advertisements. Effective June 15, 1927, WAMD was assigned to 1330 kHz.

On November 11, 1927 WAMD's transmitter site at Oxboro Heath on Lyndale Avenue South burned down, two weeks after the station had been sold to the National Battery Company. An initial arrangement was made to carry WAMD's programs over WRHM (now WWTC), transmitting on WAMD's 1330 kHz frequency. Beginning on November 24, 1927 the WAMD broadcasts, still on 1330 kHz, were shifted to KFOY's facility in St. Paul. (At this time KFOY was assigned to 1050 kHz). The next day it was announced that National Battery had purchased KFOY, and as of December 1, 1927 both KFOY and WAMD were reassigned to 1350 kHz. WAMD continued making regular broadcasts until the end of March 1928, while KFOY, although it continued to be licensed for a few more months on a time-sharing basis with WAMD, ceased operations at this point.

National Battery Company
In mid-December 1927, the National Battery Company announced it had received permission from the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) to build a new station, with the call letters KSTP, operating from a transmitter site to be constructed three miles south of Wescott. The next month it was reported that the new station, still under construction, had been assigned to 1360 kHz. KSTP made its debut broadcast on March 29, 1928. Although technically it was a separate station from WAMD and KFOY, both of which were formally deleted on April 30, 1928, overall KSTP was treated as the direct successor to a consolidated WAMD and KFOY.

Hubbard became the merged station's general manager, acquiring controlling interest in 1941. A month after the merger, KSTP became an affiliate for the NBC Red Network.  It remained with NBC for 46 years. On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of the FRC's General Order 40, KSTP was assigned to a ""high-powered regional"" frequency of 1460 kHz. The only other station assigned to this frequency was WTFF in Mount Vernon Hills, Virginia (later WJSV, now WFED, Washington, D.C.). On February 7, 1933, the FRC authorized KSTP to increase its daytime power to 25 KW. In 1938 and 1939 KSTP also operated a high-fidelity AM ""experimental audio broadcasting station"" Apex station, W9XUP, originally on 25,950 kHz and later on 26,150 kHz. In 1941, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, KSTP was assigned to its current ""clear channel"" frequency of 1500 kHz, with the provision that it and WJSV, as ""Class I-B"" stations, had to maintain directional antennas at night in order to mutually protect each other from interference. An FM station, KSTP-FM, was founded in 1946 but shut down in 1952.

Hubbard reportedly acquired an RCA TV camera in 1939, and started experimenting with television broadcasts.  But World War II put a hold on the development of television.  In 1948, with the war over, KSTP-TV became the first television station in Minnesota.  With KSTP 1500 already associated with NBC Radio, KSTP-TV became an NBC Television Network affiliate.  From 1946 to 1952, KSTP also had an FM counterpart.  KSTP-FM 102.1 was only on the air four years.  There were few radios equipped to receive FM signals in that era, and management decided to discontinue FM broadcasts.

MOR and Top 40
As network programming moved from radio to television, KSTP programmed a full service Middle of the Road (MOR) radio format, in the shadow of its chief competitor, CBS Radio affiliate 830 WCCO. In 1965, a new FM station, reviving the KSTP-FM call sign, was put on the air, largely simulcasting the AM station.  But by the late 1960s, KSTP-FM began a separate format of beautiful music.  KSTP was the radio home of the Minnesota Vikings football team from 1970 to 1975. 

In 1973, KSTP broke away from its longtime adult MOR sound and became one of four area stations at the time to program a Top 40 format. ""15 KSTP, The Music Station"" competed with Top 40 AM rivals WDGY, KDWB and later, WYOO. The competition would eventually shake itself out, with outrageous rocker WYOO dropping out after being sold in 1976, and then the staid WDGY switching to country music the following year.  As for uptempo hits station 15 KSTP, it went from a tight Top 40 format to leaning adult rock in 1978, to leaning adult contemporary in 1979, to evolving into adult contemporary/talk by 1980.  In 1982, it officially shifted to talk.  Most Top 40 rock music, by this time, had moved to the FM band.

Past Personalities

Notable hosts who have been on KSTP include John Hines, Jesse Ventura, Larry Carolla, Tom Barnard, Big Al Davis, Don Vogel, John MacDougall, Griff, Mike Edwards, Geoff Charles, Joe Soucheray, James Lileks, Leigh Kamman, Barbara Carlson, Peter Thiele, Tom Mischke, Jason Lewis, Chuck Knapp, Machine Gun Kelly, Charle Bush, Mark O'Connell and Paul Brand. These broadcasters were supported by producers such as Bruce Huff, Rob Pendleton, Alison Brown, Jean Bjorgen, David Elvin (who Vogel dubbed the ""Steven Spielberg of Talk Radio""), Mitch Berg and others.

The station has, for the most part, emphasized local hosts over the years.  But in 1988, KSTP was one of Rush Limbaugh's first affiliates when his conservative talk show was rolled out for national syndication.  (Clear Channel-owned KTLK-FM took over rights to Limbaugh's show in January 2006). Other syndicated hosts previously heard on KSTP include Sean Hannity, Bruce Williams, Larry King, and Owen Spann.

Sports Radio
KSTP switched to Sports Radio on February 15, 2010.  As the station had to wait for ESPN's contract with rival KFAN and its sister station KFXN to expire, it did not become an ESPN Radio affiliate until April 12, the same day that the Minnesota Twins were scheduled to play the first game in their new ball park, Target Field, against the Boston Red Sox.  As a result Coast to Coast AM and Live on Sunday Night, it's Bill Cunningham were retained during this period.  One ESPN Radio network program, The Herd with Colin Cowherd, was picked up by KSTP immediately following the format change.

In 2018, the station was approved for an FM translator on 94.1 FM, broadcasting from a transmitter atop the IDS Center in downtown Minneapolis. The two-watt signal threw most of its power to the west, preventing interference to low powered FM stations on the same channel including WFNU-LP in St. Paul. With only two watts of power, however, the signal was limited to the immediate downtown area surrounding the IDS Center.  It later acquired a 250 watt translator, K235BP at 94.9 MHz.  The original translator was discontinued.

On January 15, 2019, KSTP rebranded as ""SKOR North"" (a reference to the Vikings team song/chant, ""Skol, Vikings""), with local programming between 12 noon and 7 pm. About a year later, in May of 2020, KSTP suspended most of its local programming and laid off nearly all of its local staff. Station management cited the economic toll of the coronavirus for the changes. Sports broadcasting continues, primarily composed of ESPN radio network broadcasts.

Sports Teams

KSTP-AM served as the radio flagship for the Minnesota Vikings football team from 1970 to 1975.

On August 1, 2006, the station announced that it would be the new flagship station for the Minnesota Twins baseball team, effective with the start of the 2007 season. The Twins had been on rival WCCO since arriving in Minnesota in 1961.  KSTP served as the flagship for the Twins until the end of the 2012 season, when games moved to 96.3 KTWN-FM (now KMWA).  The Twins have since returned to WCCO 830.

The switch to a fairly weak FM station caused dissent among some listeners, particularly in communities that had trouble picking up KSTP 1500.  Although KSTP is the state's second most powerful AM station, it must operate directionally at night, delivering a reduced signal to parts of the market. WCCO, by comparison, offers a signal with a wider coverage area during the day than KSTP does, with WCCO's non-directional 50,000 watt signal. In response, the Twins have expanded the number of affiliates.

On March 9, 2011, KSTP announced it would be the new flagship for the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers men's and women's basketball and men's ice hockey, ending a 68-year run on WCCO. The rights have since moved to KFXN-FM, which already aired Gopher football.

On March 2, 2017, KSTP announced it would be the first radio broadcaster for Minnesota United FC.  The move brings live soccer action to 1500 AM.

abstract

Dialect Identification is a crucial task for localizing various Large Language Models. This paper outlines our approach to the VarDial 2023 DSL-TL shared task. Here we have to identify three or two dialects from three languages each which results in a 9-way classification for Track-1 and 6-way classification for Track-2 respectively.
Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage system and outperforms other participants' systems and previous works in this domain. We achieve a score of 58.54% for Track-1 and 85.61% for Track-2. Our codebase is available publicly 1 .

Introduction

Language has been the primary mode of communication for humans since the pre-historic ages. Studies have explored the evolution of language and outlined mathematical models that govern the intricacies of natural language . Inevitably, as humans established civilization in various parts of the world, this language was modified by, and for the group of people occupied by that particular geographical region.
This gave rise to multiple national dialects of the same language. The VarDial workshop (colocated with EACL 2023) explores various dialects and variations of the same language. We participated in the Discriminating Between Similar Languages -True Labels (DSL-TL) shared task. In this task, the participants were provided with data from three languages, with each language having three varieties.
This shared task consisted of two tracks -Track-1 featuring nine-way classification and Track-2 featuring six-way classification. The second track included two particular national dialects of each language (eg. American English and British English), and the first track had one general  We ranked 1 st in both of the tracks.
Moreover, we beat the next best submission by a margin of 4.5% in the first task and 5.6% in the second task.We were the only team to surpass the organizer baseline scores. We present our winning solution in this paper. We used an end-to-end deep learning pipeline which consisted of a language identification model and three language-specific models, one for each language.
We converged upon the best combination by doing an elaborate analysis of various models available. Furthermore, in this work we also analyze the performance of the pipeline as a whole and also provide an ablation study. Lastly, we provide some future directions in this area of research.

Related Work

The present literature encompasses various aspects of dialect identification. We study this from three perspectives: large language models, language identification and dialect classification problems.

Large Language Models

The success of transformers and BERT based models was inevitable since the initial boom of the transformer  2017) model. In recent years, many other architectures like RoBERTa and ELECTRA have further pushed the state-of-the-art in this domain. Moreover, autoregressive models like GPT and GPT-2 have also shown their prowess.
Multilingual versions of RoBERTA, namely XLM-RoBERTa are also available. Lastly, language specific models like Spanish BERT (la Rosa y Eduardo G. Ponferrada y Manu Romero y Paulo Villegas y Pablo González de Prado Salas y María Grandury, 2022) and Portuguese BERT are available as well. Our winning solution makes use of these large language models trained on specific languages.

Language Identification Models

Many multilingual language identification models have been developed in order to classify the language of the input sentence beforehand. Even though the initial works used n-gram models and generative mixture models or even conditional random fields and other classical machine learning methods like naive bayes , modern methods have shifted to the use of deep learning for language identification .
Recent works have mainly focused on deep learning based language identification, where handling codemixed data is a big challenge in the domain. For our experiments, we use a version of XLM-RoBERTa finetuned on a language identification dataset 2 . This model has near-perfect test accuracy of 99.6%.

Dialect Classification

Dialect classification has been previously solved using statistical methods like Gaussian Mixture Models and Frame Selection Decoding or Support Vector Machines (SVM) . It has been explored relatively sparsely, mostly in the case for local languages . Deep learning approaches have been explored in previous editions of the VarDial workshop shared tasks and otherwise .
Dialect classification was also explored previously as a part of other shared tasks . We want to stress that given the multilingual nature of the dataset, using the present methods directly was not an option. In our work, although we take inspiration from the previous works, we propose a novel system that surpasses the performance of the previous systems by a large margin.

Data

The dataset  We observed that the class PT-BR had the most number of samples (2,724) and the class EN had the least number of samples (349), and thus the imbalance ratio was almost 1:8. We have illustrated the data distribution in Figure . We tried to mitigate this imbalance using over-sampling and weighted sampling methods.
However, the improved data sampling method did not affect the performance.

System Description

This was a problem of multi-class classification having 9 classes for Track-1 and 6 classes for Track-2. The samples were belonging to 3 languages having 3 varieties each, so the classification pipeline was made in 2 stages. The Language Identification (LID) model which is the first stage classifies the sentence into 3 languages: English (EN), Spanish (ES) and Portuguese (PT).
The LID is a pretrained XLM-RoBERTa that is fine-tuned for the task of language identification. It is able to classify the input sentence into 20 languages. We classify and separate the samples according to their language. The samples corresponding to the specific languages are then fed into the language specific models for dialect identification.
For dialect identification we have used models like BERT and RoBERTa with a linear layer connected to the pooler output of the models. Then fine-tuning is done on the models for dialect identification   using the samples corresponding to the specific languages. For the task of dialect identification we experimented with several pretrained models like XLM-RoBERTa, BERT, ELECTRA, GPT-2 and RoBERTa.
All models were fine-tuned for 20 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-6 and weight decay 1e-6 with a batch size of 8. The best performing model checkpoint was chosen according to the epoch-wise validation macro-F1 score. 5 Experiments and Results

Experiments using Large Language Models

For the task of Dialect Identification we have tried various language specific models like XLM-RoBERTa, BERT, ELECTRA, RoBERTa and GPT- 2. The base variant of all these models were used and all the models were used through the Hugging-Face library. The pooler output of these models was passed through a linear layer and the models were fine-tuned.
First, we experimented with different models for Track-1. All the models were trained for 20 epochs with learning rate 1e-6, weight decay 1e-6 and a batch size of 8. We used XLM-RoBERTa as the baseline for all 3 languages. The best performing models for the English language were RoBERTa and BERT whereas GPT-2 was the worst performing.
Similarly the language specific versions of RoBERTa and BERT performed well for the Spanish and Portuguese respectively. Overall the worst performing model was GPT-2 across all 3 languages. The validation F1 scores are present in Table . The two best-performing models for every language were chosen for Track-2.
The same procedure as specified above was used and the F1 scores are present in Table . The train and validation F1 scores for 2-class classification are higher for all models as compared to the F1 score of the same models for 3-class classification. This was mainly due to the poor representation and accuracy of classification of the third class.
We observed symptoms of overfitting in all models after 12-15 epochs and the best validation F1 score was obtained in the range of 4-8 epochs.

LID experiments

The pipeline for dialect identification is divided into two parts as the sentences in the dataset belong to different languages. The stages are described in Section 4. The XLM-RoBERTa we have used for language classification has a test accuracy of 99.6% meaning it correctly classifies all input sentences and hence, can be considered as a perfect classifier.
For the final pipeline we experimented using the two best performing models for each language in Track-1 and Track-2. For both the tracks we experimented with all 8 (2 3 ) possible combinations of models and calculated the validation F1 score for the combined validation dataset which had sentences belonging to all languages.
The validation scores for Track-1 and Track-2 are shown in Table and Table respectively. For both the tracks, the three pipelines with the best validation F1 scores were chosen for submission.

Using 3-way classifier as a 2-way classifier

In Track-1, participants are expected to train a classifier which classifies amongst 9 classes, and in Track-2, participants are expected to train a classifier which classifies amongst 6 classes. These 6 classes are a proper subset of the 9 classes from Track-1. Thus, an intuitive baseline for Track-2 is to use the model finetuned for Track-1, whilst considering only the relevant classes for the latter task.
The classes EN , ES and P T , i.e. the classes without any national dialect associated with them are not included in Track-2 as compared to Track-1. Thus, we calculate the predictions for the Track-2 validation dataset using the models for Track-1 and exclude the metrics for Track-1 specific classes to get the metrics for this ""adapted"" 2-way classification.
We show the results of this experiment in Table and observe that, as expected, the adapted 2-way classification performs worse compared to the explicitly finetuned variant.

Results for Track-1 and Track-2

We now present our experiments and their performance for both tracks. Our experiments for Track-1 are described in Table and our experiments for Track-2 are described in Table . The participants were allowed three submissions for evaluation on the test set, so we submitted predictions using the three systems which performed the best on the validation set.
As mentioned in Section 5.2, we performed 2 3 , i.e. a total of 8 experiments using the two best models for each language. We observed that RoBERTa base on English, Spanish BERT base on Spanish and Portuguese BERT base performed the best on the testing set for Track-1. The same combination, with RoBERTa base for English, worked best for Track-2.
All of our submissions were the top submissions for each track, which surpassed the next best competitors by a margin of 4.5% and 5.6% for Track-1 and Track-2 respectively.

Ablation of best submissions

We hereby make some observations of our submissions and other experiments. To assist this, we plot the confusion matrices of our best submissions for Track-1 and Track-2 in Figures respectively. Note that these confusion matrices have their rows (i.e. true labels axes) normalized according to the number of samples in the class.
Here are observations from our experiments: 1. BERT-based models outperform other models across all languages: We observe that BERT-based models outperform ELECTRA-based and GPT-2-based models, as shown in Table . We speculate this is because of the inherent architecture of BERT, which combines semantic learning with knowledge retention.
This combination of traits is particularly useful for this task. 2. Common labels perform the worst across all languages: We observe that the common labels EN , ES and P T perform the worst, both in the individual as well as the two-stage setup. We hypothesize this is because of the absence of dialect specific words, or words that are specific to the geographical origin of the national dialect (for example, ""Yankees"" for EN-US and ""Oxford"" for EN-GB).
3. English models work better than models of other languages: It can be noted from Figures 4 and 3 that the English models have the best performance across all classes. This can be attributed to two reasons: absence of national dialect specific words and lesser pretraining data in the case of Portuguese.
4. British English is most correctly classified class: We can observe that the Spanish or Portuguese models make equal number of mistakes in the case of either national dialect, in the case of Track-2 (see Figure ). However, in the case of English, the label EN − GB is correctly classified for more than 95% of the cases.
We speculate this is because British English involves slightly distinctive grammar and semantics, which help the model separate it from other classes. 5. The proposed 2-step method is scalable for multiple language dialect classification: We can strongly assert that the novel 2-step deep learning method for multilingual dialect classification is a scalable method for the task due to two specific reasons: firstly, the multilingual models (like XLM-RoBERTa) might not have the vocabulary as well as the learning capabilities to learn the minute differences between individual dialects.
Secondly, this system can be quickly expanded for a new language by simply adding a language specific dialect classifier, provided the language identification model supports that particular language.

Conclusion

In this paper we propose a two-stage classification pipeline for dialect identification for multilingual corpora. We conduct thorough ablations on this setup and provide valuable insights. We foresee multiple future directions for this work. The first is to expand this work to many languages and dialects.
Secondly, it is a worthwhile research direction to distill this multi-model setup into a single model with multiple prediction heads. The obvious limitation of this system is the excessive memory consumption due to the usage of language specific models. For low resource languages this system is difficult to train and scale.
We hope that these problems will be addressed by researchers in future works.",['The best performing model for the Spanish language in Track-1 was Spanish BERT.'],2409,multifieldqa_en,en,,fe952dfd723c9b88f1ed4665679b7a13987729fa1c37b0e3," The LID classifies the input into one of 3 languages.

How does the infall rate and gas density in the magnetized model compare to non-magnetized accretion?,"\section{Introduction}
The averaged quantities can be obtained in two different ways in
magnetohydrodynamics. The first way is to solve 3D MHD equations
and then average the results. The second way is to solve some
system of equations on averages. Combination of numerical
simulations and averaged theory brings phenomenology that can
describe observations or experimental data.

The problem of spherically symmetric accretion takes its origin
from Bondi's work \citep{bondi}. He presented idealized
hydrodynamic solution with accretion rate $\dot{M}_B.$ However,
magnetic field $\vec{B}$ always exists in the real systems. Even
small seed $\vec{B}$ amplifies in spherical infall and becomes
dynamically important \citep{schwa}.

Magnetic field inhibits accretion \citep{schwa}. None of many
theories has reasonably calculated the magnetic field evolution
and how it influences dynamics. These theories have some common
pitfalls. First of all, the direction of magnetic field is usually
defined. Secondly, the magnetic field strength is prescribed by
thermal equipartition assumption. In third, dynamical effect of
magnetic field is calculated with conventional magnetic energy and
pressure. All these inaccuracies can be eliminated.

In Section 2\ref{section_method} I develop a model that abandons
equipartition prescription, calculates the magnetic field
direction and strength and employs the correct equations of
magnetized fluid dynamics. In Section 3\ref{results} I show this
accretion pattern to be in qualitative agreement with Sgr A*
spectrum models. I discuss my assumptions in Section 4
\ref{discussion}.

\section{Analytical method}\label{section_method}
 Reasonable turbulence evolution model is the key difference of my
 method. I build an averaged turbulence theory that corresponds to
numerical simulations. I start with the model of isotropic
turbulence that is consistent with simulations of collisional MHD
in three regimes. Those regimes are decaying hydrodynamic
turbulence, decaying MHD turbulence and dynamo action. I introduce
effective isotropization of magnetic field in 3D model.
Isotropization is taken to have a timescale of the order of
dissipation timescale that is a fraction $\gamma\sim1$ of the
Alfven wave crossing time $\tau_{\rm diss}=\gamma r/v_A.$

Common misconception exists about the dynamical influence of
magnetic field. Neither magnetic energy nor magnetic pressure can
represent $\vec{B}$ in dynamics. Correct averaged Euler and energy
equations were derived in \citep{scharlemann} for radial magnetic
field. Magnetic force $\vec{F}_M=[\vec{j}\times\vec{B}]$ can be
averaged over the solid angle with proper combination of
$\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{B}=0.$ I extend the derivation to random
magnetic field without preferred direction. Dynamical effect of
magnetic helicity \citep{biskamp03} is also investigated. I
neglect radiative and mechanical transport processes.

The derived set of equations requires some modifications and
boundary conditions to be applicable to the real astrophysical
systems. I add external energy input to turbulence to balance
dissipative processes in the outer flow. The outer turbulence is
taken to be isotropic and has magnetization $\sigma\sim1.$
Transonic smooth solution is chosen as possessing the highest
accretion rate as in \citep{bondi}.

\begin{figure}\label{fig1}
  \includegraphics[height=.5\textheight]{velocities}
  \caption{Normalized to Keplerian speed characteristic velocities of magnetized flow. Horizontal lines correspond to self-similar solution $v\sim r^{-1/2}.$}
\end{figure}

\section{Results \& Application to Sgr A*}\label{results}

\begin{figure}\label{fig2}
  \includegraphics[height=.5\textheight]{magnetization}
  \caption{Plot of magnetization $\sigma=(E_M+E_K)/E_{Th}$ with radius.}
\end{figure}
The results of my calculations confirm some known facts about
spherical magnetized accretion, agree with the results of
numerical simulations and have some previously unidentified
features.

Initially isotropic magnetic field exhibits strong anisotropy with
larger radial field $B_r.$ Perpendicular magnetic field
$B_\perp\ll B_r$ is dynamically unimportant in the inner accretion
region Fig\ref{fig1}. Because magnetic field dissipates, infall
onto the black hole can proceed \citep{schwa}.

Turbulence is supported by external driving in the outer flow
regions, but internal driving due to freezing-in amplification
takes over in the inner flow Fig\ref{fig2}. Magnetization of the
flow increases in the inner region with decreasing radius
consistently with simulations \cite{igumen06}. Density profile
appears to be $\rho\sim r^{-1.25}$ that is different from
traditional ADAF scaling $\rho\sim r^{-1.5}$ \citep{narayan}. Thus
the idea of self-similar behavior is not supported.

Compared to non-magnetized accretion, infall rate is 2-5 times
smaller depending on outer magnetization. In turn, gas density is
2-5 times smaller in the region close to the black hole, where
synchrotron radiation emerges \citep{narayan}. Sgr A* produces
relatively weak synchrotron \citep{narayan}. So, either gas
density $n$ or electron temperature $T_e$ or magnetic field $B$
are small in the inner flow or combination of factors works. Thus
low gas density in magnetized model is in qualitative agreement
with the results of modelling the spectrum.

Flow is convectively stable on average in the model of moving
blobs, where dissipation heat is released homogeneously in volume.
Moving blobs are in radial and perpendicular pressure
equilibriums. They are governed by the same equations as the
medium.

\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}\label{discussion}
The presented accretion study self-consistently treats turbulence
in the averaged model. This model introduces many weak assumptions
instead of few strong ones.

I take dissipation rate to be that of collisional MHD simulations.
But flow in question is rather in collisionless regime.
Observations of collisionless flares in solar corona
\citep{noglik} gives dissipation rate $20$ times smaller than in
collisional simulations \citep{biskamp03}. However, flares in
solar corona may represent a large-scale reconnection event rather
than developed turbulence. It is unclear which dissipation rate is
more realistic for accretion.

Magnetic field presents another caveat. Magnetic field lines
should close, or $\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{B}=0$ should hold. Radial
field is much larger than perpendicular in the inner region.
Therefore, characteristic radial scale of the flow is much larger
than perpendicular. If radial turbulence scale is larger than
radius, freezing-in condition does not hold anymore. Matter can
freely slip along radial field lines into the black hole. If
matter slips already at the sonic point, the accretion rate should
be higher than calculated.

Some other assumptions are more likely to be valid. Diffusion
should be weak because of high Mach number that approaches unity
at large radius. Magnetic helicity was found to play very small
dynamical role. Only when the initial turbulence is highly
helical, magnetic helicity conservation may lead to smaller
accretion rate. Neglect of radiative cooling is justified a
posteriori. Line cooling time is about $20$ times larger that
inflow time from outer boundary.

The study is the extension of basic theory, but realistic
analytical models should include more physics. The work is
underway.

The derived set of equations requires some modifications to be applicable to the real astrophysical astrophysical systems.

"According to the text, what is Toby Schindelbeck's observation about the police?","July | 2012 | Chico Taxpayers Association
Keep a Knockin’ but you can’t come in! Come back next Tuesday night and try it again! And be sure to bring plenty of your friends.
Toby Schindelbeck has finally been rewarded for his persistence – he’s been going before Chico City Council, asking that Finance MisDirector Jennifer Hennessy comply with city code and give a budget report at every meeting. City clerk Debbie Presson has informed him that this subject will be “discussed” at the August 7 council meeting.
But we know, it won’t be a very good “discussion” unless a bunch of people come in and demand some action. Toby has observed that issues like Corporate Personhood and the “single-use” plastic bag ban have drawn fairly small crowds – he estimates 25 – 30 people, and I’d say he’s being generous. The city has acted on these issues, with only that small fraction of the population in support. So, Toby believes there needs to be an even stronger presence to get a decent discussion on this matter, and I agree.
Like Toby and Stephanie Taber and others have been saying, the city code calls for a monthly budget report, with sticky details like receipts, etc, and Jennifer Hennessy admits she has not made such a report in the seven years she’s been with the city of Chico. Try not paying your taxes for seven years – you’ll get the same treatment as the man from Touch of Class Florist – 68 years old, and he’s being sent to PRISON. But Jennifer Hennessy and her boss Dave Burkland, and their overseer, Mayor Ann Schwab, get to flog the law right in front of everybody, and Ann just steps right into that little red convertible and drives off to her palatial estate in Forest Ranch.
The law is a piece of paper. It takes people to demand law enforcement. We’ve got a serious law enforcement problem in our town. The police say they aren’t paid enough to enforce the laws in the streets, and now Dave Burkland says, he just doesn’t have to.
And your mayor won’t make him either. He’s retiring, on more than $150,000 a year, for the rest of his life, but she’s up for election in November – time to take out the trash.
That meeting is scheduled for August 7, the usual time, the usual place. I’ll keep you posted.

Stephanie Taber answers Quentin Colgan’s letter to the News and Review
I get complaints from friends and strangers, and it has also been my own experience, that the editor of the Chico News and Review is not always objective in deciding which letters received from the public will be printed in the paper and which ones won’t. Robert Speer has offered me excuses, but I have always found him to be disingenuous. For example – he told me he would only run letters that referenced an article or letter recently printed in the paper – untrue a million times over. He also told me he wouldn’t print letters that had already run in the Enterprise Record – also untrue a million times over. The man has his own reasons for running or not running letters.
David Little is more objective, but he’s got his faults too – once he threw out a letter from my husband and later admitted he had thought I’d written it and used my old man’s name. He just threw it out without even calling the phone number or e-mailing, just assumed I’d do something like that when I’d never done anything like that before, because he was mad at me over a snit we were having at the time.
I think Little gets his nose out at people personally, and Hell hath no fury, know what I mean? With Speer it can personal but I think it’s most often political. Suffice to say, they both carry what my dad used to call a “Shit List,” and if you’re on it, you don’t get ink in their rag.
Of course either paper is equally likely to print a total wad of lies or misinformation without so much as a google fact check. I will never forget the time Dave Little printed a letter saying the cops had been called to my house on a dog complaint. The letter writer insinuated that this was why I often wrote letters complaining about the cop contracts. I called Little and told him the letter was false, nothing like that had ever happened – but he wouldn’t retract it. I had to look the old man up in the phone book and call him myself, tell him he had been misinformed, and ask him to write a retraction. He apologized profusely and the apology was in the paper within three days. He wouldn’t tell me where he got the information, but later I found out he was a member of VIPS, and he still is. I think that’s something Dave Little could have looked into before he printed a story like that about me and my family, not to mention my dogs, but he didn’t see it that way. Poor journalism, is how I see it, and that’s what I’ve come to expect out of both the daily and the weekly.
So, pardon me if I was not surprised when my friend Stephanie mentioned to me that she didn’t think Speer would run her response to a letter from Quentin Colgan, regarding our current fiscal morass. QC made an argument he has been swinging around town lately – that Fire Station 5 had to be closed recently because the Tea Party forced the city to have a $150,000 election over Measure A.
The first problem I have with this argument is, the city is out a heck of a lot more than $150,000. The second problem I have is, I happen to know that over 8,000 Chicoans signed that petition, and there’s not more than 600 active members of the Tea Party. I also know the Tea Party didn’t sponsor the petition drive, nor were they the only people that marched out with those petitions. Colgan’s argument doesn’t make sense to me, but it’s amazing what kind of “facts” the general populace will believe if you just keep repeating them.
Some folks are trying to use the Tea Party as a target to rile up their peanut gallery, using Measure A as their rally call. They keep banging the same old drum. They refuse to have a rational discussion about the situation we’re facing, because it’s going to mean some sour beans for them and their trough-dwelling friends.
So, it’s up to a rational person like Stephanie Taber to lay it out straight for those who like facts. Stephanie attends the meetings, she reads the reports, she goes to the trouble of putting questions in writing for $taff, and then waiting persistently for an answer that practically has to be deciphered by a lawyer. She has followed this budget conversation since the day then-city-manager and first rat to jump, Greg Jones, expressed his grave concerns that we were headed straight for bankruptcy. She has followed the figures and checked the facts until she has forced these rats right to the wall – they have lately begun to dig their feet in and refuse to obey the sunshine laws, refusing to give the fiscal reports demanded by the city charter. Some people can try to run their little smokescreen of repetitive nonsense, but more rational people are finding out the truth. Thanks to Stephanie Taber for writing this letter below, which may or may not run in the Chico News and Review:
I’d like to take this opportunity to respond to Quentin Colgan’s letter of July 12th; primarily because the costs surrounding the Special Election held regarding Measure A have been distorted. Yes, it did cost $150,000, but why? That’s the elephant in the room. The progressives on the City Council chose the method by which the election would be held. Per the City Charter (which is the City’s Constitution) Section 501 clearly states “The City Council may determine that any Special Election shall be held by mailed ballot” etc. That would have cut the cost by half, at least. But the Council chose the most expensive means possible, voting at the precinct. They were afraid that just telling the students they were being disenfranchised, which was an obvious lie, would not be sufficient to defeat it.
As to “it’s all the Tea Party’s fault”; I was the only signature to the Measure. I felt no need to consult the Tea Party before I took that action; but did enlist the help of many concerned citizens to gather the more than 8,000 signature required to put it on the ballot.
Toby Schindelbeck has called upon our Finance Director to adhere to Section 908 of the City’s Charter which states “(the) Finance Director shall submit to the Council through the City Manager monthly statements of receipts, disbursements and balances in such form as to show the exact financial condition of the City”. It does not state when you may want to or if you have time to; it says “shall”. No one on the Council or otherwise can remember when that may have happened last. If it was being done as the Charter states it would have been recognize that the City was facing a financial Armageddon and steps could have been taken much earlier in the fiscal year to avoid the closing of Fire Station 5.

City Art Director Mary Gardner is foisting a new “Art Tax” on us to pay her own salary
To mgardner@ci.chico.ca.us, gerimahood@yahoo.com, mcbergarts@gmail.com
(Mary Gardner, city of Chico public arts director, city of Chico, Geraldine Mahood and Monica Berg of the Arts Commission)
I recently read your memo here
Chico-Arts-Building-Tax.pdf
I think it’s despicable Ms. Gardner that you are trying raise revenues for your own salary by foisting a new “Art Tax” on new development.
Ms. Mahood, Ms. Berg, nobody wants eggsuckers like you telling them how to spend their money or what’s “art”. You people make me sick.
The Chico Taxpayers Association will fight this grab, as will other civic groups through the area. That’s why you’ve kept your efforts “under the radar” I assume – you don’t want people to know about this, because you don’t want to hear what they think about it. Or YOU!
You people need to get real jobs and quit sucking off the public teat.

Jennifer Hennessy is incompetent – she can’t do her job and Burkland says she doesn’t have to
I’ll never forget my first real job – a clerical position at a manufacturing plant. I would compare it to the story of the miller’s daughter. On the first day, I was told that the employee I was to be replacing would stick around for a week to train me. At noon that day, having shown me where everything was and how to use the coffee maker, she got up from her chair, smiled, and told me she thought I could “handle it,” then left. At one o’clock, the plant manager came over to my desk followed by several “production” workers. They brought cart loads of microfilm, on rolls, in little white boxes. I was to label all of those boxes, three carts, piled high. This job had gotten held up, he explained, it would be “great!” if it could go out today. Did I think I could get them done by 4 o’clock? I wanted to make everybody happy, so said I yes without thinking, and set to work loading the labels into the typewriter.
It was a disaster. I had never typed anything like those labels before – typing class had been all about letters and envelopes, columns and reports. The labels skittered all over the platen, getting glue all over the inside of the typewriter. About every 50 or so labels, the platen had to be taken out and cleaned with alcohol. I typed and typed. By 3 o’clock I knew I was in trouble. The production workers had come over to my desk to help me affix the sticky labels. We were nervous, labels were getting screwed up. At 3:30 the office manager and receptionist came back to my desk to help with the labels. I typed and typed, and tried not to cry.
We didn’t make it. The plant manager was flustered. The salesman who’d promised the job was really pissed off, he said mean things. I apologized again and again, they told me it wasn’t all my fault, but could I please be more careful what I committed myself to in future. I could tell they also expected me to get a hell of a lot faster, but they were just trying to be nice.
So, I got faster. I came in early in the morning and worked through lunch until I got better at my job. I had signed up for a typing job, nobody had described all the weird stuff they expected me to type. It started with typing and labeling, not only sticky labels, but microfiche jackets. They have a little quarter inch tall label strip across the top that chips and peels if you aren’t careful loading them into the typewriter, and strips or frames of 35 and 16 mm film that falls out in your typewriter. Then there were the three-part work orders, with carbon paper, and the three-part shipping labels, also with carbon paper. There were the mistakes – whole orders that had been indexed incorrectly, and therefore typed incorrectly, and therefore had to be corrected and typed all over again. I won’t describe what I had to go through to correct microfiche labels, it was too stupid. I hated doing that, so I asked for my own little “eye-loup” – a little magnifier that you hold up to a light to look at the tiny little page numbers on the film – to make sure the cards had been indexed correctly before I typed them.
I’m not perfect, but I know I’m competent, cause I kept that job for five years while I watched others get fired, for everything from showing up late to breaking expensive equipment to stealing. I was given new jobs and increased responsibility as time went by. I got good job reviews from my supervisors, and good raises. Morale was high, we liked our co-workers and our managers, we felt like a team. Our customers were nice to us too. We worked for cities and counties, hospitals, banks – anybody who needed to keep records. We were trusted to handle confidential records, like people’s medical records. As we handled these confidential files we were simply told, “Don’t look at them,” so we didn’t.
I left in 1984 in finish school. Over the next decade computers killed the microfilm industry, and the company went out of business.
Excuse me if I compare my experiences in the private sector with stuff I’ve seen coming out of our city $taff. I keep waiting for some professional behavior, some professional accountability out of the people who run our town, and I start to wonder if I will ever get it. For a couple of months now, Toby Schindelbeck and Stephanie Taber, among others, have been asking council and Finance MisDirector Jennifer Hennessy to provide a simple accounting of city finances, as is required by the city charter, and she just plain refuses to give it. City Mangler Dave Burkland won’t make her.
Last month she actually admitted, she is UNABLE to do it. At the June 5 meeting she admitted that she is incompetent to follow the city charter. She said that when she came to her position seven years ago, she “struggled” with doing such a report – something every house wife does – and went whining to then-city-manager Tom Lando, who apparently patted her on the head and told her she didn’t have to do it anymore.
I don’t know about you guys, but I go over my check book every month, just to make sure everything is straight. I’ve found big, dumb mistakes, in the 100’s column even, that could have caused big, dumb problems down the road. I’m no math instructor, like Mary Goloff, but it’s not exactly rocket science – you just add your deposits and subtract your checks and withdrawals. I’ll admit, when my kids were little, I felt like I never had time to do that, and stuff would get screwed up. So now that I’ve got time, I make it a regularly scheduled event, and it’s amazing how much easier it is. And, I can keep the figures in my head, I know essentially how much I can afford to spend when I’m at the grocery store, or what kind of activities we can plan. My husband and son are enjoying a weekend trip right now that is already paid for, thankyouverymuch.
But Jennifer Hennessy is unable to do that? And she has expectable stuff – over 80 percent of her budget is payroll. She doesn’t have that many emergencies. The biggest emergency she’s had lately, is that the state has taken back the fund she’s been mis-using – the RDA. She was paying salaries and benefits out of a fund that’s supposed to be reserved for emergency public works projects. In other words, she’s been dipping into the till to pay her own salary!
The mayor is to blame here, she’s the captain of our ship. Unfortunately, like the captain of the Costa Concordia, she’s abandoned ship for a party onshore. While she and her college chums bully their bag ban down our throats, our ship is sinking. We have less than $200,000 in our reserve fund, we have un-secured pension obligations totaling in the millions and growing every day, and we have $taff who are using blackmail to get their way – they are just refusing to do their jobs. Hennessy won’t give the report she’s required to give because it’s BAD. I think the mayor is completely behind her on this – Ann Schwab doesn’t want us to hear that report either. Would you?
Please write a letter to council demanding that Hennessy do her job, or get out.

Scranton, Pennsylvania cuts workers to minimum wage – only $130,000 in their cash reserves
I finally got a chance to watch the video of last Tuesday’s council meeting. It cut on me during the meeting, just after Walker and Goloff were mopping up their attack on Sorensen, and I didn’t get it back til yesterday. I have watched the video in bits and snatches. I made it to the noise ordinance conversation last night, but had to turn it off after Jessica Allen and a couple of her friends got up to demand their rights to be bad neighbors.
One thing I learned is that the city of Chico has less than $200,000 in the reserve fund. No, I did not forget a zero on that figure, that’s it – less than $200,000. Read it and weep – and then call them to ask what they did with that property tax check you just sent in.
You can look at the budget report here: http://www.chico.ca.us/finance/budget.asp
You see the millions the city takes in, in sales tax (over $17 million) property tax (over $11 million), even taxes on your PG&E, phone and water (almost $7 million), and your visitors’ motel rooms (over $2 million). To me that seems petty – “bed tax”? Some people think it’s a good idea to shake down the visitors of your town, as if it’s not enough that they spend money on your motels, restaurants and shopping centers. It’s a common grab all over California, every city does it. A lot of distasteful things become “common” when no decent person stands up to say “enough is enough.”
In Chico, as has been oft repeated, over 80 percent of our budget is in salaries and benefits. That’s the elephant in the room, and everybody’s getting pretty hip deep in elephant shit around here. It’s a simple concept, no matter how convoluted $taff and council try to make it: if they spend all the money on salaries, benefits, and the Great Pension Stock Market Disaster, there’s no money left to pay for supplies to say, clean up leaks in the sewer and water lines that are causing the state to fine us by the day, widen the roads that we are required to widen because of the permitting of Meriam Park, etc. And you can just get used to those pot holes in the street out front of your house. Got bad neighbors? Get a lawyer.
What’s really frustrating are the reactions of the cops and fire – they act like they don’t get paid at all. Those guys take most of the 80 percent. They get overtime written into their schedules. According to Hennessy, both fire and the cops are over budget on their workman’s comp claims for at least the third year in a row. The city just slammed another cop contract past us without public review, and signed the new chief’s contract three days before it was made available to the public, and then only by request and a direct visit to the clerk’s office Downtown.
So, we will get another year of poor response times, bitching and moaning from cops and fire. Get ready for your homeowners and your car insurance to go up – the insurance companies know when your local police and fire departments are a pile of shit.
And don’t think I’m not wondering about all those suspicious house fires.
You can just forget about any of the services a city is supposed to offer. Try to get something out of the city clerk these days – if you can catch her in the office!
Well, here’s the story of Scranton, Pennsylvania – home of Michael Scott!
http://bottomline.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/07/10/12659748-scranton-pa-slashes-workers-pay-to-minimum-wage?lite
The mayor of Scranton, when faced with a situation similar to Chico’s mess, did what needed to be done. Unfortunately, he waited until it was too late to do something rational. I’m afraid it’s come to that with our city council – if you think that scene between Goloff and Sorensen was rational, well, you deserve to live here.

Marysville council rejects sales tax ploy by retiring city administrator – where’s Chico’s knight in shining armor?
I am not a member of the Chico Chamber of Commerce, but I check in to their website regularly to see what they’re up to. Sometimes I believe, they are the real Chico City Council. While our elected leaders frolic and cavort in their stupid committee meetings, the Chamber is working on a “Top 10 Economic Development Action List”.
Yeah, sounds great, until you consider, one of their “Top 10” is a proposal to raise the local sales tax.
One prominent member of the Chamber who might be able to fill us in on the discussion is Bob Evans. I’ve asked Bob where he stands on this tax increase, but he just keeps saying he hasn’t seen a proposal yet. Lately I have asked him if he would require Lando and the other sales tax increase proponents to get the legal number of signatures on a petition before he votes to put this proposal on the ballot, but he won’t answer me. His downright refusal to discuss the tax increase is frustrating to me – I want to believe Bob is a “fiscal conservative.” After all, he had some high and mighty things to say about his opposition to the phone tax. But, he knew the phone tax didn’t need his support to get on the ballot. It’s easy to posture as the good guy when you know others will achieve the end result you really want. Evans’ resistance to making a pledge against a sales tax increase is screaming in my ear like a fire alarm.
In Marysville, Mayor Bill Harris had no trouble making himself clear when his city mangler proposed a half-cent sales tax increase: “This will be viewed as the City Council coming to them wanting more money again.”
Well, the article mentioned, the city mangler is retiring, so I would also see it as his way of securing his f-ing pension, but nobody mentions that.
City councilwoman Christina Billeci echoed a sentiment I’ve been hearing increasingly in Chico – “We need to balance the budget with the revenues we have,” she said.
Other council members cited lack of support from citizens, including one councillor who claimed to have got “angry reactions” to the proposal. One council member said he might have supported the move before the June election, “But the cigarette tax was voted down, and that should have been a slam dunk,” he said. “I would see this as a waste of effort and money.”
The only council member who supported the notion, Head Start administrator Ricky Samayoa, made some pretty disparaging remarks about the town.
“There’s a lot of people that know there’s a lack of resources here for us to have a proper city and manage it,” he said. Oooo! A “proper city”! What a bitch! Does he have letters from constituents to support this statement, or is he just using “a lot of people” to describe himself and his co-workers? Not enough drive through coffee stands for you Ricky? Not enough 5 Star restaurants or pink boutiques? Sorry, we’ve never been ones for putting on the Ritz here in the North State, better get in your zip car and drive back to the Bay Area.
In the Enterprise Record story, Samoyoa further claimed that “continued cuts to maintenance and other aspects of the city’s budget hurt chances for an economic recovery.” I imagine Marysville has the same problem Chico has – too many $100,000+ salaries and not enough $20,000 – $50,000 workers. While he’s sitting down there under the air conditioner vent at Head Start in a fresh shirt and manicure, the streets are going unmaintained, the classrooms overcrowded, the police and fire departments underfunded – is that the problem Mr. Samayoa?
“The way we’re continuing to go, it’s just going to be a dying city, even if the economy picks up,” he said. Now, that statement doesn’t even make sense. This is a typical example of scare tactics. “The way we’re continuing to go…” You mean, paying $100,000+ salaries to fat bureaucrats, while cutting services to the public? Somehow I don’t think that’s what he’s talking about. ” …it’s just going to be a dying city…” Wow, what an idiot – obviously no knowledge of local history. Marysville has been through so many booms and busts, it ought to be called “Bouncyville.” If you get to know Marysville, you see it has everything needed to be a wonderful place to live, in good times and bad, regardless of carpetbaggers like Samayoa.
“Give folks the opportunity to have this debate,” Mr. Samayoa suggests. Sounds like the rhetoric coming from Andy Holcombe and the rest of the sales tax increase proponents. Hey, that’s a swell idea! People should talk about these things, hash them out. And then, if enough of them sign a petition to put such a proposal on a legal ballot, well, they can VOTE on it! But that costs alot of money – best for those who really believe in this cockamamie idea to get the petition first, show the need to spend all that money on an election. That’s what rational people would do, anyway.
But if you ask Holcombe to discuss the pending proposal, he denies there is any such thing. The only member of Chico City Council who is willing to discuss this proposal at all has been Mark Sorensen – thanks Mark. At least Mark has been good enough to answer our questions about the mechanics of such a proposal and getting it onto the ballot. Evans and Holcombe have both denied knowing anything about it, although Holcombe has made it good and clear he’d support raising the sales tax and Evans has been seen at Chamber discussions on the matter. The others have been mum to the public, but I’m guessing they will support it. Holcombe, Schwab, Goloff, Walker, Gruendl – and Evans? – are all banking on more revenues to rescue the city from the Shit Creek they’ve floated us up. Evans, while he will admit we’re in deep shit, will not offer so much as a suggestion of a paddle. He seems to be holding back until after he gets himself safely re-elected in November. Then he’s got a year to get that sales tax voted in and three years to make the public forget he had anything to do with it.
Well Bob, is that what you’re up to?
I’ll say, if he were at least honest, I might be able to hold my nose and support him, but this game he’s playing is a real turn-off.

Council video feed still not available – $taff seems to have taken the Summer off!
I know, there’s probably a perfectly legitimate explanation for this. Debbie Presson isn’t sure why the feed is off, but she’s got somebody working on it. Not yesterday though, cause she was out of her office.
I’ll tell you what else is interesting – there haven’t been any of those morning meetings lately – in fact, it looks like all the committee meetings for July are CANCELLED. In fact, there hasn’t been an “Economic Development” committee meeting for months that I’m aware. For all intents and purposes, the city of Chico seems to be on Summer Vacation! How nice for them!
But, as you see, the town runs along without them. In fact, I’m wishing the public works department would also take a hike – they’re TOO BUSY right now, tearing up the streets Downtown. Oh well, the college students have “gone home” – what do we need Downtown for when the college students have gone home?
That seems to be the gist of if – the city of Chico is here to serve the college students. The rest of us can just get along – as long as we keep paying our taxes, nobody will bother us!
I just have to wonder, what are these $85,000, $95,000, $134,000 $taffers doing right now, and why do we need to keep paying them?

New police chief’s contract signed last Tuesday, made available to the public Friday – gotta love that “sunshine”!
Last Tuesday night we got a new police chief – Kirk Trostle. Only a month ago city manager Dave Burkland issued a statement – “police chief candidates not knockouts” according to the Enterprise Record. Trostle is a refugee from the Oroville police department, where, as chief, he certainly had his critics. He came to Chico only about a year and a half ago, from a department that was not without it’s problems. The council made their appointment without any elaboration – he was essentially the best thing they could come up with on short notice.
But shouldn’t we be able to negotiate a better contract with this man? Retiring Chief Porky Mike Maloney is getting over $165,000 a year, just in salary. He will be getting over $100,000 to retire, for the rest of his life, plus medical benefits. Frankly, I predict he’s carrying a colostomy bag within five years.
Have you seen Trostle’s contract? They signed it at council last Tuesday. But when we asked for it, they said we wouldn’t be able to look at it until Friday. I was invited to go down to the clerk’s office, at her convenience, 9 – 5, during MY WORK DAY, to look at a contract that had already been signed. Why in the hell would I want to do that? They don’t even offer you a decent cup of coffee.
So no, I haven’t seen it yet, but I’m guessing, it’s worse than Maloney’s contract. A fellow taxpayer went down Friday and reports he has the contracts, but has not given me any details. I don’t know if he had to pay for paper copies or what, but you can view it for free if you want to go down there. I’ll get back to you when I got something.

Mary Goloff and Jim Walker gang jump Mark Sorensen on the dais – just another lovely Chico city council meeting!
I’m sitting here in disbelief of the attack I just watched Mary Goloff and Jim Walker wage on Mark Sorensen at city council tonight. I couldn’t make the meeting, so I have been watching it via computer.
Sorensen had been challenged by a smarmy Jim Walker to list what changes he would make to balance the budget. Sorensen carefully began to explain that city funds had been depleted by millions over the last few years, with escalating costs leaving revenues in the dirt. He also explained that the lion’s share of our expenses are “operating costs,” meaning, salaries. He also carefully explained that there were programs we simply could not afford anymore, meaning, salaries.
Mary Goloff could be heard heckling him off microphone. If you or I did what she was doing we’d be asked to leave the room, possibly with police escort. But Mayor Schwab just sat there looking at Goloff, saying nothing. Goloff finally got on mike, interrupted Sorensen, and asked him to be specific. So, Sorensen offered housing, saying it had been a mistake to undertake so many housing projects, and he also specified the arts programs – such as the requirement that any capital project include one percent of the total cost of that project be added for art.
At this point Goloff began to interrupt Sorensen. She started heckling him about how “we all agree” that the arts are important, yadda, yadda. She just kept at Sorensen, not allowing him to answer any of her out-there questions, until Sorensen asked her to stop interrupting him.
After a quick exchange Walker butted in to attack Sorensen. Out of nowhere, Walker bashed Sorensen about wanting to spend more money on the police department, asking Sorensen where he would get the money to hire more police. This question was off base, Sorensen hadn’t even gotten that far before Goloff had completely derailed him.
Jim Walker is just sitting out his time, he seems to be enjoying himself at all of our expense. He, like so many “public servants,” seems to think he is elected to do what he wants, what seems like “the right thing” in his fairy tale mind, instead of carry out the law.
Mary Goloff seems to think she has been anointed Queen in some farcical aquatic ceremony to lead us all in the light of her cough syrup-induced wisdom. She seems to love the sound of her own voice, while here at my house, it sets off the hounds for blocks.
My computer started failing at this point, and I was unable to watch the rest of the meeting. I am going on vacation tomorrow, I’ll see you folks on the flip flop.

Turn that S*** UP!
We had a lively discussion down at the library yesterday about how we are going to fight the phone tax increase in November.
The key here is to inform the public. $taff has already done their best to make this measure confusing and deceptive, actually writing into the measure that it will lower taxes. They mean, they are lowering the rate half a cent, but of course, this half-cent will be an ice cube in hell when they apply the tax to all the new stuff this measure allows – starting with cell phones, texting, paging, and adding whatever new technology comes along. All the voter needs to know is, this measure will raise his/her taxes, noticeably.
Even people on welfare will pay this tax, even though they qualify for the rate-assistance plans offered by the phone companies – utility tax is based on the total bill, before the adjustment for the rate assistance. And, this tax includes those prepaid phone cards.
The hardest hit will be commercial customers. A friend of mine who owns a little manufacturing business in town tells me the city of Chico thinks all business owners are “rich sugar daddies”.
My friend always tells me, that while I am in these meetings Downtown, he is in Oroville or Redding or Modesto or some other town, dealing with his business. He says these towns have better, more workable $taff. He is among the business owners who have used the word “hostile” to describe Dave Burkland, and the city business climate in general.
We have to get the word out to people like my friend that NOW IS THE TIME to get involved. I like that band, Rage Against the Machine – they say, “it has to start somewhere, it has to start sometime. What better place than here, what better time than NOW!”
We’re fighting the city, which will use public money to fund this tax increase initiative. For example, they have already used $taff time to research and write the measure, and now council members and $taff will create the “for” argument to be placed on the ballot. Our city attorney makes over $190,000 a year in salary alone – Mark Sorensen figured the cost of an hour of her time, but I forget the figure. More than most people make in a day, is all I remember.
The city will turn over their arguments in favor in August – at that point we can take this dog and pony show on the road. Until then, let’s keep working. Thanks all!
","[""Toby Schindelbeck's observation is that the police say they aren't paid enough to enforce the laws in the streets.""]",6599,multifieldqa_en,en,,3a63a9ca3248cecdeef9f43282a5162ff154b0bcdcf4ba81," Toby Schindelbeck has observed that issues like Corporate Personhood and the “single-use” plastic bag ban have drawn fairly small crowds – he estimates 25 – 30 people. Jennifer Hennessy admits she has not made such a report in the seven years she’s been with the city of Chico. We’ve got a serious law enforcement problem in our town. The police say they aren’t paid enough to enforce the laws in the streets, and now Dave Burkland says, he just doesn’n't have to. The mayor is retiring, on more than $150,000 a year, for the rest of his life, but she's up for election in November – time to take out the trash. It takes people to demand law enforcement. Try not paying your taxes for seven years – you’ll get the same treatment as the man from Touch of Class Florist – 68 years old, and he’re being sent to PRISON. I think it's time for Chico City Council to get its nose out of the political game and do its job. It's time to stop flogging the law right in front of everybody, and Ann just steps right into that little red convertible and drives off to her palatial estate in Forest Ranch. Quentin Colgan wrote that the Tea Party forced the city to have a $150,000 election over Measure A. The City Council chose the method by which the election would be held. Colgan’s argument doesn’t make sense to me, but it's amazing what kind of “facts” the general populace will believe if you just keep repeating them. Some people can try to run their little smokescreen of repetitive nonsense, but more rational people are finding out the truth. Stephanie Taber has followed this budget conversation since the day then-city-manager and first rat to jump, Greg Jones, expressed his grave concerns that we were headed straight for bankruptcy. She has followed the figures and checked the facts until she has forced these rats right to the wall – they have lately begun to dig their feet in and refuse to obey the sunshine laws, refusing to give the fiscal reports demanded by the city charter. They refuse to have rational discussion about the situation we’re facing, because it's going to mean some sour beans for them and their trough-dwelling friends. It's up to a rational person like StephanieTaber to lay it out straight for those who like facts. City Art Director Mary Gardner is foisting a new “Art Tax’ on us to pay her own salary. The Chico Taxpayers Association will fight this grab, as will other civic groups through the area. Nobody wants eggsuckers like you telling them how to spend their money or what’s “art”. You people need to get real jobs and quit sucking off the public teat. You make me sick. I’ll never forget my first real job – a clerical position at a manufacturing plant. It was a disaster. I would compare it to the story of the miller's daughter. I was told that the employee I was to be replacing would stick around for a week to train me. At noon that day, having shown me where everything was and how to use the coffee maker, she got up from her chair, smiled, and told me she thought I could “handle it,” then left. At 1 o’clock, the plant manager came over to my desk followed by several “production” workers. They brought cart loads of microfilm, on rolls, in little white boxes. They were piled high. This job had gotten held up, he explained, it would be “great!” if it could go out today. Did I think I could get them done by 4 o'clock? I wanted to make everybody happy, so said yes. Mary Mary: I keep waiting for some professional behavior, some professional accountability out of the people who run our town. For a couple of months now, council members have been asking council and Finance MisDirector Jennifer Hennessy to provide a simple accounting of city finances. She just plain refuses to give it. City Mangler Dave Burkland won’t make her do it. She admitted that she is incompetent to follow the city charter. She said that when she came to her position seven years ago, she “struggled” with doing such a report – something every house wife does – and went whining to then-city-manager Tom Lando, who apparently patted her on the head and told her she didn't have to do it anymore. I’m no math instructor, like Mary Goloff, but it’s not exactly rocket science – you just add your deposits and subtract your checks. I admit, when my kids were little, I felt like I never had time to do that and stuff would get screwed up. So now, I make it regularly scheduled, and it's amazing how much easier it is. And, I can keep the figures in my head, I kn kn’ve got that. The city of Chico, California has less than $200,000 in the reserve fund. Over 80 percent of the city's budget is in salaries and benefits. The city has un-secured pension obligations totaling in the millions. A lot of distasteful things become “common” when no decent person stands up to say “enough is enough.” The mayor is to blame here, she’s the captain of our ship. Unfortunately, like the. captain of the Costa Concordia, she's abandoned ship for a party onshore. The mayor won’t give the report she's required to give because it's BAD. I think the mayor is completely behind her on this – Ann Schwab doesn't want us to hear that report either. Would you?Please write a letter to council demanding that Hennessy do her job, or get out. You can look at the budget report here. Read it and weep – and then call them to ask what they did with that property tax check you just sent in. You see the millions the city takes in, in sales tax (over $17 million) property tax ( over $11 million), even taxes on your PG&E, phone and water (almost $7 million) and your visitors’ motel rooms (over. $2 million) The city just slammed another cop contract past us without public review, and signed the new chief’s contract three days before it was made available to the public. While our elected leaders frolic and cavort in their stupid committee meetings, the Chamber is working on a “Top 10 Economic Development Action List” One of their ‘Top 10’ is a proposal to raise the local sales tax. Marysville Mayor Bill Harris had no trouble making himself clear when his city mangler proposed a half-cent sales tax increase: “This will be viewed as the City Council coming to them wanting more money again.” The only council member who supported the proposal was the retiring city administrator, but nobody mentions that. The mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania, when faced with a situation similar to Chico's mess, did what needed to be done. Unfortunately, he waited until it was too late to do something rational. I’m afraid it's come to that with our city council – if you think that scene between Goloff and Sorensen was rational, well, you deserve to live here. I want to believe Bob is a ‘fiscal conservative.’ After all, he had some high and mighty things to say about his opposition to the phone tax. Head Start administrator Ricky Samayoa made some disparaging remarks about the town. Ann Schwab: Samoyoa has the same problem Chico has – too many $100,000+ salaries and not enough $20,000 – $50,000 workers. “The way we’re continuing to go, it’s just going to be a dying city, even if the economy picks up,” he said. This is a typical example of scare tactics, says Schwab. The only member of Chico City Council who is willing to discuss this proposal at all has been Mark Sorensen – thanks Mark. Bob Evans and Andy Holcombe have both denied knowing anything about it, although Holcombe has made it good and clear he’d support raising the sales tax and Evans has been seen at Chamber discussions on the matter. The others have been mum to the public, but I’m guessing they will support it. Bob, I say, if he were honest, I might be able to hold my nose and support him but this game is a real turn-off. Ann. Schwab for Chico city council, Bob Evans for city council,. Ann Schwalb for city Council, Bob. Evans for council, Ann Schwelb for council. Council video feed still not available – $taff seems to have taken the Summer off. New police chief’s contract signed last Tuesday, made available to the public Friday – gotta love that “sunshine”! Retiring Chief Porky Mike Maloney is getting over $165,000 a year, just in salary. Public works department also taking a hike – they’re TOO BUSY right now, tearing up the streets Downtown.

I’m guessing, it’ll be worse than Maloney”s contract. A fellow taxpayer went down Friday and reports he has the contracts, but has not given me any details. I don’t know if he had to pay for paper copies or what, but you can view it for free if you want to go down there. Mary Goloff heckled Chico Mayor Ann Schwab at a city council meeting. Schwab is fighting a half-cent tax increase on cell phones, texting and paging. Goloff interrupted Sorensen when he said the city could not afford to pay his salaries. Chico City Councilman Jim Walker then attacked the mayor for wanting to spend more money on the police department. The tax will go to the city's general fund, which will be used to research and write the city’s new $taff plan. The city is trying to confuse the public by saying the tax will lower taxes, but it will be an ice cube in hell when they apply the tax to all the new stuff this measure allows – starting with cell phones and texting, paging, and adding whatever new technology comes along. We have to get the word out to people like my friend Dave Burkland, that NOW is the time to get involved.

Who is the program chair of this conference?,"HOFFMAN: I'm delighted to introduce the chair of the last session, Mara Liasson from the National Public Radio. Mara is Congressional correspondent for NPR, and covers activities in Congress in D.C. Right now, this week, she has been covering the tax bill, which people currently are going at hot and heavy. She took time off from her busy schedule to come here to help us sort out some of these key issues for today, and more importantly, for what happens in the next decade and beyond. I'll turn it over to Mara to get the panel going.
LIASSON: Thank you very much. I am probably the only person here who has absolutely no background in technology. Anyway, I am the only one who does not understand what the panelists are going to be talking about (laughter), and although they have already told me that they do not appreciate people who think that that's a great quality and look down on people who are technical, and I certainly do not, I will reserve the right to insist that they all talk in terms that people like me can understand, since there is more of me out there than you, although not in this room today. (laughter) What we are going to do is introduce each panelist, and each one will make a short three- to five-minute presentation. Then my instructions say that we are going to have a McLaughlin Group discussion, which I guess means lots of yelling and screaming and talking at once. (laughter) After that's over, about 4:10, we'll open up the panel for questions from the audience.
To my left is Peter Denning, who is Chairman of the Computer Science Department at George Mason University and also the associate dean for computing. He is the program chair of this conference, has also served as the president of ACM, and he is currently the editor of Communications.
Simon Davies, to my right, also wears blue suits, but you can tell him from Mitch, because he wears a white hat. (laughter) He is from Sydney, Australia, and is the Director General of Privacy International, which is an international network of privacy advocates. He is also an author, a journalist, and radio commentator.
To his right is Roland Homet. He is an information policy writer and thinker who recently opened his own public policy writing firm here in Washington -- it's called Executive Ink, not Inc., as it is written in your programs, so you can scratch that out.
Esther Dyson, at the end of the panel, is among the most respected commentators on developing technology trends in the personal computer business. She publishes two newsletters, Release 1.0 and Rel-EAST. She has also been one of the driving forces promoting East-West relations through computer networks. She is a board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation as well.
I'll ask Peter to start.
P. DENNING: Thank you. Starting around 1850, people of many countries looked to their governments to regulate commerce, erase inequities, and build societies of better human beings. For over a hundred years, many people, from peasants to intellectuals, had faith that strong governments would bring them a better life. This faith was part of the clearing in which Communist governments flourished; although the United States took an anti-Communist stand, the same faith fostered a strong government that promised salvation by great national programs including Social Security, welfare, food stamps, the War on Poverty, and the Great Society. This faith is now shattered. People no longer trust that powerful government can deliver a better life.
The dramatic collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union illustrates this, as does the growing disillusionment of the American people for federal, state, and local governments. The poor track record of government is not the only reason for the shift. Information technology has accelerated the process. Communications that took weeks in the last century now take fractions of a second. Business success depends on what happens around the globe, not only on local conditions. Radio, TV, fax, and now E-mail are common worldwide, so much so that not even a powerful government can control what information its citizens have. Because the space of opportunity for people to engage in transactions with each other has been so enormously enlarged during the past decade, faith in marketplace democracies is on the rise worldwide; correspondingly faith in central management mechanisms is on the decline. This shift has brought with it a shift of the power of institutions. Government institutions tend to try to hold onto their power by regulatory coercion to enforce the old ways. This can produce big tensions and even promote breakage.
Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the cryptographic area which we have just been talking about in the previous hour. This technology, cryptography, produces mechanisms for digital signatures, authentication, electronic money, certificates, and private communication -- all offering a way for standard business practices now based on paper to be shifted into the electronic media. The success of worldwide enterprises depends on this shift being completed rapidly and effectively. As more people realize this, the momentum for incorporating cryptographic technology into the information infrastructure is accelerating.
In this country, the National Security Agency has long been given the authority to regulate cryptography. This authority was granted in another time when the success of the country depended upon the ability of its government to gather intelligence and communicate in secret. These premises made sense in a world where most of the power resided in governments, but the world is changing. Much economic power is now accumulating in large apolitical transnational corporations. These corporations place their own concerns and strategies ahead of those of governments of the countries in which they do business. Like governments, they are interested in gathering intelligence about competitors and in conducting business in private. Unlike governments, they want open access to the technologies of authentication, electronic money, digital signatures, and certificates that will allow them to conduct business transactions across the network. So it is no longer true that national power and national security are increased when government has the sole right to gather intelligence and encipher communications. Now the strength of a country depends not only on its government, but also on its corporations. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage.
Well, digital media -- computer-based communications -- are the printing press of the 21st century, and as the printing press transformed society, created the modern individual, gave rise to the basis of the democratic state and to the notion of individual rights, I suspect that we will see a similar, radical transformation of the very constitution of global society in the next century, facilitated by this enabling technology. I would be the last person to try to sketch out the details, or tell you what the issues are going to be, but I want to share with you some feelings about what is really going to matter, as we go about this -- and I'll start with something about myself.
You see a guy wearing a suit; most of you know I have a lot of money -- I'm a successful businessman. God knows what images propagate around the media and settle in people's minds, but I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsider, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider, as Tom Jennings -- who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards* yesterday -- was. *The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference.
I think we are all outsiders; we are all different, all unique. We're not the same. We share an underlying common humanity, but we should not be asked to subjugate ourselves to some form of mass society that causes us each to become indistinguishable from one another. I believe that computer- based communications technology is an enabling technology to liberate individuals and to free us from the oppressive influence of large institutions, whether those are public or private. And I am talking about an economic restructuring that results in a much more decentralized society, and social restructuring in an affirmation of the simple right to be left alone. I think Cyberspace is good for individuals, and I think that's important. I also think that the flip side of the coin, the creation of community, which we so sorely lack in this country today, can be facilitated through these technologies.
I have experienced that for myself, as many of you have on your various computer networks on conferencing systems like the WELL. It is enormously liberating to overcome the artificial boundaries of space and time. We are prisoners of geography in the physical world, and our communities are largely a product of who we can see face to face each day, even though our real comrades and colleagues may be scattered all over the world and our interests -- whether they are hobbies or political interests or religious interests, whatever they might be -- can be facilitated if we are able to get in touch with, to form bonds with, to exchange views and ideas with other kindred spirits. And I believe this technology is an enabling technology for the formation of community. My hope is that we will have the wisdom to create policies which enable individuals to flourish free from the chains of mass society, and which enable voluntary communities of people, individuals, groups who come together to be with each other and to work together. I hope both of those become possible.
DAVIES: I feel very warmed by the various visions of the future that have come out of this conference, but I am a cynic, and cynicism is good, because it adds fiber. (laughter) How nice the world would be if everyone was like Mitch, but they're not, because the future is in the hands of ruthless, greedy little men.
I want to paint the vision of the future that I have, and I hope it's not too depressing because there is a future, a good future... possibly. I agree, as many of you do, that the future is going to be like some giant informational Yggdrasil* *Reference from Old Norse mythology -- the Yggdrasil was a giant ash tree whose roots held together the universe.. We'll all be part of interconnectivity, the likes of which we can scarcely imagine right now. I imagine it will be like an organism where we're independent and interdependent, and so it's like a two-edged sword. That's all very nice, and we can see that we form part of that new community. But, I see a world with 15 billion beings scrambling for life, where four-fifths of the world lives on half a liter of water a day, where people grow up to see their children dying, where new political frontiers are destroying freedoms and the democracy that we have developed over the last two centuries. I see a world where there is very little hope for nearly everybody on the planet, except for the elite -- that's us -- except for those of us who are plugged into the informational Yggdrasil.
What I see is that 14 of those 15 billion people are a lot of pissed-off people who have their eyes set on what they see, not as a wonderful informational community, but as the beast. And they see that that is where the resources are, and that's where the opportunities are, and that's where the political power is. I can't see a future for us in a world where ultimately the great demon becomes information. It might be good for us, but for the disaffected four-fifths of the world, information is going to be something which, frankly, we can do without, because in a world with almost no resources left, surely information is selfishness.
HOMET: Thank you. I'm grateful to the organizers for including me in these proceedings -- they are reminiscent for me of some information policy conferences that I organized 15 to 20 years ago for the Aspen Institute. The particulars have certainly changed, but the dynamics remain much the same. For me, these are well-represented by Peter Denning's image of a changeable clearing in the woods. At any given time, as I see it, the clearing is an acceptable standoff between the forces of modernization and of traditional culture, between freedom and discipline, between structure and spontaneity. Now we voice these as opposites, but in fact, they need each other. It is the creative tension between technological innovation and established order that allows society to hold together and progress to take place. Take away freedom and order will be overthrown -- witness the Soviet Union. Take away tradition, and modernization will be crushed -- witness Iran. The clearing must be respected and it must move. Just as Benjamin Cardozo of the U.S. Supreme Court said 65 years ago, the genius of the American system is its penchant for ordered liberty. When both halves of the equation work against each other and together in Hegelian terms, the clearing that they produce is, at any given time, a prevailing hypothesis, which is challenged by a new antithesis. Together they can produce a fresh synthesis. And all that is very familiar. What is new and trying is the sweep and pace of innovation today, plus -- and this is what we sometimes forget -- the political volatility of the value systems that this can induce. If you doubt that, consider the Buchanan campaign and what's been going on with the Endowment for the Arts and public broadcasting. These are signs of people running scared, and they can cause damage.
So the answer for the 21st century is to proceed under power, but with restraint, to practice what Mitch Kapor in another connection called toleration for opposing forces and perspectives. We need each other to keep the enterprise together and on course. For computer practitioners represented in this room, this means restraint from provoking unnecessary and damaging social backlash. A good example might be New York telcos offering free per-call and per-line blocking with this caller identification service. For regulators and law enforcers, restraint means asking, ""Do you know enough to freeze emerging conduct in a particular form or pattern?"" I was very taken by the role reversal exercise organized by Michael Gibbons on Wednesday night. It led me to wonder what might have happened to the government's wiretapping and encryption proposals had they been subjected to a comparable advanced exercise before introduction.
Sixteen years ago in Aspen, Colorado, I convened a gathering of federal policymakers and invited them to consider a suggested matrix of policy values and processes in the information society. The first two of those values -- it will not surprise you to know -- were freedom of discourse and individual privacy. But there were more: freedom of economic choice is one; the general welfare another; popular sovereignty, worth pausing on, I described as avoiding concentrations of economic and political power in any sector of industry or government that impinge unduly on the freedoms or welfare of the citizenry. And then there is progress, social progress, the fostering, I said, of market incentives and opportunities for technological and service innovations and for widened consumer choice among technologies and services. Now obviously if you give just a moment's thought to it, you will recognize, as I think we have in this conference, that these values can collide with each other at key points, and therefore accommodations must be made. For that we need processes of accommodation. I also suggested some of those. After you identify the relevant values and goals, you then should ask yourself about the necessity and the appropriateness of having government make any decision on the matter. And this has to do with such things like the adequacy of decision-making standards, the availability of adequate information, and the adequacy of personnel resources to deal with it. Then you get into dividing up the possible roles of the various elements of government -- the regulatory agencies, the Executive Branch, the Judiciary, and the Congress. It doesn't stop there, because you need to ask about international implications, which we have done some of here. And federal/state implications -- very often allowing the state to make a stab at social ordering in the first instance is, as Justice Brandeis often said, the best way, through the social laboratory technique, to try out what is the right answer, without endangering the whole society. And as we have heard today, we need also to think about the availability of non-coercive instruments of accommodation, like a federal data protection board.
DYSON: I want to just say one thing about this business of crypto technology -- it is a very simple sentence, and everyone seems to slip slightly by it; that is, if you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns. Crypto technology is fundamentally a defensive weapon. It may protect murderers and thieves, but it is not a weapon that murders, kills, does anything bad; and so it is a very different kettle of fish from any other kind of weapon. The whole point is that information is powerful, and that the free flow of information, privacy-protected, empowers the powerless and is dangerous to the powerful -- and that's why we need our privacy protected.
Now let me just talk a wee bit about the future. A couple of days ago, a reporter called me and asked what the EFF stood for. I kind of floundered around and said, ""Well, we want privacy, we want good hackers to be protected and bad crackers to be punished. We want people to understand the difference, and we want all these good things, but we really don't want to grab power."" The guy kept on not quite getting it. The real answers were pro choice. We don't want someone else to make all these decisions for anybody. We don't even want the majority to rule. In every way that is possible, we want the minorities to control their own conditions in their own lives. There are very few things that are the province of government, but way too many things nowadays are being given to the government carelessly, fearfully, whatever. In my terms -- and I happen to be a right-wing person in terms of the economy and private freedoms -- I want more markets and fewer governments. Markets give choices to individuals. They let people trade what they don't want for what they do want. Again, to the extent possible, they want people to make individual choices.
What worries me is large concentrations of power, making choices for people. Big business, big government, even big media. The media until now have mostly been our protectors, because they go out and produce information, they use anonymous sources where necessary, and they make that information free. What protected global networking is going to do is give more and more of that power to individuals, and help reduce the power of big institutions of any kind. We are going to have small businesses flourishing, because it is easier for them to collect resources. You don't need to have a giant monolithic corporation to be efficient any more, and so a lot of marketplace economies of scale will even disappear, as we have better networking, better coordination. We have markets like the American Information Exchange, and if you don't know what that is, come and see me, or Hugh Daniel, or a couple of other people.
On the social side, I think 20 years ago... when you mentioned 15 years ago, I thought, Yes, that must have been about 1940. Then I realized... Anyway, some time ago there was all this talk about the global village. We're going to have mass broadcasting, we're going to have mass E-mail, we're going to have this global village. We don't. What we have is a lot of global villages, but as Mitch said, they're no longer geographical, physical villages. They're small, geographical villages of people with like interests. The big question becomes, How do we avert tribalism? It might not be nation against nation any more, but it certainly will be rich against poor, and franchised versus disenfranchised.
LIASSON: Thank you all very much. Now we can all try to stir up the pot a little bit. Somewhere between Mitch's paradise and the Simon's apocalypse is probably what's really going to happen. I want to just jump off from what Esther said about you all being in a minority and what kind of responsibility you owe to the rest of the world. We're in the midst of a presidential election and not one single candidate has said anything about Cyberspace. I am wondering if you think they should, and what are the kinds of extremely important issues that you think should be discussed? Should they be discussed in a kind of mass, political forum? Or should they be left to an elite like you to discuss and decide, and not really spend a whole lot of energy trying to translate or disseminate them to the great masses of people? I guess what I am wondering is, if you were an advisor to one of the presidential candidates, or a candidate yourself, how would you go about interjecting these things? Or wouldn't you bother at all?
DYSON: Does he want to get elected, or does he want to make a point?
LIASSON: I think he wants to make a point. If he wants to get elected, I think the discussion would stop right now.
DYSON: Let me just try a serious answer. I think what a candidate could say is, ""I'm no longer going to protect the textile industry, the peanut butter interests, the sugar guys, the antediluvian steel mills. If I'm going to have an industrial policy and help anyone, it's going to be new technology. I'm going to focus on investment in R&D. I am going to create a national infrastructure for telecommunications, just the way we created a highway system years ago. I'm going to put people to work doing these things."" I think that would go over reasonably well. I think it's something most of us would agree on. (laughter) We have an industrial policy -- we might as well acknowledge it, and we might as well have it be forward-looking.
KAPOR: Now there is something about the question as to whether this is presidential material that I think is ironic, given that most people really want to vote for ""none of the above."" We know in our hearts that we have come to a particular period in history in which the presidential spectacle seems to be particularly irrelevant to whatever set of problems we have on our minds. As a great believer in democracy, I think this is incredibly lamentable. We need to do something about this, because there are a lot of issues, but Cyberspace is not ready for prime time. It would be trivialized -- I have seen what Geraldo did to hackers, and I don't need to see any more.
It seems to me that the presidential candidates are really not the leaders that they ought to be, but are always putting their finger to the wind to see if they can detect some current of values or beliefs that can help get them elected. And I think that -- I'm not espousing utopian vision -- there needs to be an utopian vision out there, so people have something to give them some inspiration. But values are a lot more important than technology. There are some values in this community -- and I'm not sure if it's an elite or a minority or both -- but it's really in the propagation of a sense of values about openness and tolerance, acting on that basis and living one's life, and saving capitalism from itself and things like that where we can make a difference. If some of the expressions are technological, that's fine. We are living in an era where people like buttons, and so on. If we do that well, the presidential candidates are going to be coming to us.
LIASSON: You talk about Cyberspace not being ready for prime time -- I still want a definition of Cyberspace in 25 words or less -- but I think you want to transform prime time to a certain extent.
DYSON: Mostly I agree with this, but the press does have two roles: one is collecting information and uncovering things, and the other is setting the agenda. If 12,000 voices are crying out, who's going to listen to them? Who's going to notice when they do discover that the President did something wrong? Again, it's a check and balance sort of thing, but there is a certain community that is created by collective media.
KAPOR: Esther, what makes you believe that in Cyberspace Mara won't have two hours a day of her own that everyone listens to. (laughter) She might get more time than she gets today, because people trust her.
DYSON: But then she becomes prime time.
LIASSON: But you said before that instead of one global village, we have a lot of little global villages. I'm wondering if instead, we won't have millions of little huts. I mean individual huts. There are just so many different choices.
LIASSON: What I'm wondering is, if everybody becomes their own producer, publisher, what does that mean for the future?
KAPOR: I think we'll get a much more fluid, self-organizing state. I don't think in practice everybody is going to be what we think of today as a broadcast publisher. I just want things to be able to sort themselves out in a much more equitable fashion. We have this enormous, artificial scarcity today over the means of communication, because the government awards licenses which self-perpetuate. They are about to do the same thing, and give every broadcast television station another license for HDTV. So if you've got a license today, you get a second one; if you don't have one, you get nothing. That is going to be our policy about HDTV. I think it would be a lot better if we had more markets, more choices, and better values. I don't know how to do better values, but we know how to do more choices. So the point is, we'll wind up with some new regime which I don't think that we can particularly predict. I don't think that it is going to be chaotic or anarchic. I think there is something about people as social animals or creatures -- we will create some new forms of social organization. There will be information middlemen; there will be the equivalent of editors and packagers. There will be trusted intermediaries who help organize these new media. If you open it up and equalize things so that everybody can participate, you will get more diversity of points of view, you will get less homogenization. One of the reasons that tons of people have just dropped out, or are in terminal couch-potato-dom is that the sets of choices and the values that come across the tube are not ones that stir the human heart. And people know that. They can't figure out what to do about that, so they sort of fuzz out on drugs and alcohol. I say let's edit TV, which is the electronic drug. Let's do something about that.
DAVIES: I like your idea, Mitch. I think it's sweet. (laughter) The problem is that I really worry that the ultimate test of the future is going to be the outcome of the quest, the battle between those who are looking for the sort of vision you've got of the right of the individual, the individual being the producer. And that, probably, is the way we solve our problems on this planet. But there is the other side, and that's the planetary managers. Planetary management is the path of the least resistance. You know all the powermongers go for the planetary management model, because they all think they can clamber over the bodies to get to the top. Ultimately the test is going to be who comes out on the top, the individual rightist or the planetary managers. Unfortunately, I'm not a betting man, but at the moment I'd like to bet on the planetary managers.
DYSON: Part of this issue is reducing the value of incumbency, whether it's incumbency in prime time live, or incumbency in the government. There is much more fluidity of movement; you can't accumulate power because the unorganized forces have more power than you do.
P. DENNING: I feel a little strange being on the left end of the stage, because most people think of me as being on the far right sometimes, but right now I'd like to comment on something that is halfway between what Mitch is saying, and what Simon is saying. The way I hear what Simon is saying, is that there is a disease of today which I will call inward- centeredness. We are very worried about ourselves and our organizations. We find in that orientation a lot of instability of things and technologies that change rapidly. In order to achieve the world that Mitch is talking about, we need to cure the disease, and instead come from an orientation that we could call outward-centeredness, instead of inward-centeredness. The question is the shift from, How do we accumulate power? to, How do we help others accumulate power? How do we go from looking for stability in things to looking for stability in relationships? In watching my own children grow up, I am convinced that they know more about this than I do. In listening to some of the younger people here, I'm more convinced that they know more about this than I do. They know something about the outward-centeredness that I have yet to learn. Observing this among children and among students gives me a lot of optimism, as a matter of fact, against the apocalypse that Simon talks about, because Simon is talking about the world that would be created if we continued ""us,"" and I think that the world that is being created by our children with their outward-centeredness is going to be the kind of world that Mitch is pointing towards. And I am much more optimistic about that than Simon is.
LIASSON: Roland, I wonder if we can interject you into this discussion a little bit. You have been a policymaker. What can be done to make sure that Simon's vision doesn't come true, and something a little closer to what Esther and Mitch describe does happen?
HOMET: I think we probably need both doom seers and paradise seekers. We'll always have them, and we should have them. It's between the swing of those two views that things happen. I think that this notion of replacing the gatekeepers and letting everybody perform his own dance, to the amusement of those who chose to tune in, is one that many of us were promoting 20 years ago. That's not 1940 -- that's 1970 (laughter), and we were quite convinced that was likely to happen by the end of that decade. Now it's 12 years beyond the end of that decade, and we're nowhere near having that happening. We just have newly-named controversies, and so, as you heard me say in my little short remark, I think that our objective ought to be more modest, and that is to keep the questions open, not let them be foreclosed -- certainly not prematurely, and not on the basis of inadequate evidence. I would say something about the apocalyptic view, which is, I think there is a difference between information policy questions and welfare questions. The poor we have always with us, as somebody once said, and whether information, Cyberspace -- whatever you want to call it -- is promoted or not, that is true. It may become more glaringly true in an advanced information society, in which case, more may be done about it. So I wouldn't despair about that, and I wouldn't hold back on the development of instruments of interconnection simply because we can see that there is and will remain an underclass. Perhaps if we do the one, we'll be better equipped to do the other.
LIASSON: In just a minute or two, we're going to open this up to your questions, but I want to try to end maybe with a discussion of something quite specific, which is, Who should own the new infrastructure and information systems? Should they be publicly owned? There are lots of conflicts even within the vision that you lay out.
KAPOR: The first point I'd make is let's not make the unnecessary mistake of betting on a single infrastructure. Technologically, we don't need to do that. In the 1930s, pre-digital, the old Bell system was the social contract. You get a monopoly, you have an obligation to provide universal service. We've learned a few things about how to do things with interoperable standards and how to interconnect multiple, independent providers and carriers. One of the fathers of the Internet, Vint Cerf, is sitting here in the front row, and he deserves an enormous amount of credit for insisting on this vision and promulgating it. A lot of the risks that come with private ownership of infrastructure go away when it's no longer a monopoly. The abusive problems that are sometimes experienced with local phone service and cable companies -- both of which are private sector monopolies -- I would say come more from not their private sector character, but from their monopoly character. If it is possible for there to be competition, that serves as the most effective check that we know of in this society against abuse. So I would opt for private infrastructure, but lots of it. Government has to make sure that everybody stays interconnected -- it's the referee that keeps the playing field level, doesn't let people cheat, and sort of bangs a few heads together when people get a little too greedy, or a little too selfish. If we do that, that will provide for the most choice and the most diversity.
LIASSON: Are we all in agreement on that?
HOMET: Not entirely. I think the question is less who should own infrastructure than how it should be classified. There may be a role for government in, for example, extending communication pipes to rural America for at least a period, as with the TVA. We have always had that question. There has always been a mixed economy with government doing some things and private sector others. It's a debate and should be a debate about who does what best. It should be revised from time to time, but the important question is, If we get a significant distribution system like cable television, how should we classify it? I speak here from the heart, because 20 years ago, I was trying to fasten onto, or gain the recognition for, cable as a broadband distribution system which was only trivially in the program production and publishing business, but was very much in the distribution business and ought to have been treated as a common carrier open to all information suppliers. Had that happened, we would have been very much further along in the vision that some of us had 20 years ago. (applause) It tends to support what I said about not going in for premature freezing or characterization of how things look. It was decided, because the broadcasters felt threatened, to treat cable as a species of broadcasting. That's the greatest frittering away of resources in my lifetime, and perhaps in the lifetime of the United States of America. Let's not make that mistake again. Let's be clear-eyed and ask the broad-scale questions about public use and benefit. Thank you.
LIASSON: Let's open it up to the audience. If you have any questions ... oh my God, wrestle your way to the microphone!
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Let us not forget the history of the commons in which a wealthy society creates in its overflowing abundance structures on which all people can participate. This was originally, back in medieval society, the structure that was created for the support of the poor. In the abundance of the land in which the overpopulation was not a question, and there was much agriculture to go around, and the poor were supported out of the commonly-owned things that were jointly owned by all society. That's all I have to say.
LIASSON: Who wants to start?
DAVIES: Sticking to my apocalyptic vision just for the moment, because that's how I'm characterized, what I would like to see, just as my own social experiment, if you like, is for the various groups that this room represents and groups that you are all involved in, is to actually set up the apocalyptic vision, and then see how you as part of the information technology community can utilize it, stop it, or reverse it. It's only when you see the vision and see your own part in it that we are actually going to set up solutions. I mean, that is a straight, outright homework assignment, and I think would be a great benefit for everybody. Then go on and publish them through the E-mail, or the Internet, whatever.
DYSON: Something along the lines of go find the most influential person you know well enough to influence, who you do not agree with -- assuming that you all agree with me, of course -- and attempt to win that person over to your point of view. In other words, don't stick to your own community. Don't just talk to the people who only agree with you. Go out and evangelize or proselytize to people who don't understand what this stuff is about. Do it in such a way that you are not superior or offputting; don't try to be right; try to win and expand this community, not in terms of pressure or rightness, but in terms of understanding what we are about. The biggest problem is ganging up on some of these politicians and having them think that this stuff is not cute, or weird, or colorful, or irrelevant, but incredibly important. Make the rest of the world know about us.
HOMET: I would like to second that motion. The story is told that when a beautiful woman comes out on a street in Paris, every man within eyeshot becomes in that instant much more intensively himself. (laughter) What I would suggest to you, if you are energized by this subject, is to be yourself. To thine own self be true, and perhaps to add to that the biblical admonition to the apostles -- if I remember it correctly -- and this picks up what Esther was saying -- to be wise as snakes, and cunning as foxes. Go out there to persuade.
P. DENNING: I'd like to add to that. It is not only within yourself that you have to look, it's within others. Don't assume that you know the answers, but go talk to people. Don't just talk to us, because we already know what ""us"" has to say, but go to talk to people that we haven't talked to and find out what concerns them.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, my name is Lou Woleneck. I'm from the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. I'm a graduate student. I have a question, a general policy question, about how we should go about providing the information resources to the have-nots that the information elites have access to now. What sort of strategy that you all would have for that?
KAPOR: A 30-second or less answer, which is to set a national policy that updates a universal service for the 21st century that says everybody needs to have basic minimal access to a digital platform that reaches into every home, into every office and school in the country. We should focus our attention on how to put in place the least expensive amount of infrastructure that will produce that. What we find is, if we do that, then the overwhelming majority of American families will find it already within their budget to be able to do that, because it will be priced like basic phone service. To the extent that we need to continue or even slightly expand the kinds of lifeline programs that subsidize today's basic voice telephone service for a small percentage of the population, we should be prepared to renew that commitment. We don't need to bankrupt ourselves to give everybody access to a digital platform.
JIM WARREN: My name is Jim Warren. Two quick observations: there were several cynical comments during the last several days about a number of IRS people being here. It turns out, because they never had a platform to say this, that the whole crowd from the IRS who are here, as I understand it, are from the IRS privacy project, intent on developing policies to assure privacy protection for taxpayer information. So let us not be so cynical about their being here; otherwise, remember that they are simply doing what they are told to do by our representatives. (laughter and hisses) I was also bothered by both Simon's, and (my God!) Esther's comments on those evil little men, and the men in politics, etc. Gee, this is a modern age, let's say ""men and women,"" for evil deeds, as well as good deeds.
DYSON: There aren't enough women in politics for there to be any evil ones.
WARREN: Well, I am sure that I can find some evil ones for you. (laughter) Anyway, to the main points: I would say that we are not so much elite, in that we are open to anyone who takes the initiative to join us, and many of us are active mentors in trying to get others to join us. I would say simply that we are a minority, and it occurs to me that revolution has always been a minority activity. It was not millions of Russians who opposed the attempted coup several months ago. It was ten, twenty, or thirty thousand in Moscow, with the aid of communications. It was not a massive movement, a populist movement, in America that resisted the Crown, two centuries ago. It was a small minority of activists and we are the activists here -- we are the revolutionaries. Freedom has always been a do-it-yourself activity, but the key syllable in that word activity is act. Let us reaffirm freedom of speech, press, assembly, security against undue search and seizure -- the basic constitutional freedoms and privileges. Let us demand that our politicians and our political candidates do the same in explicit formal commitments to act in behalf of protecting electronic civil liberties, just as they validate and speak favorably for traditional civil liberties. We can write our politicians, write our candidates and say, ""Take a position in favor of civil liberties, regardless of the technology of the moment."" Thank you.
GLENN TENNEY: Thank you for the introduction, Jim.
LIASSON: Are you from the IRS?
TENNEY: No. (laughter) My name is Glenn Tenney, and I have a question for you, Mara. I think that I have enough supporters on the panel. I'm not too curious about their views, but they are welcome to them. You questioned if the presidential election and race is ready for Cyberspace. What about Congress? I'm running for Congress -- is it ready for me?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Ms. Liasson, I believe that you have opened a can of worms called politics for this little hacker community. You certainly have with me in your comment about asking for comments for the Cyberspace era from presidential candidates. I have very strong reactions to that. I think that I am going to try to express them, as a pure statement, or maybe an actual story. Several years ago, I was discussing with a friend of mine the current presidential, the then-current presidential election. He was asking me why I wasn't rabidly supporting Jesse Jackson. I thought about it, and my first response was, ""Well, let's talk about the other candidates for a second. What about -- and I'll take a random name -- Michael Dukakis?"" And my friend looked at me and said, ""Michael Dukakis, he's just an administrator, he's not a visionary."" I thought about it, and I said, ""Hold on, I'm an American, I'm not someone who's a slave of the Queen of England, or something like that. I'm my own visionary, I decide where I am going."" I don't want the politicians walking around telling me that I am going to have an expressway system that's going to pave over all my favorite swamps to play in. I don't want the politicians walking around defining what I'm going to do in my life. I want to elect politicians to manage government for me, to provide the barest minimum necessities to keep us smoothly greased as individuals in living together, and I want those politicians to be of the people, and I don't want them to tell me what my opinions should be. Finally, I want to cap that off with when we have government deciding how our systems work for us, we can then end up with situations where we can say, ""Oh yeah, that IRS guy or that government net guy, he was just doing his job when he banned cryptography,"" or something like that. That's not the sort of world that I want to live in. I want to live in a world, where each of us defines our little space in it. Thank you all.
LIASSON: I think we have time for just two more and then we'll have to wrap it up.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, to the apocalypse types. I'd like to say just one thing that somebody said: The truth will make you free. In that this technology is a vehicle of communication, I believe that it is a vehicle of the truth, and as long as we keep it free, the truth will be heard that much more. Now I have kind of a question with a bit of a statement. I am a learning-disabled college student. I didn't ever finish high school. I had a freshmen education in high school, because of educational problems, and adjustment problems, I never really got too far beyond that. I write probably a fifth of the speed of anyone in this room and I have a real hard time doing math without a calculator. That's part of the reason why I wasn't able to do well in school. I read very well, fortunately, so I was able to go in when I was eighteen and take my GED just flat out without studying for it. I'm not dumb, or uneducated by any standards, but what has allowed me to get an associate's degree in college, and what has allowed me to approach graduation and get a bachelor's degree in college is the kind of technology that we are dealing with. I have never had easy access to that technology. The barriers that I have faced have been ones of order, regimentation, and where people try and say, ""Oh well, you don't fit in, you're not a CS student, you don't need those resources."" I'm good with computers, I do a lot with them, I spend a lot of time with them. I hack, I don't do anything illegal, but I took a hacksaw to the frame of my nasty little 8088 about two years ago to cram some RAM into it, because that was the only way I could get it to fit and I needed it. Now I'm in a little bit better shape. I'm approaching the point where I would like to see ISDN real soon, because I need that kind of connectivity. You know, I'm doing interesting things that I find absolutely wonderful, but the idea that the kind of technology that is available to us, that is just there for the using, could be limited and unavailable to people, or that people would have to go through some of the things that I have had to go through, not being able to do well on tests, because I had no word processor available to me. That type of thing, even though they are all over the place, elsewhere. It was just that that wasn't an acceptable solution. That type of policy planning, that type of government, that type of order scares me. And I have to ask, what is your answer to that?
DAVIES: The apocalyptic vision of a world in grief and individual rights in crisis has nothing to do with a Luddite mentality, and it would be very dangerous for the people in this room to link the two together. I, for one, believe in technology. I am very grateful for it, and I think the world is a better place for it. I have great faith in the future, but technology's not a silver lining for the future. It's not an El Dorado, it's more like plutonium. The very great thing that technology does for all of us can also be used by the people who would repress our freedoms and all I am saying is be aware of that. Let's not marginalize people like me, who are saying, Hey look, we are going to have 15 billion people on the planet. We are going to have a political inversion, you know, that is going to create massive tensions that are going to repress our rights, or at least create a tension that we have never known before. Don't marginalize me -- don't shoot the messenger. I believe in technology, so please don't equate the apocalypse with Ludditism -- the two do not match.
LIASSON: We're about out of time. I'm going to turn this over to Lance.
HOFFMAN: Thank you, Mara. I'm really unhappy that we are out of time, but I feel that we have a contract to those who want to leave in a moment or two. Those who want to stay, can stay up here, are welcome to continue, until the hotel throws us out. Since Lu Kleppinger is in the room at the moment, I don't know when that will be, but we can probably have it for a little while. I just want to make a couple of comments before I formally close this meeting.
We have seen an awful lot happen in these last three days and there has been building, and indeed we will be continuing to some extent the work that Jim Warren started at CFP-1 -- a sense of community. It has been increased by the participation of various diverse groups. My one hope is that you do not stop that here. When each and every one of you goes home, contact -- I don't care whether it's by letter, or electronic mail, or even telephone, if you must -- three people that you have met here that you didn't know, or didn't know very well before, or perhaps only knew electronically, and now you know them in person, and continue talking with them and to their friends and colleagues. If you do that, this will be a success.
The other comment that I want to make is that Bruce Koball is going to need a lot of help for CFP-3. Please talk to him -- he is listed in the roster. Or better yet, don't do that, talk to him here, and then give him a month to chill out in Berkeley before he has to start working real hard. Check the message board, there are some messages that have not been picked up. You have your evaluation forms. If you haven't filled them out and you would like to, please do and turn them in. I have nothing else, except to thank you all for being such a good group and, hopefully, we'll see you next year in California. Thank you very much.
Support efforts at engaging society and government on the appropriate legal and social uses of technology.",['Peter Denning.'],8784,multifieldqa_en,en,,80a04c9306d232e6327b14f03e260d28060fe12395d87e31," Mitch Hoffman introduces the McLaughlin Group panel. Panelists will discuss key issues for today, and for what happens in the next decade and beyond. Panelist Mara Liasson: I am probably the only person here who has absolutely no background in technology. People no longer trust that powerful government can deliver a better life, panelist Peter Denning says.. Business success depends on what happens around the globe, not only on local conditions, panel member Roland Homet says. The panel will take questions from the audience at 4:10 p.m. ET on Thursday. The full panel will be on display at the ACM conference in Washington, D.C., through the end of the month. For more information, go to ACM.com/Mitch and @ACM_Mitch on Twitter and @Mitch_Hoffman on Facebook, or visit ACM's Web site, or go to www.acm.org/mitch and #MitchHoffmann on Twitter.  cryptographic technology produces mechanisms for digital signatures, authentication, electronic money, certificates, and private communication. Government institutions tend to try to hold onto their power by regulatory coercion to enforce the old ways. The old premises have fallen away in the new reality, but the old policy remains. It's time to rethink the policy, before tensions between a threatened government and corporations produce significant social tension and perhaps breakage. The Electronic Freedom Foundation presented its first awards at a related, adjacent reception which was not formally a part of the conference. The awards were presented by Tom Jennings, who spoke so eloquently about this at the Pioneer awards yesterday -- as an outsider, as I was. I've always seen myself, and felt myself to the core of my being, as an outsiders, every bit as much as a self-proclaimed outsider.

""I don't know,"" says Quest, ""if we're going to be able to answer that question."" The first point I'd make is let's not make the unnecessary mistake of betting on a single infrastructure. A lot of the risks that come with private ownership of infrastructure go away when it's no longer a monopoly. The abusive problems that are sometimes experienced with local phone service and cable companies -- both of which are private sector monopolies -- come more from their monopoly character. If it is possible for there to be competition, that serves as the most effective check that we know of in this society against abuse. Government has to make sure that everybody stays interconnected -- it's the referee that keeps the playing field level, doesn't let people cheat, and sort of bangs a few heads together when people get a little greedy, or a little too selfish. If we do that, that will provide for the most choice and the most diversity. (applause) It was decided, because the broadcasters felt threatened, to treat cable as a species of broadcasting.

How does the conduction gap depend on the strain direction?,"\section{Introduction}

In spite of being an attractive material with excellent electronic properties \cite{ahcn09},  practical applications of graphene as in conventional semiconductor devices are still questionable due to its gapless nature. In particular, the ON/OFF current ratio is low while the saturation of current is poor in pristine graphene transistors \cite{schw10}. Many efforts of bandgap engineering in graphene \cite{yhan07,khar11,lher13,jbai10,zhan09} have been made to solve these issues. The pioneer technique proposed \cite{yhan07} is to cut 2D graphene sheets into 1D narrow nanoribons. In 2D graphene sheets, some options as Bernal-stacking of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride substrate \cite{khar11}, nitrogen-doped graphene \cite{lher13}, graphene nanomesh lattice \cite{jbai10,berr13} and Bernal-stacking bilayer graphene \cite{zhan09} have been explored. However, the possibility to open a sizable bandgap in graphene as large as those of standard semiconductors is still very unlikely. In particular, it requires a very good control of lattice geometry and edge disorder in narrow graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) \cite{quer08} and in graphene nanomesh lattices \cite{hung13}, while the bandgap opening in bilayer graphene by a perpendicular electric field may not be large enough for realistic applications \cite{fior09}. Other methods should be further verified by experiments.

\label{fig_sim1}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, graphene was experimentally demonstrated to be able to sustain a much larger strain than conventional semiconductors, making it a promising candidate for flexible electronics (see in a recent review \cite{shar13}). Indeed, strain engineering has been suggested to be an alternative approach to modulating efficiently the electronic properties of graphene nanomaterials. In particular, the bandgap has periodic oscillations in the armchair GNRs \cite{ylu210} while the spin polarization at the ribbon edges (and also the bandgap) can be modulated by the strain in the zigzag cases. In 2D graphene sheets, a finite gap can open under large strains, otherwise, it may remain close to zero but the Dirac points are displaced \cite{cocc10,per209,pere09,huan10}. Many interesting electrical, optical, and magnetic properties induced by strain in graphene have been also explored, e.g. see in \cite{bunc07,pere09,kuma12,per010,pell10,guin10,tlow10,zhai11}.

Besides, local strain is a good option to improve the electrical performance of graphene devices \cite{pere09,ylu010,fuji10,juan11,baha13}. For instance, it has been shown to enhance the ON current in a GNR tunneling FET \cite{ylu010} and to fortify the transport gap in GNR strained junctions \cite{baha13}. In a recent work \cite{hung14}, we have investigated the effects of uniaxial strain on the transport in 2D unstrained/strained graphene junctions and found that due to the strain-induced shift of Dirac points, a significant conduction gap of a few hundreds meV can open with a small strain of a few percent. This type of strained junction was then demonstrated to be an excellent candidate to improve the electronic operation of graphene transistors. It hence motivates us to further investigate the properties of this conduction gap so as to optimize the performance of graphene devices. On the one hand, the effects of strain should be, in principle, dependent on its applied direction. On the other hand, because the appearance of conduction gap is a consequence of the shift of Dirac points along the $k_y$-axis, it is predicted that this gap should also depend on the transport direction. Note that here, Oy (Ox) - axis is assumed to be perpendicular (parallel) to the transport direction. The effects of both strain and transport directions will be clarified systematically in the current work.

\section{Model and calculations}

In this work, the $\pi$-orbital tight binding model constructed in \cite{per209} is used to investigate the electronic transport through the graphene strained junctions schematized in Fig. 1. The Hamiltonian is ${H_{tb}} = \sum\nolimits_{nm} {{t_{nm}}c_n^\dag {c_m}}$ where $t_{nm}$ is the hopping energy between nearest neighbor \emph{n}th and \emph{m}th atoms. The application of a uniaxial strain of angle $\theta$ causes the following changes in the $C-C$ bond vectors:
\begin{eqnarray}
 {{\vec r}_{nm}}\left( \sigma \right) &=& \left\{ {1 + {M_s}\left( \sigma, \theta \right)} \right\}{{\vec r}_{nm}}\left( 0 \right) \\
 {M_s}\left( \sigma, \theta \right) &=& \sigma \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
 {{{\cos }^2}\theta  - \gamma {{\sin }^2}\theta }&{\left( {1 + \gamma } \right)\sin \theta \cos \theta }\\
 {\left( {1 + \gamma } \right)\sin \theta \cos \theta }&{{{\sin }^2}\theta  - \gamma {{\cos }^2}\theta }
 \end{array}} \right] \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\sigma$ represents the strain and $\gamma \simeq 0.165$ is the Poisson ratio \cite{blak70}. The hopping parameters are defined as $t_{nm} \left( \sigma \right) = t_0 \exp\left[-3.37\left(r_{nm} \left( \sigma \right) /r_0 - 1\right)\right]$, where the hopping energy $t_0 = -2.7$ $eV$ and the bond length $r_{nm} \left( 0 \right) \equiv r_0 = 0.142$ $nm$ in the unstrained case. Therefore, there are three different hoping parameters $t_{1,2,3}$ corresponding to three bond vectors ${\vec r}_{1,2,3}$, respectively, in the strained graphene part of the structure (see Fig. 1). Here, we assume a 1D profile of applied strain, i.e., the strain tensor is a function of position along the transport direction Ox while it is constant along the Oy-axis. The transport direction, $\phi$, and strain direction, $\theta$, are determined as schematized in Fig. 1. Based on this tight binding model, two methods described below can be used to investigate the conduction gap of the considered strained junctions.

\textbf{Green's function calculations.} First, we split the graphene sheet into the smallest possible unit cells periodically repeated along the Ox/Oy directions with the indices $p/q$, respectively (similarly, see the details in \cite{hung12}). The tight-binding Hamiltonian can therefore be expressed in the following form:
\begin{eqnarray}
{H_{tb}} = \sum\limits_{p,q} {\left( {{H_{p,q}} + \sum\limits_{{p_1},{q_1}} {{H_{p,q \to p_1,q_1}}} } \right)}
\end{eqnarray}
where $H_{p,q}$ is the Hamiltonian of cell $\{p,q\}$, and $H_{p,q \to p_1,q_1}$ denotes the coupling of cell $\{p,q\}$ to its nearest neighbor cell $\{p_1,q_1\}$. We then Fourier transform the operators in Eq. (2) as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
 {c_{p,q}} = \frac{1}{{\sqrt {{M_{cell}}} }}\sum\limits_{{\kappa_y}} {{e^{i{q\kappa_y}}}} {{\hat c}_{p,{\kappa_y}}},
\end{eqnarray}
where $M_{cell}$ is the number of unit cells and $\kappa_y \equiv k_y L_y$ with the size $L_y$ of unit cells along the Oy direction. The Hamiltonian (2) is finally rewritten as a sum of $\kappa_y$-dependent 1D-components:
\begin{eqnarray}
{H_{tb}} &=& \sum\limits_{{\kappa_y}} {\hat H\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right)} \\
\hat H\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right) &=& \sum\limits_p {{{\hat H}_{p \to p - 1}}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right) + {{\hat H}_p}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right) + {{\hat H}_{p \to p + 1}}}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
With this Hamiltonian form, the Green's function formalism can be easily applied to compute transport quantities in the graphene strained junction with different transport directions. In particular, the conductance at zero temperature is determined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \mathcal{G} \left( \epsilon \right) = \frac{{e^2 W}}{{\pi h L_y}}\int\limits_{BZ} {d{\kappa_y} \mathcal{T}\left( {\epsilon, {\kappa_y}} \right)}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathcal{T}\left( {\epsilon,{\kappa_y}} \right)$ is the transmission probability computed from the Green's functions. The integration over $\kappa_y$ is performed in the whole first Brillouin zone. As in ref. \cite{hung13}, the gap of conductance (conduction gap) is then measured from the obtained data of conductance.

\textbf{Bandstructure analyses.} To determine the conduction gap of strained junctions, we find that another simple way based on the analysis of graphene bandstructures could be efficiently used. It is described as follows. Since the conductance is computed from Eq. (5), the appearance of conduction gap is essentially governed by the gaps of transmission probability, which is determined from the energy gaps in the unstrained and strained graphene sections. These energy gaps can be defined directly from the graphene bandstructures. Therefore, our calculation has two steps, similar to that in \cite{hung14}. From the graphene bandstructures obtained using the tight-binding Hamiltonian above, we first look for the energy gaps $E_{unstrain}^{gap}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right)$ and $E_{strain}^{gap}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right)$ for a given $\kappa_y$ of two graphene sections. The maximum of these energy gaps determines the gap $E_{junc}^{gap}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right)$ of transmission probability through the junction. Finally, the conduction gap $E_{cond.gap}$ is obtained by looking for the minimum value of $E_{junc}^{gap}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right)$ when varying $\kappa_y$ in the whole Brillouin zone.

In particular, the energy bands of strained graphene are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
 E\left( {\vec k} \right) =  \pm \left| {{t_1}{e^{i\vec k{{\vec a}_1}}} + {t_2}{e^{i\vec k{{\vec a}_2}}} + {t_3}} \right|
\end{eqnarray}
where the plus/minus sign corresponds to the conduction/valence bands, respectively. For a given direction $\phi$ of transport, in principle, the vectors $\vec L_{x,y}$ defining the sizes of unit cell along the Ox and Oy directions, respectively, can be always expressed as ${\vec L_x} = {n_1}{\vec a_1} + {n_2}{\vec a_2}$ and ${\vec L_y} = {m_1}{\vec a_1} + {m_2}{\vec a_2}$ with $\cos \phi = \frac{{{{\vec L}_x}\vec L_x^0}}{{{L_x}L_x^0}}$ and $\sin \phi = \frac{{{{\vec L}_x}\vec L_y^0}}{{{L_x}L_y^0}}$ while $\vec L_{x,y}^0 = {\vec a_1} \pm {\vec a_2}$. Note that $n_{1,2}$ and $m_{1,2}$ are integers while $\frac{{{m_1}}}{{{m_2}}} =  - \frac{{{n_1} + 2{n_2}}}{{{n_2} + 2{n_1}}}$, i.e., ${\vec L_{x}} {\vec L_{y}} = 0$. In other words, we have the following expressions
\begin{eqnarray}
{{{\vec a}_1} = \frac{{ - {m_2}{{\vec L}_x} + {n_2}{{\vec L}_y}}}{{{n_2}{m_1} - {n_1}{m_2}}};\,\,\,{{\vec a}_2} = \frac{{{m_1}{{\vec L}_x} - {n_1}{{\vec L}_y}}}{{{n_2}{m_1} - {n_1}{m_2}}}}
\end{eqnarray}
On this basis, the energy bands can be rewritten in terms of $\kappa_{x, y} = \vec k \vec L_{x,y} \left( { \equiv {k_{x,y}}{L_{x,y}}} \right)$ by substituting Eqs. (7) into Eq. (6). This new form of energy bands is finally used to compute the conduction gap of strained junctions.

As a simple example, in the case of $\phi = 0$ (armchair direction), we calculate the conduction gap as follows. First, Eq. (6) is rewritten in the form
\begin{eqnarray}
 E_{\phi = 0}\left( {\vec \kappa} \right) =  \pm \left| {{t_1}{e^{i\kappa_y/2}} + {t_2}{e^{ - i\kappa_y/2}} + {t_3}{e^{ - i\kappa_x/2}}} \right|
\end{eqnarray}
with the vectors $\vec L_{x,y} \equiv \vec L_{x,y}^0$. Using this new form, the energy gap of strained graphene for a given $\kappa_y$ is determined as
\begin{equation}
{E_{strain}^{gap}}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right) = 2 \left| {\sqrt {{{\left( {{t_1} - {t_2}} \right)}^2} + 4{t_1}{t_2}{{\cos }^2}\frac{{{\kappa_y}}}{2}}  + {t_3}} \right|
\end{equation}
while ${E_{unstrain}^{gap}}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right)$ is given by the same formula with $t_1$ = $t_2$ = $t_3$ $\equiv$ $t_0$. The gap of transmission probability through the junction is then determined as ${E_{junc}^{gap}}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right) = \max \left[ {E_{unstrain}^{gap}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right),E_{strain}^{gap}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right)} \right]$ and, finally, the conduction gap is given by ${E_{cond.gap}} = \min \left[ {E_{junc}^{gap}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right)} \right]$ for $\kappa_y$ in the whole Brillouin zone.

We would like to notice that the Green's function calculations and the banstructure analyses give the same results of conduction gap in the junctions where the transition region between unstrained and strained graphene sections is long enough, i.e., larger than about 5 to 6 nm. In the case of short length, as discussed in \cite{baha13,hung14}, this transition zone can have significant effects on the transmission between propagating states beyond the energy gaps and hence can slightly enlarge the gap of conductance, compared to the results obtained from the bandstructure calculations.

\label{fig_sim4}
\end{figure*}
First, we re-examine the formation of the bandgap of graphene under a uniaxial strain. From Eq. (9), it is shown that a strain-induced finite-bandgap appears only if ${E_{strain}^{gap}}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right) > 0$ for all $k_y$ in the first Brillouin zone, i.e., ${k _y} \in \left[ { - \frac{\pi}{L_y}, \frac{\pi}{L_y}} \right]$, otherwise, the bandgap remains zero. Hence, the condition for the bandgap to be finite is either
\begin{equation*}
 \left| {{t_1} - {t_2}} \right| > \left| {{t_3}} \right|\,\,\,\,\,{\rm{OR}}\,\,\,\,\,\left| {{t_3}} \right| > \left| {{t_1} + {t_2}} \right|
\end{equation*}
and the corresponding values of bandgap are
\begin{equation*}
 {E_{gap}} = 2\left( {\left| {{t_1} - {t_2}} \right| - \left| {{t_3}} \right|} \right)\,\,\,\,\,{\rm{OR}}\,\,\,\,\,2\left( {\left| {{t_3}} \right| - \left| {{t_1} + {t_2}} \right|} \right)
\end{equation*}
This result was actually reported in \cite{per209,hase06}. We remind as displayed in Fig. 2(a) that a finite bandgap opens only for strain larger than $\sim 23 \%$ and the zigzag (not armchair) is the preferred direction for bandgap opening under a tensile strain \cite{per209}. We extend our investigation to the case of compressive strain and find  (see in Fig. 2(b)) that (i) the same gap threshold of $\sigma \simeq 23 \%$ is observed but (ii) the preferred direction to open the gap under a compressive strain is the armchair, not the zigzag as the case of tensile strain. This implies that the properties of graphene bandstructure at low energy should be qualitatively the same when applying strains of $\left\{ {\sigma ,\theta } \right\}$ and of $\left\{ {-\sigma ,\theta + 90^\circ} \right\}$. This feature can be understood by considering, for example, strains of $\left\{ {\sigma , \theta = 0} \right\}$ and of $\left\{ {-\sigma , \theta = 90^\circ} \right\}$. Indeed, these strains result in the same qualitative changes on the bond-lengths, i.e., an increased bond-length $r_3$ and reduced bond-lengths $r_{1,2}$. However, for the same strain strength, because of the exponential dependence of hoping energies on the bond-lengths, the compressive strain generally induces a larger bandgap than the tensile one, as can be seen when comparing the data displayed in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). To conclude, we would like to emphasize that a large strain is necessary to open a bandgap in graphene. This could be an issue for practical applications, compared to the use of graphene strained junctions explored in \cite{hung14}.

We now go to explore the properties of conduction gap in the graphene strained junctions. In Fig. 3, we display the conductance as a function of energy computed from Eq. (5) using the Green's function technique. As discussed above, a small strain of a few percent (e.g., 4 $\%$ here) can not change the gapless character of graphene, i.e., there is no gap of conductance in the case of uniformly strained graphene. However, similar to that reported in \cite{hung14}, a significant conduction-gap of a few hundreds meV can open in the unstrained/strained graphene junctions. The appearance of this conduction gap, as mentioned previously, is due to the strain-induced shift of Dirac points and is explained as follows. Actually, the strain causes the lattice deformation and can result in the deformation of graphene bandstructure. Therefore, the bandedges as a function of wave-vector $k_y$ in unstrained and strained graphene can be illustrated schematically as in the top panel of Fig. 4. As one can see, the shift of Dirac points leads to the situation where there is no value of $\kappa_y$, for which the energy gaps $E_{unstrain}^{gap}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right)$ and $E_{strain}^{gap}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right)$ are simultaneously equal to zero. This means that the transmission probability always shows a finite gap for any $\kappa_y$. For instance, the energy gap is zero (or small) in the unstrained (resp. strained) graphene section but finite in the strained (resp. unstrained) one in the vicinity of Dirac point $k_y = K_{unstrain}$ (resp. $K_{strain}$). Accordingly, as illustrated in the pictures of LDOS in the left panels of Fig. 4 and confirmed in the corresponding transmissions in the right panels, clear gaps of transmission are still obtained. Far from these values of $k_y$, $E_{unstrain}^{gap}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right)$ and $E_{strain}^{gap}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right)$ are both finite (e.g., see the LDOS plotted for $k_y = K_{gap}$) and hence a finite gap of transmission also occurs. On this basis, a finite gap of conductance is achieved. More important, Fig. 3 shows that besides the strength of strain, the strain effect is also strongly dependent on the applied direction. For instance, the conduction gap takes the values of $\sim$ 295, 172 and 323 meV for $\theta = 0$, $30^\circ$ and $90^\circ$, respectively.

Below, we will discuss the properties of the conduction gap with respect to the strain, its applied direction, and the direction of transport. Note that due to the lattice symmetry, the transport directions $\phi$ and $\phi + 60^\circ$ are equivalent while the applied strain of angle $\theta$ is identical to that of $\theta + 180^\circ$. Hence, the data obtained for $\phi$ ranging from $-30^\circ$ to $30^\circ$ and $\theta  \in \left[ {0^\circ ,180^\circ } \right]$ covers the properties of conduction gap in all possible cases.

In Fig. 5, we present the maps of conduction gap with respect to the strain and its applied direction in two particular cases: the transport is either along the armchair ($\phi = 0$) or the zigzag ($\phi = 30^\circ$) directions. Both tensile and compressive strains are considered. Let us first discuss the results obtained in the armchair case. Figs. 5(a,b) show that (i) a large conduction gap up to about 500 meV can open with a strain of 6 $\%$ and (ii) again the conduction gap is strongly $\theta$-dependent, in particular, its peaks occur at $\theta = 0$ or $90^\circ$ while the gap is zero at $\theta \approx 47^\circ$ and $133^\circ$ for tensile strain and at $\theta \approx 43^\circ$ and $137^\circ$ for compressive strain. In principle, the conduction gap is larger if the shift of Dirac points in the $\kappa_y$-axis is larger, as discussed above about Figs. 3-4. We notice that the strain-induced shifts can be different for the six Dirac points of graphene \cite{kitt12} and the gap is zero when there is any Dirac point observed at the same $\kappa_y$ in the two graphene sections. From Eq. (9), we find that the Dirac points are determined by the following equations:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  {\cos}\frac{\kappa_y}{2} &=& \pm \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{{t_3^2 - {{\left( {{t_1} - {t_2}} \right)}^2}}}{{{t_1}{t_2}}}}, \\
  \cos \frac{{\kappa_x}}{2} &=& \frac{{{t_1} + {t_2}}}{{\left| {{t_3}} \right|}}\cos \frac{{\kappa_y}}{2},\,\,\,\sin \frac{{\kappa_x}}{2} = \frac{{{t_2} - {t_1}}}{{\left| {{t_3}} \right|}}\sin \frac{{\kappa_y}}{2},
\end{eqnarray*}
which simplify into ${\cos}\frac{\kappa_y}{2} = \pm \frac{1}{2}$ and, respectively, $\cos \left( {\frac{{{\kappa _x}}}{2}} \right) = \mp 1$ in the unstrained case. Hence, the zero conduction gap is obtained if
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{{t_3^2 - {{\left( {{t_1} - {t_2}} \right)}^2}}}{{4{t_1}{t_2}}} = \frac{1}{4}
\end{equation*}
Additionally, it is observed that the effects of a strain $\{\sigma,\theta\}$ are qualitatively similar to those of a strain $\{-\sigma,\theta+90^\circ\}$, i.e., the peaks and zero values of conduction gap are obtained at the same $\theta$ in these two situations. To understand this, we analyze the strain matrix $M_s \left(\sigma,\theta\right)$ and find that in the case of small strains studied here, there is an approximate relationship between the bond lengths under these two strains, given by \[{r \left( \sigma, \theta \right)} - {r \left( -\sigma, \theta + 90^\circ\right)} \simeq \sigma \left( {1 - \gamma } \right) r_0,\] which is $\theta$-independent for all \emph{C-C} bond vectors. It implies that there is a fixed ratio between the hopping energies $t_i \left( \sigma, \theta \right)$ and $t_i \left( -\sigma, \theta + 90^\circ\right)$ and hence there is the similar shift of Dirac points in these two cases.

\label{fig_sim4}
\end{figure*}

We now go to analyze the properties of conduction gap shown in Figs. 5(c,d) where the transport is along the zigzag direction $\phi = 30^\circ$. In fact, the conduction gap in this case can reach a value as high as that of the case of $\phi = 0$ but has different $\theta$-dependence. In particular, the conduction gap has peaks at $\theta \approx 47^\circ$ and $133^\circ$ for tensile strain and at $\theta \approx 43^\circ$ and $137^\circ$ for compressive strain, where it is zero in the case of $\phi = 0$. It is also equal to zero at $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = 90^\circ$ where the peaks of conduction gap occur in the latter case of $\phi = 0$. The relationship between these two transport directions can be explained as follows. On the one hand, based on the analyses above for $\phi = 0$, we find that for a given strength of strain, a maximum shift of Dirac points along the $k_y$-axis corresponds to a minimum along the $k_x$-one and vice versa when varying the strain direction $\theta$. On the other hand, as schematized in the top of Fig. 6 below, the change in the transport direction results in the rotation of the first Brillouin zone, i.e., the $k_x$ (resp. $k_y$) axis in the case of $\phi = 30^\circ$ is identical to the $k_y$ (resp. $k_x$) axis in the case of $\phi = 0$. These two features explain essentially the opposite $\theta$-dependence of conduction gap for $\phi = 30^\circ$, compared to the case of $\phi = 0$ as mentioned. Again, we found the same qualitative behavior of conduction gap when applying the strains of $\{\sigma,\theta\}$ and $\{-\sigma,\theta+90^\circ\}$.

Next, we investigate the conduction gap with respect to different transport directions $\phi$. We display a ($\theta,\phi$)-map of conduction gap for $\sigma = 4 \%$ in Fig. 6 and, in the top, an additional diagram illustrating the rotation of Dirac points in the $k-$space with the change in the transport direction. It is clearly shown that (i) a similar scale of conduction gap is obtained for all different transport directions, (ii) there is a smooth and continuous shift of $E_{cond.gap}-\theta$ behavior when varying $\phi$, and (iii) the same behavior of $E_{cond.gap}$ is also observed when comparing the two transport directions of $\phi$ and $\phi+30^\circ$, similarly to the comparison above between $\phi = 0^\circ$ and $30^\circ$. The data plotted in Fig. 6 additionally shows that $E_{cond.gap}$ takes the same value in both cases of $\{\phi,\theta\}$ and $\{-\phi,-\theta\}$ with a remark that the strains of $-\theta$ and $180^\circ-\theta$ are identical. Moreover, the values of $\theta$ and $\phi$, for which the conduction gap has a peak or is equal to zero, have an almost linear relationship. In particular, the relationship for conduction gap peaks is approximately given by $\theta = \theta_A - \eta_s \phi$. For tensile strains, $\eta_s$ takes the values of $\sim 1.5667$ and $1.4333$ for $\theta_A = 0$ and $90^\circ$, respectively. On the opposite, it is about $1.4333$ and $1.5667$ for $\theta_A = 0$ and $90^\circ$, respectively, for compressive strain cases. All these features are consequences of the rotation of Dirac points in the $k$-space with respect to the transport direction $\phi$ as illustrated in the diagram on the top and the lattice symmetry of graphene.

Finally, we investigate other junctions based on compressive and tensile strained graphene sections. The idea is that in this type of strained junction, the shifts of Dirac points are different in two graphene sections of different strains, which offers the possibilities to use smaller strains to achieve a similar conduction gap, compared to the case of unstrained/strained junction. In Fig. 7, we display the maps of conduction gap with respect to the directions of compressive ($\theta_c$) and tensile ($\theta_t$) strains in two cases of transport direction $\phi = 0$ (armchair) and $30^\circ$ (zigzag) for given strain strengths. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 7(a,b), with smaller strains $\left\{ {{\sigma _c},{\sigma _t}} \right\} = \left\{ { - 2\% ,2\% } \right\}$ or $\left\{ { - 1\% ,3\% } \right\}$, similar conduction gap of about 310 meV can be achieved (see Figs. 7(a,b)) while it requires a strain of 4 $\%$ in the unstrained/strained junctions discussed above. However, since the shift of Dirac points is strongly dependent on the direction of applied strains and the transport direction, the properties of conduction gap are more complicated than in the latter case. In particular, our calculations show that the preferred transport directions to achieve a large conduction gap are close to the armchair one. Otherwise, the conduction gap is generally smaller, similarly to the data for $\phi = 30^\circ$ compared to $\phi = 0$, as shown in Fig. 7. Additionally, it is shown that the preferred directions of applied strains in the case of $\phi = 0$ are close to ${\theta _c} \equiv {\theta _t} = 0$ or $90^\circ$.

\section{Conclusion}

Based on the tight binding calculations, we have investigated the effects of uniaxial strain on the transport properties of graphene strained junctions and discuss systematically the possibilities of achieving a large conduction gap with respect to the strain, its applied direction and the transport direction. It has been shown that due to the strain-induced deformation of graphene lattice and hence of graphene bandstructure, a finite conduction gap higher than 500 meV can be achieved for a strain of only 6 $\%$. Moreover, as a consequence of the shift of Dirac points along the $k_y$-axis, the conduction gap is strongly dependent not only on the strain strength but also on the direction of applied strain and the transport direction. A full picture of these properties of conduction gap has been presented and explained. The study hence could be a good guide for the use of this type of unstrained/strained graphene junction in electronic applications.

","['Peaks occur at certain strain directions, while the gap is zero at others.']",4334,multifieldqa_en,en,,69ea47e54e2cedec193247f452f5d3bbef2566a93f1dd353," Graphene is an attractive material with excellent electronic properties. However, practical applications of graphene as in conventional semiconductor devices are still questionable due to its gapless nature. The possibility to open a sizable bandgap in graphene as large as those of standard semiconductors is still very unlikely. Local strain is a good option to improve the electrical performance of graphene devices. It has been shown to enhance the ON current in a GNR tunneling FET and to fortify the transport gap in GNR strained junctions. The effects of both strain and transport directions will be systematically clarified systematically in the future to improve graphene's electronic performance. The results of this work will be published in the Journal of Strain Engineering and Nanomaterials (JSTN) (http://www.jstn.org/news/article.php?storylink=cpy&storylink =cpy & storylink=cs&page=1&page_title&page-content=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,28,.28,33,.29,34,34,.34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,44,44,.36,41,.41,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,58,.59,59,.60,61,62 In this work, the $\pi$-orbital tight binding model is used to investigate the electronic transport through the graphene strained junctions schematized in Fig. 1. We split the graphene sheet into the smallest possible unit cells periodically repeated along the Ox/Oy directions with the indices $p/q$ respectively. The Hamiltonian is expressed in the following form:. The strain tensor is a function of position along the transport direction Ox while it is constant along the Oy-axis. We then transform the operators in Eq. (2) as follows:. Fourier transform of the number of cells with the operators. $p,q$ is the Hamiltonian of cell. $P,q_1$ denotes the coupling of cell $H,q to its nearest neighbor, $p_1_1q_0$ to its neighbor, and. $Q,q is the coupling between cell $Q and its neighbor. The transport direction, $phi, and strain direction, $\theta$ are determined as schematization in Fig., 1. Based on this tight bindingmodel, two methods described below can be used to investigation the conduction gap of the considered stretched junctions. The methods are described in the next section. The appearance of conduction gap is essentially governed by the gaps of transmission probability, which is determined from the energy gaps in the unstrained and strained graphene sections. These energy gaps can be defined directly from the graphene bandstructures. This new form of energy bands is finally used to compute the conduction gaps of strained junctions. As in ref. (5), the gap of conductance (conduction gap) is then measured from the obtained data ofconductance. The maximum of these energy gaps determines the gap $E_{junc}^{gap}\left( {{\kappa_y}} \right)$ of transmission probabilities through the junction. In other words, the energy bands of strained graphene are given by. Eq. (7) (Eqs. (6) and (7), respectively) The energy bands can be rewritten in terms of the direction of transport, in principle, the sizes of unit cell along the Ox and Oy directions, respectively, can be always expressed as. $n_1$ and $m_1,2$ are integers while the plus/minus sign corresponds to the. conduction/valence bands, respectively. For a simple example, in the. chair case of 0armchair (chair = 0), we use the following expressions: $L_x = 0, L_y = 0,. L_x^0 = 0. We would like to notice that the Green's function calculations and the banstructure analyses give the same results of conduction gap in the junctions where the transition region between unstrained and strained graphene sections is long enough. In the case of short length, this transition zone can have significant effects on the transmission between propagating states beyond the energy gaps and hence can slightly enlarge the gap of conductance, compared to the results obtained from the bandstructure calculations. We re-examine the formation of the bandgap of graphene under a uniaxial strain. From Eq. (9), it is shown that a strain-induced finite-bandgap appears only if $G_0 = e^2W/hL_y$ for all $k_y $ in the first Brillouin zone, i.e., $K_y = 0$ in all cases. The condition for a bandgap to be finite is either the condition for the band gap to be either zero or for it to be a finite number of times larger than 0. We conclude by showing that a band gap of 0.0 is a finite value for $K-0.0$ in the whole Brillouins zone, and that it can only be found if the gap is at least 0. A large strain is necessary to open a bandgap in graphene. This could be an issue for practical applications, compared to the use of graphene strained junctions explored inhung14. In Fig. 3, we display the conductance as a function of energy computed from Eq. (5) using the Green's function technique. For instance, the energy gap is zero (or small) in the unstrained (resp. strained) graphene section but finite in the strained one. We will discuss the properties of the conduction gap with respect to the strain, its applied direction, and the direction of transport due to strain due to the symmetry of the lattice. Note that the lattices, lattice symmetry and transport directions are equivalent while the applied strain of $\theta$ is identical to that of the strain of $k_y$ in all possible cases of all possible conduction in all lattice directions, ranging from $30 to $180 + 60^\circ + 180 + 60% in all cases. We conclude that besides the strength of strain, the strain effect is also strongly dependent on the applied direction.Below, we discuss the Conduction Gap Properties of Graphene in strained/unstrained junctions. We also show how to use this information in the development of graphene-based nanomaterials. ther along the armchair ($\phi = 0$) or the zigzag ($ \phi = 30^\circ$) directions.

We notice that the strain-induced shifts can be different for the six Dirac. points of graphene and the gap is zero when there is any Dirac point observed at the same. point in the two graphene sections. It is observed that the effects of a strain $M_s, $theta$ are qualitatively similar to those of a. strain $Sigma,$theta. We analyze the strain matrix and find that in the case of small strains there is an approximate relationship between the bond lengths under these two strains, given by the ratio of bond lengths. It implies that there is a fixed ratio between the hopping energies between the. the bond vectors for hopping energies $t_i, $t-i, \theta, and $c-C-C. There is a similar ratio between hopping energies for hopping. energies between hopping. the. bond vectors $t.i, $t-c, ‘c’, ‘c,’’ and ‘’C’ which is $t’ r_0,\theta-independent.

The relationship between these two transport directions can be explained as follows. The change in the transport direction results in the rotation of the first Brillouin zone, i.e., the $K_x$ axis in the case of $30^\circ$ is identical to the $ k_x' axis in $0$.

abstract

Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with high dimensionality are commonly encountered in computational physics and engineering. However, finding solutions for these PDEs can be computationally expensive, making model-order reduction crucial. We propose such a data-driven scheme that automates the identification of the time-scales involved and, can produce stable predictions forward in time as well as under different initial conditions not included in the training data.
To this end, we combine a non-linear autoencoder architecture with a time-continuous model for the latent dynamics in the complex space. It readily allows for the inclusion of sparse and irregularly sampled training data. The learned, latent dynamics are interpretable and reveal the different temporal scales involved.
We show that this data-driven scheme can automatically learn the independent processes that decompose a system of linear ODEs along the eigenvectors of the system's matrix. Apart from this, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in a hidden Markov Model and the (discretized) Kuramoto-Shivashinsky (KS) equation.
Additionally, we propose a probabilistic version, which captures predictive uncertainties and further improves upon the results of the deterministic framework.

INTRODUCTION

High-fidelity simulations of critical phenomena such as ocean dynamics and epidemics have become essential for decision-making. They are based on physically-motivated PDEs expressing system dynamics that span multiple spatiotemporal scales and which necessitate cumbersome computations . In recent years there is increased attention to the development of data-driven models that can accelerate the solution of these PDEs as well as reveal salient, lower-dimensional features that control the long-term evolution.
In most cases, data-driven reduced-order models are not interpretable. In particular, models based on neural networks despite good predictive capabilities , they offer a black-box description of the system dynamics. A possible remedy is applying a symbolic regression to the learned neural network representation , but this adds additional computational cost due to the two-step procedure.
A number of frameworks such as SINDy allows to learn interpretable dynamics but it relies on the a-priori availability of lower-dimensional descriptors and of time-derivatives which can be very noisy for both simulation and experimental data. Other frameworks are tailored to specific problems such as molecular dynamics .
Here, we present a framework that only needs the value of the observables, and not their derivatives, as training data and is capable of identifying interpretable latent dynamics. The deployment of interpretable latent dynamics ensures that conservation of important properties of that are reflected in the reduced-order model .
The present method is related to approaches based on the Koopman-operator extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) but uses continuous complex-valued latent space dynamics and only requires one scalar variable per latent dimension to describe the latent space dynamics. Therefore we do not have to enforce any parametrizations on the Koopman matrix .
The time-continuous formulation moreover allows to incorporate sparse and irregularly sampled training data and fast generation of predictions after the training phase. By using a complex-valued latent space we can also incorporate harmonic effects and reduce the number of latent variables needed. Linear and non-linear autoencoders are used to map the observed, high-dimensional time-series to the lower-dimensional, latent representation and we identify simultaneously the autoencoder as well as the latent dynamics by optimizing a combined loss function.
Hence the to tasks of dimensionality reduction and discovery of the reduced dynamics are unified while other frameworks treat the two parts separately . Apart from using an architecture based on autoencoders to identify the latent space, projection-based methods could also be employed . We are also proposing a probabilistic version of our algorithm ) that makes use of probabilistic Slow Feature Analysis .
This allows for a latent representation that arart from being time-continuous, can quantify the predictive uncertainty and hierarchically decompose the dynamics into their pertinent scales while promoting the discovery of slow processes that control the system's evolution over long time horizons. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: We introduce the methodological framework as well as algorithmic details in section II.
Particular focus is paid on the interpretability of the inferred lower-dimensional dynamics. In section III we present three numerical illustrations, i.e. a system of linear ODEs, a hidden Markov Model and the discretized KS-equation. We then present in section IV the probabilistic extension of the framework and apply it to the KS-equation.
We conclude with a summary and a short discussion about possible next steps. We introduce the autoencoders deployed in this work, followed by the interpretable latent space dynamic and discuss the training process. We consider data from high-dimensional time series x n ∈ R f with n = 1, ..., T . We remark that the intervals between the different states do not need to be uniformly spaced.

Autoencoder

A core assumption of the method is that each high-dimensional state x n can be compressed to a lower-dimensional representation z n ∈ C c with c << f . We identify this lower-dimensional representation by an autoencoder consisiting of a parameterized encoder and decoder. The encoder maps the high-dimensional representation to the latent space as:
The latent space is complex-valued. The decoder reconstructs the high-dimensional representation based on the latent variables as: We denote the parameters of the encoder as well as the decoder by θ. As discussed later in Section II C, both set of parameters are optimized simultaneously during training and therefore there is no need for differentiating them.

Interpretable Latent Space Dynamics

We employ a propagator in the latent space to capture the reduced-order dynamics of the system. In contrast to other time-extended variational autoencoder frameworks, our representation uses complex valued latent variables. In addition the latent variables are treated independently. The latter feature enables us to have an interpretable latent dynamics as well as a model that is especially suitable for being trained in the Small Data regime due to the small number of required parameters.
This is in contrast to temporal propagators such as LSTMs . For each dimension i of the latent variable z we are using the following continuous ODE in the complex plane: By solving this ODE, we can define the operator: Interpretable reduced-order modeling with time-scale separation Here, λ is a vector containing all the individual λ's and ∆t n indicates the time-step between the latent states.
The symbol is used to indicate a component-wise multiplication. We remark that the latent variables and the parameter governing the temporal evolution are complex numbers and their role in describing the system dynamics is similar to that of an eigenvalue. The real part is associated with growth and decay whereas the imaginary part is representing the periodic component.
This approach has similarities with the Koopman-operator based methods and the extended dynamic mode decomposition . In contrast to the methods mentioned before we are using a continuous formulation in the latent space that allows us to incorporate scarce and irregularly sampled training data and directly rely on complex numbers in the latent space.

Training and Predictions

We optimize a loss function that combines both a reconstruction loss as well as a loss associated with the error of our learned propagator in the latent space: (5) We note that we could directly incorporate mini-batch training by only taking the summation over a subset of the N available training data.
For new predictions of unseen states, we use the encoder to generate a latent representations which is then advanced in time by the learned propagator. At a designated time step we are using the decoder to reconstruct the high-dimensional solution. We applied our algorithm to three systems. First, we show that the algorithm is capable of exactly reproducing the solution of a linear ODE and to identify its eigenvalues.
Afterwards we are applying the framework to a high-dimensional process generated by a complex latent dynamics, which is correctly identified. As a final test case, we are applying the algorithm to a Kuramoto Shivashinski (KS) equation. Interpretable reduced-order modeling with time-scale separation

Linear ODE

We are considering a two-dimensional ODE system for x = y 1 y 2 : Based on the obtained training data we run our algorithm using a linear encoder and decoder structure as well as two latent variables z. The loss function was optimized using the Adam algorithm . As we consider a linear ODE we can analytically compute the eigenvalues involved and compare it with the parameters λ identified by our algorithm.
We observe in Figure that the algorithm was able to recover the correct values, i.e. the eigenvalues 7 and 3 of the given linear ODE. The system does not have a periodic component and the two imaginary parts correctly go to zero, whereas the real parts converge to the reference value. Moreover we are also able to identify for the linear mapping between our latent variables z and the training data a matrix consisting of a multiple of the eigenvectors (1,1) and (1,-1) and thus the correct solution.
This example was chosen to show that the algorithm is able to quickly identify the exact solution of a linear ODE in terms of its linearly independent components.

Hidden multiscale dynamics

We consider eight-dimensional synthetic time series data produced by an underlying twodimensional complex valued process. In particular, the data points x are generated by first solving for the temporal evolution for the two complex-valued processes p 1 and p 2 and than mapping to the eight-dimensional space by using a randomly sampled linear mapping W .
One of the two processes used to generate the data is chosen to be much slower than the other one and both processes have a periodic component. dp 2 dt = (−0.9 + 1.5i)p 2 (8) As training data we consider 40 time series with 150 data points each, obtained by simulating the described processes for a maximum of t = 15 s and then sampling from the obtained data points.
Hence the training data consists of: • 40 time-series • with each consisting 150 observations of the x at a uniform time-step ∆t = 0.0025 The autoencoder obtained consists of one linear layer for both the decoder as well as the encoder. The model is trained for 5000 iterations using the Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 10 −3 .
The results for the convergence of the parameters λ 1 and λ 2 can be found in Figure . We note that the process which is slower decaying and thus more responsible for the long-term evolution of the system has a higher convergence rate than the faster process. With the obtained parameters λ as well as the trained autoencoder, we compute predictions based on the last time step used for training, i.e. we apply the encoder to obtain our latent representation and than use the latent dynamics to advance the latent representation in time.
Afterwards, we employ the decoder to reconstruct the full high-dimensional system. The results can be found in Figure and show very good agreement between predictions and reference data. This example shows that our model is successfully able to carry out dimensionality reduction and moreover indicates that the convergence rate between latent processes can be different.
The latter is relevant when training models as for accurate predictions all latent processes and their dynamics should be converged.

Kuramoto-Sivashinsky

Finally, we applied our algorithm to the KS equation and aim to identify a reduced-order model for the solution u(y, t): We employed periodic boundary conditions, µ = 1 and a domain size y ∈ [0, 22]. For this domain-size, the KS-equation exhibits a structurally stable chaotic attractor as discussed in The black lines divides the area for which training data was given from the area without raining data.
; . The equation is discretized in space using a discretization step of 22 64 resulting in a state vector x of dimension 64 and a nonlinear system of coupled ODEs. This is solved using a stiff fourth-order solver  We employed a non-linear encoder and decoder with four fully-connected layers each and ReLU-activation functions as well as Dropout Layers between the fully-connected layers.
We trained the model for 200000 iterations using Adam and a learning rate of 5 • 10 4 and assuming a five-dimensional latent space. We obtained the λ's in Figure . Four latent variables have λ's close to zero and thus a slow temporal dynamic that is responsible for the long-term evolution whereas one latent variable is quickly decaying.
Based on the obtained parameters, we do predictions based on an unseen initial condition not contained in the training data. We are able to reconstruct the correct phase space based on our predictions despite only using a very limited amount of training data. The results for the phase space can be seen in Figure .
Although the small-scale fluctuations in the temporal dynamics are not well captured, the model identifies the correct manifold which has a good accuracy compared to the reference solution. All phase-spaces were obtained by using a finite-difference operator on the data or predictions. These results are in accordance Interpretable reduced-order modeling with time-scale separation with whose LSTM-based temporal dynamic model was also able to find the correct phase space but not to track the actual dynamics for long-term predictions.
Our model is not able to account for noise in the temporal evolution and thus dealing with chaotic, small-scale fluctuations is challenging. We believe that a probabilistic version of our algorithm could be advantageous here. This section contains a fully probabilistic formulation for the deterministic model discussed before.
We replace the Autoencoder with a Variational Autoencoder and the ODE in the latent space with a SDE. The loss function which we optimize is the Evidence-Lower Bound (ELBO).

Model Structure

We postulate the following relations for our probabilistic model using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) for each dimension i of the latent space and a Wiener process W t in the latent space: We again assume that the latent variables z t are complex-valued and a priori independent. Complex variables were chosen as their evolution includes a harmonic components which are observed in many physical systems.
We assume an initial conditions z 0,i ∼ CN (0, σ 2 0,i ). The total parameters associated with the latent space dynamics of our model are thus {σ 2 0,i , σ 2 i , λ i } c i=1 and will be denoted by θ together with all parameters responsible for the decoder mapping G (see next section). These parameters along with the state variables z t have to be inferred from the data x t .
Based on probabilistic Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) , we set σ 2 i = 2; (λ j ) and σ 2 0,i = 1. As a consequence, a priori, the latent dynamics are stationary. A derivation and reasoning for this choice can be found in Appendix A. Hence the only independent parameters are the λ i , the imaginary part of which can account for periodic effects in the latent dynamics.

Variational Autoencoder

We employ a variational autoencoder to account for a probabilistic mappings from the lower-dimensional representation z n to the high-dimensional system x n . In particular we are employing a probabilistic decoder The encoder is used to infer the state variables z based on the given data and thus defined in the inference and learning section.

Inference and Learning

Given the probabilistic relations , our goal is to infer the latent variables z 0:T as well as all model parameters θ. We follow a hybrid Bayesian approach in which the posterior of the state variables is approximated using amortized Variational Inference and Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) point-estimates for θ are computed.
The application of Bayes' rule for each data sequence x 0:T leads to the following posterior: where p(θ) denotes the prior on the model parameters. In the context of variational inference, we use the following factorization of the approximate posterior i.e. we infer only the mean µ and variance σ for each state variable based on the given data points.
This conditional density used for inference is the encoder-counterpart to the probabilistic decoder defined in the section before. It can be readily shown that the optimal parameter values are found by maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) F(q φ (z 0:T ), θ) which is derived in Appendix B. We compute Monte Carlo estimates of the gradient of the ELBO with respect to φ and θ with the help of the reparametrization trick and carry out stochastic optimization with the ADAM algorithm .

Results for the probabilistic extension

We applied our probabilistic version to the KS-equation. We used the same settings as for the deterministic approach but considered up to 10 complex latent variables. The obtained λ's are in Figure . The probabilistic model allows us to quantify the uncertainty in predictions. In Figure predictions for various time-steps and the respective uncertainty bounds are shown for an unseen initial condition.
Due to the chaotic nature of the KS-equation and the small amount of training data, the underlying linear dynamic of our model is only able to capture the full dynamics for a limited time horizon. Fortunately, due to the probabilistic approach the model is capable of capturing chaotic fluctuations with increasingly wide uncertainty bounds.
We also computed the phase space representation for the KS-equation based on the predictions obtained by our model and compare it with the reference solution. The probabilistic model identifies the correct manifold with a better accuracy than the deterministic model. As some of the small-scale fluctuations are accounted as noise, the resulting manifold is more concentrated at the origin and the obtained values are slightly smaller than the reference manifold although their shape is very similar.",['The paper was published on 7 March 2023.'],3080,multifieldqa_en,en,,46b15f1200c46251053ec3dfa806dbdf515eb34053a5e0d1," Paper: Interpretable reduced-order modeling with time-scale separation. Authors: Data-driven scheme automates the identification of the time-scales involved and can produce stable predictions forward in time as well as under different initial conditions not included in the training data. The deployment of interpretable latent dynamics ensures that conservation of important properties of that are reflected in the reduced- order model. The method is related to approaches based on the Koopman- operator extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) but uses continuous complex-valued latent space dynamics and only requires one scalar. It readily allows for the inclusion of sparse and irregularly sampled training data and reveals the different temporal scales involved. It can also be used in a hidden Markov Model and the (discretized) Kuramoto-Shivashinsky (KS) equation. It is based on a non-linear autoencoder architecture with a time-continuous model for the latent dynamics in the complex space. The proposed framework can automatically learn the independent processes that decompose a system of linear ODEs along the eigenvectors of the system's matrix. The time-continuous formulation allows to incorporate sparse and irregularly sampled training data and fast generation of predictions after the training phase. By using a complex-valued latent space we can also incorporate harmonic effects and reduce the number of latent variables needed. Linear and non-linear autoencoders are used to map the observed, high-dimensional time-series to the lower-dimensional, latent representation. We identify simultaneously the autoencoder as well as the latent dynamics by optimizing a combined loss function. We then present in section IV the probabilistic extension of the framework and apply it to the KS-equation.

We conclude with a summary and a short discussion about possible next steps. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from.. The original version of this article stated that the method was based on the Koopman matrix. We are happy to clarify that this is not the case. This approach has similarities with the Koopman- operator based methods and the extended dynamic mode decomposition. We use a continuous formulation in the latent space that allows us to incorporate scarce and irregularly sampled training data. We applied our algorithm to three systems. First, we show that the algorithm is capable of exactly reproducing the solution of a linear ODE and to identify its eigenvalues. Second, we are applying the framework to a high-dimensional process generated by a complex latent dynamics, which is correctly identified. Third, we apply the algorithm to a Kuramoto Shivashinski (KS) equation. The results for the convergence of the parameters λ 1 and λ 2 can be found in Figure. We note that the proce proce of the model is trained for 5000 iterations using the Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 10 −3. The model is then used to make predictions of unseen states in the real world. We conclude that the model can be used to predict the future state of the economy. The model can also be used as a basis for the development of artificial intelligence. We trained the model for 200,000 iterations using Adam and a learning rate of 5 • 10 4 and assuming a five-dimensional latent space.

abstract

In this paper, we not only propose an new optimal sequential test of sum of logarithmic likelihood ratio (SLR) but also present the CUSUM sequential test (control chart, stopping time) with the observation-adjusted control limits (CUSUM-OAL) for monitoring quickly and adaptively the change in distribution of a sequential observations.
Two limiting relationships between the optimal test and a series of the CUSUM-OAL tests are established. Moreover, we give the estimation of the in-control and the out-of-control average run lengths (ARLs) of the CUSUM-OAL test. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations in detecting mean shifts of the observations sequence.

INTRODUCTION

In order to quickly detect a change in distribution of observations sequence without exceeding a certain false alarm rate, a great variety of sequential tests have been proposed, developed and applied to various fields since proposed a control chart method, see, for example, , , One of popular used sequential tests is the following upper-sided CUSUM test which was proposed by .
where c > 0 is a constant control limit, Z i = log[p v 1 (X i )/p v 0 (X i )], p v 0 (x) and p v 1 (x) are prechange and post-change probability density functions respectively for a sequence of mutually independent observations {X i , i ≥ 1}, that is, there is a unknown change-point τ ≥ 1 such that X 1 , ..., X τ −1 have the probability density function p v 0 , whereas, X τ , X τ +1 , ... have the probability density function p v 1 .
By the renewal property of the CUSUM test T C we have , where E 1 (T C ) is the out-of-control average run length (ARL 1 ), P k and E k denote the probability and expectation respectively when the change from p v 0 to p v 1 occurs at the change-point τ = k for k ≥ 1. Though we know that the CUSUM test is optimal under Lorden's measure (see Moustakides 1986 and Ritov 1990), the out-of-control ARL 1 of the CUSUM test is not small, especially in detecting small mean shifts ( see Table in Section 4).
In other words, the CUSUM test is insensitive in detecting small mean shifts. Then, how to increase the sensitivity of the CUSUM test ? Note that the control limit in the CUSUM test is a constant c which does not depend on the observation samples. Intuitively, if the control limit of the CUSUM test can become low as the samples mean of the observation sequence increases, then the alarm time of detecting the increasing mean shifts will be greatly shortened.
Based on this idea, by selecting a decreasing function g(x) we may define the ( upper-sided ) CUSUM chart T C (cg) with the observation-adjusted control limits cg( Ẑn ) ( abbreviated to the CUSUM-OAL chart ) in the following where c > 0 is a constant and Ẑn = n i=1 Z i /n. In other words, the control limits cg( Ẑn ) of the CUSUM-OAL test can be adjusted adaptively according to the observation information { Ẑn }.
Note that the control limits cg( Ẑn ) may be negative. In the special case, the CUSUM-OAL chart T C (cg) becomes into the conventional CUSUM chart T C (c) in (1) when g ≡ 1. Similarly, we can define a down-sided CUSUM-OAL test. In this paper, we consider only the upper-sided CUSUM-OAL test since the properties of the down-sided CUSUM-OAL test can be obtained by the similar method.
The main purpose of the present paper is to show the good detection performance of the CUSUM-OAL test and to give the estimation of its the in-control and out-of-control ARLs. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we first present an optimal SLR sequential test, then define two sequences of the CUSUM-OAL tests and prove that one of the two sequences of CUSUM-OAL tests converges to the optimal test, another sequences of CUSUM-OAL tests converges to a combination of the optimal test and the CUSUM test.
The estimation of the in-control and out-of-control ARLs of the CUSUM-OAL tests and their comparison are given in Section 3. The detection performances of the three CUSUM-OAL tests and the conventional CUSUM test are illustrated in Section 4 by comparing their numerical out-ofcontrol ARLs. Section 5 provides some concluding remarks.
Proofs of the theorems are given in the Appendix.

AN OPTIMAL SLR TEST, TWO CUSUM-OAL TESTS AND THEIR LIMITING RELATIONSHIPS

Let P 0 and E 0 denote the probability and the expectation respectively with the probability density p v 0 when there is no change for all the time. It is known that It follows from Proposition 2.38 in and (5.8)-(5.9) in Chow et al, P.108) that the following sequence test of sum of logarithmic likelihood ratio (SLR)
for B > 1, is optimal in the following sense min for P 0 (T SLR < ∞) = α, where c = log B and 0 < α < 1. In particular, if P 0 is the standard normal distribution with mean shift µ > 0 after changepoint, we have Z j − µ 0 = µX j , where µ 0 = −µ 2 /2. It follows from proposition 4 in that the SLR test T SLR in (4) is also optimal (minimal ARL 1 ) with the same false alarm probability P 0 (T < τ ).
It can be seen that the in-control average run length of T SLR is infinite, that is, ARL 0 = E 0 (T SLR ) = ∞. However, the minimal ARL 1 with finite ARL 0 is a widely used optimality criterion in statistical quality control (see ) and detection of abrupt changes (see . In order to get finite ARL 0 for T SLR , we replace the constant control limit c of T SLR in (3) or (4) with the dynamic control limit n(µ 0 − r) and obtain a modified SLR test T SLR (r) in the following
for r ≥ 0. For comparison, the in-control ARL 0 of all candidate sequential tests are constrained to be equal to the same desired level of type I error, the test with the lowest out-of-control ARL v has the highest power or the fastest monitoring (detection) speed. In the following example 1, the numerical simulations of the out-of-control ARLs of the CUSUM-OAL tests T C (cg u,0 ) in detecting the mean shifts of observations with normal distribution will be compared with that of the SLR tests T * (r) and T * (0), and that of the CUSUM-SLR test T C (c) ∧ T * (0) := min{T C (c), T * (0)} in the following Table .
These comparisons lead us to guess that there are some limiting relationships between T C (cg u,r ) and T * (r), and T C (c g u ) and T C (c) ∧ T * (0), respectively. Example 1. Let X 1 , X 2 , .... be mutually independent following the normal distribution N(0, 1) if there is no change. After the change-point τ = 1, the mean E µ (X k ) ( k ≥ 1 ) will change from v 0 = 0 to v = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 3. Here, we let
, where v 1 = 1 is a given reference value which for the CUSUM test is the magnitude of a shift in the process mean to be detected quickly. We conducted the numerical simulation based on 1,000,000 repetitions. The following Table lists the simulation results of the ARLs of the tests T C (c), T C (c g u ) for u = 1, 10, 10 2 , 10 3 , 10 4 , T * (0.0007), T C (c) ∧ T * (0) and T * (0) for detecting the mean shifts, where the mean shift 0.0 means that there is no change which corresponds to the in-control ARL 0 and all tests have the common ARL 0 ≈ 1000 except the test T * (0) which has ARL 0 = ∞.
The values in the parameters are the standard deviations of the tests. From the last row in Table , it's a little surprising that though the ARL 0 of T * (0) is infinite, that is, E 0 (T * (0)) = ∞, the detection speed of T * (0) is faster than that of the CUSUM chart T C for all mean shifts, in particular, for detecting the small mean shift 0.1, the speed of T * (0) is only 7.47 which is very faster than the speed, 439, of the CUSUM test.
Moreover, both control charts T * (0.0007) and T C (11.9271) ∧ T * (0) not only have the nearly same detection performance as T * (0) but also can have the finite in-control ARL 0 . Note particularly that when the number u in g u is taken from 0 to 1, 10, 10 2 , 10 3 , 10 4 , the detection speed of T C (c g u ) is getting faster and faster, approaching to that of T C (c) ∧ T * (0).
This inspires us to prove the following theoretic results. Let τ = 1 and {X k , k ≥ 1} be an i.i.d. observations sequence with Theorem 2 shows that when the constant control limit c of the CUSUM test T C (c) is replaced with the observation-adjusted control limits {cg u,r ( Ẑn )} and {c g u ( Ẑn )} respectively, the corresponding two CUSUM-OAL tests {T C (cg u,r )} and {T C (c g u )} will converge to the optimal SLR test T * (r) and the CUSUM-SLR test T C (c) ∧ T * (0) as u → ∞, respectively.
In other words, the fastest alarm times that {T C (cg u,r )} and {T C (c g u )} can be reached are T * (r) and T C (c) ∧ T * (0), respectively. u ≥ 0} can be seen as two ""long bridges"" connecting T C (c) and T * (r), and T C (c) and T C (c) ∧ T * (0), respectively.

ESTIMATION AND COMPARISON OF ARL OF THE CUSUM-OAL TEST

In this section we will give an estimation of the ARLs of the following CUSUM-OAL test that can be written as where g(.) is a decreasing function, Ẑn (ac x] denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. Here Ẑn (ac) is a sliding average of the statistics, Next we discuss on the the post-change probability distribution in order to estimate the ARLs of T C (cg).
Usually we rarely know the post-change probability distribution P v of the observation process before it is detected. But the possible change domain and its boundary (including the size and form of the boundary) about v may be determined by engineering knowledge, practical experience or statistical data.
So we may assume that the region of parameter space V and a probability distribution Q on V are known. If we have no prior knowledge of the possible value of v after the change time τ , we may assume that v occurs equally on V , that is, the probability distribution Q is an equal probability distribution (or uniform distribution ) on V .
For example, let P v be the normal distribution and v = (µ, σ), where µ and σ denote the mean and standard deviation respectively, we can take the set V = {(µ, σ) : and Q is subject to the uniform distribution U(V ) on V if v occurs equally on V , where the numbers µ 1 , µ 2 , σ 1 and σ 2 are known. It means that we know the domain of the possible post-change distributions, P v , v ∈ V , i.e., the boundary ∂V of the parameter space V is known.
Next we shall divide the parameter space V into three subsets V + , V 0 and V − by the Kullback-Leibler information distance. Let and are two Kullblak-Leibler information distances between P v , P v 0 and P v , P v 1 . Since I(p|q) = 0 if and only if p = q, where p and q are two probability measures, it follows that
, it means that P v is closer to P v 0 than to P v 1 according to the Kullblak-Leibler information distance. There is a similar explanation for v ∈ V + or ∈ V 0 . Suppose the post-change distribution P v and the function g(x) satisfy the following conditions: (I) The probability P v is not a point mass at E v (Z 1 ) and P v (Z 1 > 0) > 0.
(II) The moment-generating function h v (θ) = E v (e θZ 1 ) satisfies h v (θ) < ∞ for some θ > 0. (III) The function g(x) is decreasing, its second order derivative function g ′′ (x) is continuous and bounded, and there is a positive number x * such that g(x * ) = 0. ) and and therefore, Θ ′ (θ(u)) = −H(θ(u)) = −H(θ * v ) = 0, Θ ′ (θ(1/x)) > 0 for x > 1/u and Θ ′ (θ(1/x)) < 0 for x > 1/u.
Hence, there exists a positive number b defined in (??). It can be seen, the main part of ARL v (T c (g)) will be an exponential function, square function, and linear function of c when the process {Z k : k ≥ 0} has no change or a ""small change"", a ""medium change"" and a ""large change"" from P v 0 to P v , respectively.
Here, the ""small change"" (v ∈ V − ) means that P v is closer to P v 0 than to P v 1 , i.e., I(P v |P v 0 ) < I(P v |P v 1 ), and the ""large change"" is just the opposite. The ""medium change"" (v ∈ V 0 ) corresponds to In this paper, we will use another method to prove Theorem 3 since Wald's identity and the martingale method do not hold or can not work for showing the ARLs estimation of the test T c (g) when g is not constant.
Next we compare the detection performance of the CUSUM-OAL test (ARL v (T c ′ (g))) with that of the CUSUM test (ARL v (T C (c))) by using (??) in Theorem 4.1. ) when µ 0 < µ < 0 and for θ * v 0 > g(µ)/g(µ 0 ) when µ ≥ 0. This means that ARL v (T c (g)) can be smaller than ARL v (T C (c)) as long as g(µ)/g(µ 0 ) is small for all µ > µ 0 .

NUMERICAL SIMULATION AND A REAL EX-AMPLE ILLUSTRATION

4.1 Numerical Simulation of ARLs for τ ≥ 1 By the simulation results of ARLs in Table , we see that the detection performance of T * (r), T C (c)∧T * (0), T * (0) and T C (c g u ) for large u is much better than that of the conventional CUSUM test T C for τ = 1. The following Table illustrates the simulation values of E τ i ,v and J ACE of nine tests in detecting two mean shifts v = 0.1 and v = 1 after six change-points, τ i , 1 ≤ i ≤ 6 with ARL 0 (T ) = E 0 (T ) ≈ 500.
Note that H v (θ) is a convex function and H ′ v (0) = µ < 0. This means that there is a unique positive number . It follows from (A.9) that for a large c. Taking θ ց θ * v and u ′ ց u, we have for a large c. Thus, by (A.11) we have as c → ∞. By the properties of exponential distribution, we have for a large c.

Next we compare the detection performance of the CUSUM-OAL test (ARL v (T c ‼ (g)) with that of the CUSUMUM-V test (T C (c) (c))) by using (??) in Theorem 1. By the results of the simulation of ARL v, we see that the performance of T c is as long as g(gµ 0) is small for small values of v. We conclude that ARL can be smaller than ARL (T v (C c (T) c) (C) v (c c (t) c ) when the process {Z k : k ≥ 0} has no change or a ""small change"", a ""medium change"" and a ""large change"" from P v 0 to P v, respectively.

What happens to Ngotho after he attacks Jacobo at a workers' strike?,"Weep Not, Child is a 1964 novel by Kenyan author Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o. It was his first novel, published in 1964 under the name James Ngugi. It was among the African Writers Series. It was the first English language|English novel to be published by an East African. Thiong'o's works deal with the relationship between Africans and white settlers in colonial Kenya, and are heavily critical of colonial rule. Specifically, Weep Not, Child deals with the Mau Mau Uprising, and ""the bewildering dispossession of an entire people from their ancestral land."" Ngũgĩ wrote the novel while he was a student at Makerere University.

The book is divided into two parts and eighteen chapters. Part one deals mostly with the education of Njoroge, while part two deals with the rising Mau Mau movement.

Plot summary

Njoroge, a little boy, is urged to attend school by his mother. He is the first one of his family able to go to school. His family lives on the land of Jacobo, an African made rich by his dealings with white settlers, namely Mr. Howlands, the most powerful land owner in the area. Njoroge's brother Kamau works as an apprentice to a carpenter, while Boro, the eldest living son, is troubled by his experiences while in forced service during World War II, including witnessing the death of his elder brother. Ngotho, Njoroge's father and a respected man in the surrounding area, tends Mr. Howlands' crops, but is motivated by his passion to preserve his ancestral land, rather than for any compensation or loyalty.

One day, black workers call for a strike to obtain higher wages. Ngotho is ambivalent about participating in the strike because he fears he will lose his job. However, he decides to go to the gathering, even though his two wives do not agree. At the demonstration, there are calls for higher wages. Suddenly, the white police inspector brings Jacobo to the gathering to pacify the native people. Jacobo tries to put an end to the strike. Ngotho attacks Jacobo, and the result is a riot where two people are killed. Jacobo survives and swears revenge. Ngotho loses his job and Njoroge’s family is forced to move. Njoroge’s brothers fund his education and seem to lose respect for their father.

Mwihaki, Jacobo's daughter and Njoroge's best friend, enters a girls' only boarding school, leaving Njoroge relatively alone. He reflects upon her leaving, and realizes that he was embarrassed by his father's actions towards Jacobo. For this reason, Njoroge is not upset by her exit and their separation. Njoroge switches to another school.

For a time, everyone's attention is focused on the upcoming trial of Jomo Kenyatta – a revered leader of the movement. Many blacks think that he is going to bring forth Kenya’s independence. But Jomo loses the trial and is imprisoned. This results in further protests and greater suppression of the black population.

Jacobo and a white landowner, Mr. Howlands, fight against the rising activities of the Mau Mau, an organization striving for Kenyan economic, political, and cultural independence. Jacobo accuses Ngotho of being the leader of the Mau Mau and tries to imprison the whole family. Meanwhile, the situation in the country is deteriorating. Six black men are taken out of their houses and executed in the woods.

One day Njoroge meets Mwihaki again, who has returned from boarding school. Although Njoroge had planned to avoid her due to the conflict between their fathers, their friendship is unaffected. Njoroge passes an important exam that allows him to advance to High School. His village is proud of him, and collects money to pay Njoroge's High School tuition.

Several months later, Jacobo is murdered in his office by a member of the Mau Mau. Mr. Howlands has Njoroge removed from school for questioning. Both father and son are brutally beaten before release and Ngotho is left barely alive. Although there doesn't seem to be a connection between Njoroge's family and the murder, it is eventually revealed that Njoroge's brothers are behind the assassination, and that Boro is the real leader of the Mau Mau. Ngotho soon dies from his injuries and Njoroge finds out that his father was protecting his brothers. Kamau has been imprisoned for life. Only Njoroge and his two mothers remain free, and Njoroge is left as the sole provider of his two mothers. Njoroge fears that he cannot make ends meet; he gives up hope of continuing in school and loses faith in God.

Njoroge asks Mwihaki's for support, but she is angry because of her father’s death. When he finally pledges his love to her, she refuses to leave with him, realizing her obligation to Kenya and her mother. Njoroge decides to leave town and makes an attempt at suicide; however, he fails when his mothers find him before he is able to hang himself. The novel closes with Njoroge feeling hopeless, and ashamed of cowardice.

Characters in Weep Not, Child
 Njoroge: the main character of the book whose main goal throughout the book is to become as educated as possible.
 Ngotho: Njoroge's father. He works for Mr.Howlands and is respected by him until he attacks Jacobo at a workers strike. He is fired and the family is forced to move to another section of the country. Over the course of the book his position as the central power of the family weakened, to the point where his self-realization that he has spent his whole life waiting for the prophecy (that proclaims the blacks will be returned their land) to come true rather than fighting for Kenyan independence, leads to his depression.
 Nyokabi and Njeri: the two wives of Ngotho. Njeri is Ngotho's first wife, and mother of Boro, Kamau, and Kori. Nyokabi is his second wife, and the mother of Njoroge and Mwangi.
 Njoroge has four brothers: Boro, Kamau, Kori and Mwangi (who is Njoroge's only full brother, who died in World War II).
 Boro: Son of Njeri who fights for the Allies in World War II. Upon returning his anger against the colonial government is compounded by their confiscation of the his land. Boro's anger and position as eldest son leads him to question and ridicule Ngotho, which eventually defeats their father's will (upon realizing his life was wasted waiting and not acting). It is eventually revealed that Boro is the leader of the Mau Mau (earlier alluded to as ""entering politics"") and murders Mr.Howlands. He is caught by police immediately after and is scheduled to be executed by the book's end. It is highly likely that it is also Boro who kills Jacobo.
 Mwihaki: Njoroge's best friend (and later develops into his love interest). Daughter of Jacobo. When it is revealed that his family killed Jacobo (most likely Boro), Mwihaki distances herself from Njoroge, asking for time to mourn her father and care for her mother.
 Jacobo: Mwihaki's father and an important landowner. Chief of the village.
 Mr. Howlands: A white settler who emigrated to colonial Kenya and now owns a farm made up of land that originally belonged to Ngotho's ancestors. Has three children: Peter who died in World War II before the book's beginning, a daughter who becomes a missionary, and Stephen who met Njoroge while the two were in high school.

Themes and motifs
Weep Not, Child integrates Gikuyu mythology and the ideology of nationalism that serves as catalyst for much of the novel's action. The novel explores the negative aspects of colonial rule over Kenya. Njoroge's aspiration to attend university is frustrated by both the violence of the Mau Mau rebels and the violent response of the colonial government. This disappointment leads to his alienation from his family and ultimately his suicide attempt.

The novel also ponders the role of saviours and salvation. The author notes in his The River Between: ""Salvation shall come from the hills. From the blood that flows in me, I say from the same tree, a son shall rise. And his duty shall be to lead and save the people."" Jomo Kenyatta, the first prime minister of Kenya, is immortalised in Weep Not, Child. The author says, ""Jomo had been his (Ngotho's) hope. Ngotho had come to think that it was Jomo who would drive away the white man. To him, Jomo stood for custom and traditions purified by grace of learning and much travel."" Njoroge comes to view Jomo as a messiah who will win the struggle against the colonial government.

Where is the club's headquarters located?,"Football Club Urartu (, translated Futbolayin Akumb Urartu), commonly known as Urartu, is an Armenian professional football team based in the capital Yerevan that currently plays in the Armenian Premier League. The club won the Armenian Cup three times, in 1992, 2007 and 2016. In 2013–2014, they won the Armenian Premier League for the first time in their history.

In early 2016, the Russia-based Armenian businessman Dzhevan Cheloyants became a co-owner of the club after purchasing the major part of the club shares. The club was known as FC Banants until 1 August 2019, when it was officially renamed FC Urartu.

History

Kotayk
Urartu FC were founded as FC Banants by Sarkis Israelyan on 21 January 1992 in the village of Kotayk, representing the Kotayk Province. He named the club after his native village of Banants (currently known as Bayan). Between 1992 and 1995, the club was commonly referred to as Banants Kotayk. During the 1992 season, the club won the first Armenian Cup. At the end of the 1995 transitional season, Banants suffered a financial crisis. The club owners decided that it was better to merge the club with FC Kotayk of Abovyan, rather than disband it. In 2001, Banants demerged from FC Kotayk, and was moved from Abovyan to the capital Yerevan.

Yerevan

FC Banants was relocated to Yerevan in 2001. At the beginning of 2003, Banants merged with FC Spartak Yerevan, but was able to limit the name of the new merger to FC Banants. Spartak became Banants's youth academy and later changed the name to Banants-2. Because of the merger, Banants acquired many players from Spartak Yerevan, including Samvel Melkonyan. After the merger, Banants took a more serious approach and have finished highly in the league table ever since. The club managed to lift the Armenian Cup in 2007.
Experience is making way for youth for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. The departures of most of the experienced players have left the club's future to the youth. Along with two Ukrainian players, Ugandan international, Noah Kasule, has been signed.

The club headquarters are located on Jivani Street 2 of the Malatia-Sebastia District, Yerevan.

Stadium

The construction of the Banants Stadium was launched in 2006 in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, with the assistance of the FIFA goal programme. It was officially opened in 2008 with a capacity of 3,600 seats. Further developments were implemented later in 2011, when the playing pitch was modernized and the capacity of the stadium was increased up to 4,860 seats (2,760 at the northern stand, 1,500 at the southern stand and 600 at the western stand).

Training centre/academy
Banants Training Centre is the club's academy base located in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan. In addition to the main stadium, the centre houses 3 full-size training pitches, mini football pitches as well as an indoor facility. The current technical director of the academy is the former Russian footballer Ilshat Faizulin.

Fans
The most active group of fans is the South West Ultras fan club, mainly composed of residents from several neighbourhoods within the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, since the club is a de facto representer of the district. Members of the fan club benefit from events organized by the club and many facilities of the Banants training centre, such as the mini football pitch, the club store and other entertainments.

How do the runtimes and iteration counts of NFPA and FPSA compare to GMRES and DSA in the numerical experiments?,"\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}
\setcounter{equation}{0} 

Transport problems with highly forward-peaked scattering are prevalent in a variety of areas, including astrophysics, medical physics, and plasma physics \cite{HGK,aristova,multiphysics}.
For these problems, solutions of the transport equation converge slowly when using conventional methods such as source iteration (SI) \cite{adamslarsen} and the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) \cite{gmres}.
Moreover, diffusion-based acceleration techniques like diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA) \cite{alcouffe} and nonlinear diffusion acceleration (NDA) \cite{smithetall} are generally inefficient when tackling these problems, as they only accelerate up to the first moment of the angular flux \cite{JapanFPSA}.
In fact, higher-order moments carry important information in problems with highly forward-peaked scattering and can be used to further accelerate convergence \cite{japanDiss}.

This paper focuses on solution methods for the monoenergetic, steady-state transport equation in homogeneous slab geometry.
Under these conditions, the transport equation is given by
\begin{subequations}\label[pluraleq]{eq1}
\begin{equation}
\label{t1}
\mu\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \psi(x,\mu) + \sigma_t \psi(x,\mu) = \int_{-1}^{1} d\mu' \sigma_s(\mu,\mu') \psi(x,\mu') + Q(x, \mu), \,\,\, x\in [0, X],-1\leq\mu\leq 1  ,\\
\end{equation}
with boundary conditions
\begin{align}
\label{t2}
\psi(0,\mu) &= \psi_L(\mu), \quad \mu > 0,\\
\label{t3}
\psi(X,\mu) &= \psi_R(\mu), \quad \mu < 0.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Here, $\psi(x,\mu)$ represents the angular flux at position $x$ and direction $\mu$, $\sigma_t$ is the macroscopic total cross section, $\sigma_s(\mu,\mu')$ is the differential scattering cross section, and $Q$ is an internal source.

New innovations have paved the way to better solve this equation in systems with highly forward-peaked scattering.
For instance, work has been done on modified $P_L$ equations and modified scattering cross section moments to accelerate convergence of anisotropic neutron transport problems \cite{khattab}.
In order to speed up the convergence of radiative transfer in clouds, a quasi-diffusion method has been developed \cite{aristova}.
In addition, the DSA-multigrid method was developed to solve problems in electron transport more efficiently \cite{trucksin}.

One of the most recent convergence methods developed is Fokker-Planck Synthetic Acceleration (FPSA) \cite{JapanFPSA,japanDiss}.
FPSA accelerates up to $N$ moments of the angular flux and has shown significant improvement in the convergence rate for the types of problems described above.
The method returns a speed-up of several orders of magnitude with respect to wall-clock time when compared to DSA  \cite{JapanFPSA}.

In this paper, we introduce a new acceleration technique, called \textit{Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Acceleration} (NFPA).
This  method  returns  a  modified  Fokker-Planck (FP) equation  that  preserves  the  angular moments of the flux given by the transport  equation.
This preservation of moments is particularly appealing for applications to multiphysics problems \cite{multiphysics}, in which the coupling between the transport physics and the other physics can be done through the (lower-order) FP equation.
To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a numerical method that returns a Fokker-Planck-like equation that is discretely consistent with the linear Boltzmann equation.

This paper is organized as follows.
\Cref{sec2} starts with a brief description of FPSA.
Then, we derive the NFPA scheme.
In \cref{sec3}, we discuss the discretization schemes used in this work and present numerical results.
These are compared against standard acceleration techniques.
We conclude with a discussion in \cref{sec4}.

\section{Fokker-Planck Acceleration}\label{sec2}
\setcounter{equation}{0} 
In this section we briefly outline the theory behind FPSA, describe NFPA for monoenergetic, steady-state transport problems in slab geometry, and present the numerical methodology behind NFPA.
The theory given here can be easily extended to higher-dimensional problems.
Moreover, extending the method to energy-dependence shall not lead to significant additional theoretical difficulties.

To solve the transport problem given by \cref{eq1} we approximate the in-scattering term in \cref{t1} with a Legendre moment expansion:
\begin{equation}
\label{transport1}
\mu\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \psi(x,\mu) + \sigma_t \psi(x,\mu) = \sum_{l=0}^L \frac{(2l+1)}{2} P_l(\mu) \sigma_{s,l} \phi_l(x) + Q(x, \mu),
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
\label{transport2}
\phi_l(x) =  \int_{-1}^{1} d\mu P_l(\mu) \psi(x,\mu).
\end{equation}
Here, $\phi_l$ is the $l^{th}$ Legendre moment of the angular flux, $ \sigma_{s,l}$ is the $l^{th}$ Legendre coefficient of the differential scattering cross section,  and $P_l$ is the $l^{th}$-order Legendre polynomial.
For simplicity, we will drop the notation $(x,\mu)$ in the remainder of this section.

The solution to \cref{transport1} converges asymptotically to the solution of the following Fokker-Planck equation in the forward-peaked limit \cite{pomraning1}:
\begin{equation}
\label{fp1}
\mu\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} + \sigma_a \psi = \frac{\sigma_{tr}}{2}\frac{\partial }{\partial \mu} (1-\mu^2) \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \mu} + Q\,,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{tr}= \sigma_{s,0} -\sigma_{s,1}$ is the momentum transfer cross section and $\sigma_a = \sigma_t-\sigma_{s,0}$ is the macroscopic absorption cross section.

Source Iteration \cite{adamslarsen} is generally used to solve \cref{transport1}, which can be rewritten in operator notation:
\begin{equation}
\label{si1}
\mathcal{L} \psi^{m+1} = \mathcal{S} \psi^{m} + Q\,,
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \mu \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \sigma_t,
   \quad
\mathcal{S} = \sum_{l=0}^L \frac{(2l+1)}{2} P_l(\mu) \sigma_{s,l} \int_{-1}^{1}d\mu P_l(\mu) ,
\label{trans1}
\end{equation}
and $m$ is the iteration index.
This equation is solved iteratively until a tolerance criterion is met. The FP approximation shown in \cref{fp1} can be used to accelerate the convergence of \cref{transport1}.

\subsection{FPSA: Fokker-Planck Synthetic Acceleration}\label{FPSA}

In the FPSA scheme \cite{JapanFPSA,japanDiss}, the FP approximation is used as a preconditioner to synthetically accelerate convergence when solving \cref{transport1} (cf. \cite{adamslarsen} for a detailed description of synthetic acceleration).
When solving \cref{si1}, the angular flux at each iteration $m$ has an error associated with it.
FPSA systematically follows a predict, correct, iterate scheme.
A transport sweep, one iteration in \cref{si1}, is made for a prediction.
The FP approximation is used to correct the error in the prediction, and this iteration is performed until a convergence criterion is met.
The equations used are:
\begin{subequations}
\label{fpsaeq}
\begin{align}
\label{predict}
\mathrm{Predict}&: \mathcal{L} \psi^{m+\frac{1}{2}} = \mathcal{S} \psi^{m} + Q\,,\\
\label{correct}
\mathrm{Correct}&: \psi^{m+1} =  \psi^{m+\frac{1}{2}} + \mathcal{P}^{-1} \mathcal{S} \left( \psi^{m+\frac{1}{2}} -  \psi^{m}\right),
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where we define $\mathcal{P}$ as
\begin{equation}
\label{FPSAsi1}
\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{A}-\mathcal{F} =\underbrace{\left(\mu\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \sigma_a\right)}_\mathcal{A} - \underbrace{\left(\frac{\sigma_{tr}}{2}\frac{\partial }{\partial \mu} (1-\mu^2) \frac{\partial }{\partial \mu}\right)}_\mathcal{F},
\end{equation}
In this synthetic acceleration method, the FP approximation is used to correct the error in each iteration of the high-order (HO) equation (\ref{predict}). 
Therefore, there is no consistency between the angular moments of the flux in the HO and low-order (LO) equations.

\subsection{NFPA: Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Acceleration}\label{NFPA}

Similar to FPSA, NFPA uses the FP approximation to accelerate the convergence of the solution.
We introduce the additive term $\hat{D}_F$ to \cref{fp1}, obtaining the modified FP equation
\begin{equation}
\label{mfp1}
\mu\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} + \sigma_a \psi = \frac{\sigma_{tr}}{2}\frac{\partial }{\partial \mu} (1-\mu^2) \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \mu} + \hat{D}_F + Q\,.
\end{equation}
The role of $\hat{D}_F$ is to force the transport and modified FP equations to be consistent.
Subtracting \cref{mfp1} from \cref{transport1} and rearranging, we obtain the consistency term
\begin{equation}
\label{dfp}
\hat{D}_F = \sum_{l=0}^L \frac{(2l+1)}{2} P_l \sigma_l \phi_l - \frac{\sigma_{tr}}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} (1-\mu^2) \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \mu} - \sigma_{s,0} \psi\,.
\end{equation}

The NFPA method is given by the following equations:
\begin{subequations}\label[pluraleq]{holocons}
\begin{align}
\label{HO1}
\text{HO}&: \mu\frac{\partial \psi_{HO}}{\partial x} + \sigma_t \psi_{HO} = \sum_{l=0}^L \frac{(2l+1)}{2} P_l \sigma_l \phi_{l, LO} + Q\,,\\
\label{LO11}
\text{LO}&: \mu\frac{\partial \psi_{LO}}{\partial x} + \sigma_a \psi_{LO} = \frac{\sigma_{tr}}{2}\frac{\partial }{\partial \mu} (1-\mu^2) \frac{\partial \psi_{LO}}{\partial \mu} + \hat{D}_F + Q\,,\\
\label{con1}
\text{Consistency term}&: \hat{D}_F = \sum_{l=0}^L \frac{(2l+1)}{2} P_l \sigma_l \phi_{l, HO}^m - \frac{\sigma_{tr}}{2}\frac{\partial }{\partial \mu} (1-\mu^2) \frac{\partial \psi_{HO}}{\partial \mu} - \sigma_{s,0} \psi_{HO}\,,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\psi_{HO}$ is the angular flux obtained from the HO equation and $\psi_{LO}$ is the angular flux obtained from the LO equation.
The nonlinear HOLO-plus-consistency system given by \cref{holocons} can be solved using any nonlinear solution technique \cite{kelley}. Note that the NFPA scheme returns a FP equation that is consistent with HO transport. 
Moreover, this modified FP equation accounts for large-angle scattering which the standard FP equation does not. 
The LO equation (\ref{fp1}) can then be integrated into multiphysics models in a similar fashion to standard HOLO schemes \cite{patelFBR}. To solve the HOLO-plus-consistency system above, we use Picard iteration \cite{kelley}:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\label{H1}
\text{Transport Sweep for HO}&:
\mathcal{L} \psi_{HO}^{k+1} = \mathcal{S} \psi_{LO}^{k} + Q, \\
\label{L1}
\text{Evaluate Consistency Term}&: \hat{D}_F^{k+1} = \left(\mathcal{S} - \mathcal{F} - \sigma_{s,0}\mathcal{I}\right) \psi_{HO}^{k+1}, \\
\label{c1}
\text{Solve LO Equation}&: \psi_{LO}^{k+1} = \mathcal{P}^{-1} \left(\hat{D}_F^{k+1} + Q\right), 
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ are given in \cref{trans1}, $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ are given in \cref{FPSAsi1}, $\mathcal{I}$ is the identity operator, and $k$ is the iteration index.
Iteration is done until a convergence criterion is met.

The main advantage of setting up the LO equation in this fashion is that the stiffness matrix for LO needs to be setup and inverted \textit{only once}, just as with FPSA \cite{JapanFPSA, japanDiss}. This has a large impact on the method's performance.
A flowchart of this algorithm is shown in \cref{Nalgorithm}.

\section{Numerical Experiments}\label{sec3}

In \cref{sec31} we describe the discretization methods used to implement the algorithms.
In \cref{sec32} we provide numerical results for 2 different choices of source $Q$ and boundary conditions.
For each choice we solve the problem using 3 different scattering kernels, applying 3 different choices of parameters for each kernel.
We provide NFPA numerical results for these 18 cases and compare them against those obtained from FPSA and other standard methods.

All numerical experiments were performed using MATLAB.
Runtime was tracked using the tic-toc functionality \cite{matlab17}, with
only the solver runtime being taken into consideration in the comparisons.
A 2017 MacBook Pro with a 2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 and 16 GB of RAM was used for all simulations.


\subsection{Discretization}\label{sec31}

The Transport and FP equations were discretized using linear discontinuous finite element discretization in space \cite{mpd1}, and discrete ordinates (S$_N$) in angle \cite{landm}.
The Fokker-Planck operator $\mathcal{F}$ was discretized using moment preserving discretization (MPD) \cite{mpd1}.
Details of the derivation of the linear discontinuous finite element discretization can be seen in \cite{japanDiss,martin}.
The finite element discretization for the  Fokker-Planck equation follows the same derivation.

A brief review for the angular discretization used for the FP equation is given below.
First, we use Gauss-Legendre quadrature to discretize the FP equation in angle:
\begin{equation}
\mu_n\frac{\partial \psi_n(x)}{\partial x} + \sigma_a \psi_n(x) - \frac{\sigma_{tr}}{2}\nabla^2_n \psi_n(x) =  Q_n(x),
\end{equation}
for $n=1,..,N$.
Here, $\nabla^2_n$ term is the discrete form of the angular Laplacian operator evaluated at angle $n$.

The MPD scheme is then shown as
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2_n \psi_n = M \psi_n = V^{-1} L V \psi_n,
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the MPD discretized operator defined by
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
V_{i,j} = P_{i-1}(\mu_j)w_j,
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
L_{i,j} = -i(i-1),
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
for $i,j=1,...,N$.
Here, $P_l(\mu_j)$ are the Legendre polynomials evaluated at each angle $\mu_j$ and $w_j$ are the respective weights.
$M$ is defined as a (N x N) operator for a vector of $N$ angular fluxes $ \psi(x)$, at spatial location $x$. 

In summary, if we write the FP equation as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}(x) + \sigma_a \psi(x) - \mathcal{F} \psi(x) =  Q(x),
\end{equation}
then $\mathcal{H}$ is Diag$(\mu_n)$ for $n=1,...,N$, $Q(x)$ is a vector of source terms $Q_n(x)$, and $\mathcal{F}$ is represented by $\frac{\sigma_{tr}}{2}M$.


\subsection{Numerical Results}\label{sec32}

It is shown that for slowly converging problems, typical convergence methods like $L_\infty$ suffer from false convergence \cite{adamslarsen}.
To work around this issue, the criterion is modified to use information about the current and previous iteration:
\begin{equation}
\label{falseconverge}
\frac{|| \phi^{m}_0(x) - \phi^{m-1}_0(x) ||_2}{1-\frac{|| \phi^{m+1}_0(x) - \phi^{m}_0(x) ||_2}{|| \phi^{m}_0(x) - \phi^{m-1}_0(x) ||_2}} < 10^{-8}.
\end{equation}

Two problems were tested using 200 spatial cells, $X$ = 400, $\sigma_a = 0$, $L$ = 15, and $N$ = 16.
Problem 1 has vacuum boundaries and a homogeneous isotropic source $Q$ for $0 < x < X$.
Problem 2 has no internal source and an incoming beam at the left boundary. The source and boundary conditions used are shown in \cref{parameters}.

\end{tabular}}
\end{center}
\caption{Problem Parameters}
\label{parameters} 
\end{table} 
We consider three scattering kernels in this paper: Screened Rutherford \cite{pomraning1}, Exponential \cite{pomraning2}, and Henyey-Greenstein \cite{HGK}.
Three cases for each kernel were tested.
The results obtained with NFPA are compared with those obtained using GMRES, DSA, and FPSA with the MPD scheme.

\subsubsection{SRK: Screened Rutherford Kernel}

The Screened Rutherford Kernel \cite{pomraning1, JapanFPSA} is a widely used scattering kernel for modeling scattering behavior of electrons \cite{SRK}.
The kernel depends on the parameter $\eta$, such that
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{SRK}_{s,l} = \sigma_s  \int_{-1}^{1} d\mu P_l(\mu) \frac{\eta (\eta+1)}{(1+2\eta-\mu)^2}.
\end{equation}
The SRK has a valid FP limit as $\eta$ approaches 0 \cite{patelFBR}. Three different values of $\eta$ were used to generate the scattering kernels shown in \cref{SRK}.
GMRES, DSA, FPSA, and NFPA all converged to the same solution for problems 1 and 2. \Cref{SRK_plots} shows the solutions for SRK with $\eta = 10^{-7}$.

\caption{Runtime and Iteration Counts for Problem 2 with SRK}
\label{SRKresults2} 
\end{table}

The results of all solvers are shown in \cref{SRKresults1,SRKresults2}.
We see that NFPA and FPSA tremendously outperform GMRES and DSA in runtime for all cases.
FPSA is a simpler method than NFPA, requiring less calculations per iteration; therefore, it is expected that it outperforms NFPA in runtime.
We see a reduction in runtime and iterations for FPSA and NFPA as the FP limit is approached, with DSA and GMRES requiring many more iterations by comparison as $\eta$ approaches 0.

An advantage that NFPA offers is that the angular moments of the flux in the LO equation will remain consistent with those of the transport equation even as a problem becomes less forward-peaked.
On the other hand, the moments found using only the FP equation and source iteration lose accuracy.
To illustrate this, Problem 1 was tested using different Screened Rutherford Kernels with increasing $\eta$ parameters.
The percent errors (relative to the transport solution) for the scalar flux obtained with the LO equation and with the standard FP equation at the center of the slab are shown in \cref{momcomp}.
It can be seen that the percent relative errors in the scalar flux of the FP solution is orders of magnitude larger than the error produced using the LO equation.
The same trend can be seen when using the exponential and Henyey-Greenstein kernels.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{EK: Exponential Kernel}

The exponential kernel \cite{pomraning2, JapanFPSA} is a fictitious kernel made for problems that have a valid Fokker-Planck limit \cite{pomraning1}.
The zero$^{\text{th}}$ moment, $\sigma^{EK}_{s,0}$, is chosen arbitrarily; we define $\sigma^{EK}_{s,0}$ as the same zero$^{\text{th}}$ moment from the SRK.
The $\Delta$ parameter determines the kernel: the first and second moments are given by 
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\sigma^{EK}_{s,1} &= \sigma^{EK}_{s,0} (1-\Delta),\\
\sigma^{EK}_{s,2} &= \sigma^{EK}_{s,0} (1-3\Delta+3\Delta^2),
\end{align}
and the relationship for $l\geq 3$ is
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{EK}_{s,l} = \sigma^{EK}_{s,l-2} - \Delta(2l+1) \sigma^{EK}_{s,l-1}.
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
As $\Delta$ is reduced, the scattering kernel becomes more forward-peaked.

The EK has a valid FP limit as $\Delta$ approaches 0 \cite{patelFBR}.
Three different values of $\Delta$ were used to generate the scattering kernels shown in \cref{EXP}.
The generated scattering kernels are shown in \cref{EXP}.
GMRES, DSA, FPSA, and NFPA all converged to the same solution for problems 1 and 2.
\Cref{EK_plots} shows the solutions for EK with $\Delta = 10^{-7}$.

\end{figure}

The runtimes and iterations for GMRES, DSA, FPSA, and NFPA are shown in \cref{Expresults1,Expresults2}.
We see a similar trend with the EK as seen with SRK.
Smaller $\Delta$ values lead to a reduction in runtime and iterations for NFPA and FPSA, which greatly outperform DSA and GMRES in both categories.

\subsubsection{HGK: Henyey-Greenstein Kernel}

The Henyey-Greenstein Kernel \cite{HGK,JapanFPSA} is most commonly used in light transport in clouds.
It relies on the anisotropy factor $g$, such that
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{HGK}_{s,l} = \sigma_s g^l.
\end{equation}
As $g$ goes from zero to unity, the scattering shifts from isotropic to highly anisotropic.

\end{table}

Here we see that NFPA and FPSA do not perform as well compared to their results for the SRK and EK.
Contrary to what happened in those cases, both solvers require more time and iterations as the problem becomes more anisotropic.
This is somewhat expected, due to HGK not having a valid Fokker-Planck limit.
However, both NFPA and FPSA continue to greatly outperform GMRES and DSA.
Moreover, NFPA outperforms FPSA in iteration count for problem 1.


\section{Discussion}\label{sec4}

This paper introduced the Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Acceleration technique for steady-state, monoenergetic transport in homogeneous slab geometry.
To our knowledge, this is the first nonlinear HOLO method that accelerates \textit{all $L$ moments} of the angular flux.
Upon convergence, the LO and HO models are consistent; in other words, the (lower-order) modified Fokker-Planck equation \textit{preserves the same angular moments} of the flux obtained with the (higher-order) transport equation.

NFPA was tested on a homogeneous medium with an isotropic internal source with vacuum boundaries, and in a homogeneous medium with no internal source and an incoming beam boundary.
For both problems, three different scattering kernels were used.
The runtime and iterations of NFPA and FPSA were shown to be similar.
They both vastly outperformed DSA and GMRES for all cases by orders of magnitude.
However, NFPA has the feature of preserving the angular moments of the flux in both the HO and LO equations, which offers the advantage of integrating the LO model into multiphysics models. 

In the future, we intend to test NFPA capabilities for a variety of multiphysics problems and analyze its performance.
To apply NFPA to more realistic problems, it needs to be extended to include time and energy dependence. 
Additionally, the method needs to be adapted to address geometries with higher-order spatial dimensions.
Finally, for the NFPA method to become mathematically ``complete"", a full convergence examination using Fourier analysis must be performed.
However, this is beyond the scope of this paper and must be left for future work.

The method returns a speed-up of several orders of magnitude with respect to wall-clock time when compared to DSA. This method is particularly appealing to multiphysics problems in which the coupling between the transport physics and other physics can be done through the lower-order Fokker-Planck equation. This paper is organized as a discretization of the schemes used in this scheme, which can be found at the bottom of the page. For more information on the scheme, see the discretization of the FPSA scheme at the end of the article. The discussion of this scheme in this paper is also available at the http://www.japandiss.org/japan-physicists/fpsa-discussion-of-the- scheme-discussed-in-this-paper at-the end-of the article and at the top of the page for more information about the scheme and its discussions at the end of this  article as well as at the beginning of this article. The theory given here can be easily extended to higher-dimensional problems. Extending the method to energy-dependence shall not lead to significant additional theoretical difficulties. The solution to the transport problem converges to the solution of the following Fokker-Planck equation in the forward-peaked limit. The FP approximation shown in this section can be used to accelerate the convergence of \cref{transport1}. And the method can be extended to solve other types of transport problems, such as the air-sea transport problem. The method can also be applied to the problem of air-to-air transport. It can be adapted to solve problems in the air, sea, and space. The NFPA is a systematic approach to solving transport problems. It is based on the FPSA Synthetic Acceleration Acceleration scheme, developed by Japan and the U.S. in the 1970s and 1980s. For more information, see: http://www.fpsa.org/features/fpsA-synthetic-acceleration-scheme-and-technique/fPSA-Synthesis-A-FPSA.html#fpsc_A-S-S, fpsc_S-A, fsc_S, psc_s, pasc_s. erate the convergence of the solution. We introduce the additive term $D_F$ to the modified FP equation to force the transport and modified FP equations to be consistent. The LO equation can then be integrated into multiphysics models in a similar fashion to standard HOLO schemes. The nonlinear HOLO-plus-consistency system given by the NFPA method can be solved using any nonlinear solution technique. The NFPA scheme returns a FP equation that is consistent with HO transport. It accounts for large-angle scattering which the standard FP equation does not. We use Picard iteration to solve the HOLO plus Consistency problem. We also use the Picard iteration for the LO equation. We conclude that this method is a good solution to the problem of HO transport and LO transport. We call this method the ‘Transport Sweep Sweep’. We then call the LO Sweep ‘Consistency’ method to solve for LO transport in the same way as the transport Sweep. We end up with a LO equation that can be used to solve LO transport and HO transport in a number of different ways. The method is called ‘The LO Sweep Method’ and it is based on the Picard iterations of the Holocons method. It can be found at: http://www.patelFBR.com/holocons. ath [line] (init) -- (transport)    \path [ line] (decide) -- node {no} (dterm) --  (MFP)  (moments) -- Node {yes}(stop) -- nodes $i-1, $j-1. We use 3 different scattering kernels, applying 3 different choices of parameters for each kernel. We provide NFPA numerical results for these 18 cases and compare them against those obtained from FPSA and other standard methods. All numerical experiments were performed using MATLAB. A 2017 MacBook Pro with a 2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 and 16 GB of RAM was used for all simulations. We used Gauss-Legendre quadrature to discretize the FP equation in angle. The Fokker-Planck operator was discretized using moment preserving discretization (MPD) The MPD scheme is then shown as the MPD discreted operator defined by $M$ for $n=1,..,N$ and $P_j$ are the respective weights$M$ is defined as a (N) operator for a vector of angular flux at a spatial location $x. We then write theFP equation as if we had written it as follows: We consider three scattering kernels in this paper: Screened Rutherford, Exponential, and Henyey-Greenstein. Three cases for each kernel were tested. Results obtained with NFPA are compared with those obtained using GMRES, DSA, and FPSA with the MPD scheme. Three different values of $\eta$ were used to generate the scattering kernels shown in \cref{SRK}. The kernels all converged to the same solution for problems 1 and 2. The SRK has a valid FP limit as $\eta$ approaches 0 \cite{patelFBR}. The kernel depends on the parameter $\eta$, such that it can be used to model scattering behavior of electrons. The kernel is a widely used scattering kernel for modeling scattering behaviour of electrons in the environment. The kernels can also be used as a model for scattering behavior in the atmosphere. The results for the kernels are shown in the figure below. They are based on the results from a study published in the Journal of Scattering and Scattering Theory (JSC Theory) in 2008. The study was based on an earlier version of this article that was published in JSC Theory (2008) in which the kernel was used as the basis for a model of scattering behavior for electrons in an atmosphere. The percent relative errors in the scalar flux of the FP solution is orders of magnitude larger than the error produced using the LO equation. The same trend can be seen when using the exponential and Henyey-Greenstein kernels. The exponential kernel is a fictitious kernel made for problems that have a valid Fokker-Planck limit. The EK has a valid FP limit as $\Delta$ approaches 0. The runtimes and iterations for GMRES, DSA, FPSA, and NFPA are shown in \cref{Expresults1,Expresults2,Exp2) The generated scattering kernels for EK all converged to the same solution for problems 1 and 2. We see a similar trend as seen with the EK results with smaller $\Delta values lead to a reduction in the runtimes of the kernels. In both categories, GMRES and DSA outperform DSA and FPSA in both categories. We also see that the DSA kernels outperform the FPSA kernels in both the GMRES category and the NFPA category. We conclude that EK can be used as a basis for the development of a new algorithm to solve the problem of how to measure the density of a slab. The algorithm is based on the theory of density. e Henyey-Greenstein Kernel is most commonly used in light transport in clouds. It relies on the anisotropy factor $g$, such that $g$ goes from zero to unity, the scattering shifts from isotropic to highly anisotropic. The HGK does not have a valid FP limit. The three kernels tested are shown in \cref{HGK}. They all converged to the same solution for problems 1 and 2. The solution for problem 1 is shown in the figure below. The solutions for problems 2 and 3 are also shown. The results of each solver are show in the figures below as well as the results of the kernels tested for each problem. The kernel solution for Problem 1 is the same as that for Problem 2. It is also the same for Problem 3, but the kernels are not shown in this figure because the kernels were not tested for that problem. For problem 2, the solution is shown as the solution to the problem with $g = 0.99$. The solution to Problem 3 is the solution for $g=0.95$. For Problem 4, the solutions are shown as $ g = 0,0,0.9, and $ g= 0.95. For Problem 5, the Solution is the Solution to the Problem 1 problem with the same result as the Problem 2 solution. ariety of multiphysics problems and analyze its performance.

Her research interests are focussed on agricultural practices in the later prehistoric and Roman period and the utilisation of archaeobotanical data to investigate human-plant relationships.
The practices of data sharing, data citation and data reuse are all crucial aspects of the reproducibility of archaeological research. This article builds on the small number of studies reviewing data sharing and citation practices in archaeology, focussing on the data-rich sub-discipline of archaeobotany. Archaeobotany is a sub-discipline built on the time-intensive collection of data on archaeological plant remains, in order to investigate crop choice, crop husbandry, diet, vegetation and a wide range of other past human-plant relationships. Within archaeobotany, the level and form of data sharing is currently unknown. This article first reviews the form of data shared and the method of data sharing in 239 articles across 16 journals which present primary plant macrofossil studies. Second, it assesses data-citation in meta-analysis studies in 107 articles across 20 journals. Third, it assesses data reuse practices in archaeobotany, before exploring how these research practices can be improved to benefit the rigour and reuse of archaeobotanical research.

Archaeology is a discipline built on the production and analysis of quantitative data pertaining to past human behaviour. As each archaeological deposit is a unique occurrence, ensuring that the data resulting from excavation and analysis are preserved and accessible is crucially important. Currently, there is a general perception of a low level of data sharing and reuse. Such a low level of data availability would prevent the assessment of research findings and the reuse of data in meta-analysis (Kansa & Kansa 2013; Moore & Richards 2015). As observed across scientific disciplines, there is a major problem in the reproduction of scientific findings, commonly known as the ‘replication crisis’ (Costello et al. 2013). A range of intersecting debates contribute to this, including access to academic findings (open access), open data, access to software and access to methodologies, which can be broadly grouped as open science practices. Without these, the way that scientific findings can be verified and built upon is impaired. Questions of reproducibility have been raised in recent years in archaeology, with considerations of a range of practices which can improve the reproducibility of findings, and a recent call for the application of open science principles to archaeology (Marwick et al. 2017). Discussion has so far focussed on access to grey literature (Evans 2015), data sharing (Atici et al. 2013), data citation practices (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018) and computational reproducibility (Marwick 2017), with a focus on lithics, zooarchaeological evidence, and archaeological site reports.
Quantitative assessments of current levels of data sharing, data citation and reuse remain limited in archaeology. The focus of evaluation has been on the uptake of large-scale digital archives for the preservation and dissemination of digital data, such as the Archaeology Data Service (ADS), utilised by developer-led and research projects, and recommended for use by many research funders in the UK (Richards 2002; Wright and Richards 2018). Much less focus has been paid to the data-sharing practices of individuals or small-groups of university-based researchers who may be disseminating their research largely through journal articles. Recent work on the availability of data on lithics assemblages found a low level of data sharing (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018) and there are perceptions of low levels of data reuse (Huggett 2018; Kintigh et al. 2018). Within zooarchaeology numerous studies have explored issues of data sharing and reuse (Kansa & Kansa 2013, 2014), and the sub-discipline is seen as one of the most advanced areas of archaeology in regards to open science (Cooper & Green 2016: 273). Beyond zooarchaeology, however, explicit discussion has remained limited.
This paper assesses data sharing and reuse practices in archaeology through the case study of archaeobotany – a long established sub-discipline within archaeology which has well-established principles of data recording. Archaeobotany is an interesting case study for data sharing in archaeology as it straddles the division of archaeology between scientific and more traditional techniques. Quantitative data on archaeological plant remains are also of interest to a range of other fields, including ecology, environmental studies, biology and earth sciences. The key issues of data sharing and data reuse (Atici et al. 2013) have been touched upon in archaeobotany over the past decade within broader discussions on data quality (Van der Veen, Livarda & Hill 2007; Van der Veen, Hill & Livarda 2013). These earlier studies focussed on the quality and availability of archaeobotanical data from developer-funded excavations in Britain and Cultural Resource Management in North America (Vanderwarker et al. 2016: 156). However, no discussion of data-sharing and reuse in academic archaeobotany occurred. A recent review of digital methods in archaeobotany is the notable exception, with discussions of the challenges and methods of data sharing (Warinner & d’Alpoim Guedes 2014).
Currently, we have no evidence for the levels of data sharing and reuse within archaeobotany. This article provides the first quantitative assessment of 1) data publication in recent archaeobotanical journal articles 2) data citation in recent archaeobotanical meta-analysis 3) the reuse of archaeobotanical datasets, in order to assess whether practices need to change and how such changes can take place.
2. Data Publication and Re-use Practices in Archaeobotany
2.1. History of data production and publication
Archaeobotanical data falls within the category of observational data in archaeology (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018). Archaeobotanical data is considered as the quantitative assessment of plant macrofossils present within a sample from a discrete archaeological context, which can include species identification, plant part, levels of identification (cf. – confer or “compares to”), and a range of quantification methods including count, minimum number of individuals, levels of abundance and weight (Popper 1988). Archaeobotanical data is usually entered into a two-way data table organised by sample number. Alongside the counts of individual taxa, other information is also necessary to interpret archaeobotanical data, including sample volume, flot volume, charcoal volume, flot weight, level of preservation, sample number, context number, feature number, feature type and period. Beyond taxonomic identifications, a range of other types of data are increasingly gathered on individual plant macrofossils (morphometric measurements, isotopic values, aDNA).
Archaeobotanical training places a strong emphasis on recording data on a sample-by-sample basis (Jacomet & Kreuz 1999: 138–139; Jones & Charles 2009; Pearsall 2016: 97–107). Time-consuming methodologies utilised in the pursuit of accurate sample-level data recording include sub-sampling and splitting samples into size fractions and counting a statistically useful number of items per sample (Van der Veen & Fieller 1982). The creation of sample-level data means analysis is often undertaken on the basis of individual samples, for instance the assessment of crop-processing stages and weed ecological evidence for crop husbandry practices. The analysis of sample level data also enables archaeobotanical finds to be integrated alongside contextual evidence from archaeological sites. Requirements for the publication of this data are in place in some archaeological guidelines, for instance current Historic England guidelines for archaeological practice in England (Campbell, Moffett & Straker 2011: 8).
From the earliest archaeobotanical reports, such as Reid’s work at Roman Silchester, the sample from which plant remains were recovered was noted (Lodwick 2017a), but often results were reported as a list of taxa, or long catalogues of detailed botanical descriptions with seed counts, such as Knörzer’s work at Neuss (Knörzer 1970). Early systematic archaeobotanical reports displayed data within in-text tables, for example Jones’s work at Ashville (Jones 1978) and the two-way data table has been the standard form of reporting archaeobotanical data ever since. Often data tables are presented within book chapters or appendices, but the financial, space and time constraints of book publishing are limiting. Furthermore, there is the perception that specialist data was not necessary for publication (Barker 2001). Hence, alternative methods of the dissemination of specialist archaeological data were pursued in the later twentieth century.
From the 1980s, archaeobotanical data tables were often consigned to microfiche following a Council for British Archaeology and Department of Environment report (Moore & Richards 2015: 31), with the example of the excavation of Roman Colchester where the contents of all archaeobotanical samples were available on microfiche (Murphy 1992). An alternative in the 2000s was providing data tables on CD Rom as seen, for instance, in the CD accompanying the study of a Roman farmstead in the Upper Thames Valley (Robinson 2007) or the One Poultry excavations in London (Hill and Rowsome 2011). Meanwhile, the inception of the Archaeology Data Service, a digital repository for heritage data, in 1996 meant archaeological datasets were increasingly digitally archived, for instance the data from the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Project (Foreman 2018) or a recent large-scale research excavation at Silchester (University of Reading 2018). In these cases, archaeobotanical data is available to download as a .csv file.
Whilst the data publication strategy of large excavations was shifting, the availability of data from post-excavation assessment reports has remained challenging. So-called ‘grey literature’ results from the initial evaluation stage of developer-funded investigations and accompanying post-excavation assessment often contain a semi-quantitative evaluation of archaeobotanical samples on a scale of abundance. Whilst paper reports were initially deposited with county Historic Environment Records, a process of digitisation focussing on the Roman period has meant many pdfs are now available through the ADS (Allen et al. 2018), whilst born-digital reports are now deposited through OASIS (Online AccesS to the Index of archaeological investigationS), as part of the reporting process (Evans 2015), althought the extent to which specialist appendices are included is variable.
These varying ‘publication’ strategies means archaeobotanical data is often available somewhere for recent developer-funded excavations and large-scale developer-funded excavations, even if much of this data is as a printed table or .pdf file (Evans 2015; Evans and Moore 2014). However, academic journals are typically perceived as the most high-status publication venue for archaeobotanical data, and a crucial publication venue for academics in order to comply with institutional requirements and the norms of career progression. Aside from the problem of access to pay-walled journals by those without institutional subscriptions to all journals, the publication of primary data alongside research articles faces various problems, from the outright lack of inclusion of data, to problematic curation of supplementary data and a lack of peer review of data (Costello et al. 2013; Warinner and d’Alpoim Guedes 2014: 155; Whitlock, 2011). The extent of these problems for archaeobotany is currently unknown. Given the growth in archaeobotanical data production as methodologies are introduced into many new regions and periods over the last decade, it is vital that we know whether the mass of new data being produced is made available and is being reused.
Recent important advances within archaeobotanical data sharing have focussed on the construction of the ARBODAT database, developed by Angela Kreuz at the Kommission für Archäologische Landesforschung in Hessen. The database is used by a range of researchers in Germany, the Czech Republic, France and England (Kreuz & Schäfer 2002). Data sharing enabled by the use of this database has facilitated research on Neolithic agriculture in Austria, Bulgaria and Germany (Kreuz et al. 2005), and Bronze Age agriculture in Europe (Stika and Heiss 2012). The use of this database makes data integration between specialists easier due to the shared data structure and metadata description, but often the primary archaeobotanical data is not made publicly available.
2.2. Meta-analysis in archaeobotany
Beyond the need to preserve information, a key reason for the formal sharing of archaeobotanical data is in its reuse to facilitate subsequent research. There has been a long-standing concern within archaeobotany with the need to aggregate datasets and identify temporal and spatial patterns. The palaeobotanist Clement Reid maintained his own database of Quaternary plant records in the late nineteenth century (Reid 1899), which formed the foundation of Godwin’s Quaternary database (Godwin 1975). Mid-twentieth century studies of prehistoric plant use compiled lists of archaeobotanical materials incorporating full references and the location of the archive (Jessen & Helbaek 1944). The International Work Group for Palaeoethnobotany was itself founded in 1968 in part with the aim to compile archaeobotanical data, first realised through the publication of Progress in Old World Palaeoethnobotany (Van Zeist, Wasylikowa & Behre 1991), and subsequently through the publication of annual lists of new records of cultivated plants (Kroll 1997).
To take England as an example, regional reviews produced by state heritage authorities have provided catalogues of archaeobotanical datasets in particular time periods and regions (e.g. Murphy 1998). When one archaeobotanist has undertaken the majority of study within a region, pieces of synthesis within books have provided a relatively comprehensive review, for instance in the Thames Valley, UK (Lambrick & Robinson 2009). Over the last decade regional synthesis has occurred within several funded reviews which produced catalogues of sites with archaeobotanical data (Lodwick 2014; McKerracher 2018; Parks 2012) and a series of funded projects in France have enabled regional synthesis (Lepetz & Zech-Matterne 2017). However, many of these reviews are not accompanied by an available underlying database, and draw upon reports which are themselves hard to access.
Through the 1990s and 2000s, a series of databases were constructed in order to collate data from sites in a particular region and facilitate synthetic research. However, these databases have all placed the role of data archiving onto later projects specifically funded to collate data, rather than sourcing datasets at the time of publication. Such a model is unsustainable, and is unlikely to result in all available datasets being compiled. The Archaeobotanical Computer Database (ABCD), published in 1996 in the first issue of Internet Archaeology, contained much of the archaeobotanical data from Britain available at the time of publication, largely at the level of individual samples. The database was compiled between 1989 and 1994 and is still accessible through the accompanying online journal publication (Tomlinson & Hall 1996). The ABCD made major contributions to recent reviews of the Roman and Medieval periods (Van der Veen, Livarda & Hill 2008; Van der Veen, Hill & Livarda 2013). However, the database could only be centrally updated, with the online resource remaining a static version, lacking much of the new data produced subsequent to the implementation of PPG16 in 1990. The ADEMNES database, created through a research project undertaken at the Universities of Freiburg and Tübingen, contains data from 533 eastern Mediterranean and Near Eastern sites (Riehl & Kümmel 2005). Kroll has maintained the Archaeobotanical Literature Database to accompany the Vegetation History and Archaeobotany articles (Kroll 2005) now accessible as a database (Kirleis & Schmültz 2018). Numerous other databases have collated archaeobotanical studies, including the COMPAG project (Fuller et al. 2015), the Cultural Evolution of Neolithic Europe project (Colledge 2016), RADAR in the Netherlands (van Haaster and Brinkkemper 1995), BRAIN Botanical Records of Archaeobotany Italian Network (Mercuri et al. 2015) and CZAD – Archaeobotanical database of Czech Republic (CZAD 2019).
The majority of databases have a restricted regional coverage, whilst research-project driven period-specific databases provide overlapping content. Whilst there are a wide range of archaeobotanical databases available, few contain primary datasets (other than the ABCD) which can be downloaded as .csv files. Data which is most commonly available are bibliographic references per site, with some indications of mode of preservation, quantity of archaeobotanical data, and sometimes taxa present. The databases do not inter-relate to each other, and function primarily as bibliographic sources enabling researchers to find comparative sites or to identify published datasets which need to be re-tabulated prior to meta-analysis. The IWGP website curates a list of resources, but otherwise the resources are often disseminated through the archaeobotany jiscmail list.
Beyond the aim of cataloguing archaeobotanical data within a region and period, meta-analysis is often used in archaeobotany to identify spatial and chronological trends in a range of past human activities, for instance crop choice, crop husbandry practices, plant food consumption, the trade in luxury foods or the use of plants in ritual. Meta-analysis can be undertaken on the basis of simple presence/absence data per site, but in order for such analysis to be rigorous and comparable, sample-level data must be utilised. For instance, sample-level data is required for meta-studies, in order to identify high-quality samples of unmixed crops for weed ecology analysis (Bogaard 2004), to assess the importance of context in the evaluation of wild plant foods (Wallace et al. 2019), or to use volumetric measurements as a proxy for scale (Lodwick 2017b). The reuse of archaeobotanical data also extends to include datasets used as “controls” in commonly used forms of statistical analysis, for instance Jones’s weed data from Amorgos, Greece, which is utilised as a control group in discriminant analysis of crop-processing stage (Jones 1984), and ethnographic observations of crop items in different crop-processing stages (Jones 1990).
2.3. Open data principles and solutions
Debates over issues of data publication and meta-analysis have been on-going across scientific disciplines over the last decade (Editors 2009), and have been summarised within principles of open science, as recently set out in relation to archaeology (Marwick et al. 2017). Open Data is one of the three core principles for promoting transparency in social science (Miguel et al. 2014). The FAIR principles, developed by representatives from academia, industry, funding agencies, industry and publishers, provide four principles which data sharing should meet for use by both humans and machines – Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (Wilkinson et al. 2016). A recent report assessing the adoption and impact of FAIR principles across academia in the UK included archaeology as a case study (Allen and Hartland 2018: 46). It reported how the ADS was often used to archive data, but that “The journal itself provides the “story” about the data, the layer that describes what the data is, how it was collected and what the author thinks it means.” The report also raises the problem that smaller projects may not have the funding to utilise the ADS, meaning that other repositories are utilised. Increasingly, archaeological data is made available through a wide range of data repositories (OSF, Mendeley Data, Zenodo, Open Context), university data repositories (e.g. ORA-Data), or social networking sites for academics (Academia.edu, ResearchGate). More widely in archaeology, some have observed that archaeological data is rarely published (Kintigh et al. 2014), and recent reviews have reported low levels of data sharing (Huggett 2018; Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018). A closely related issue is that of data reuse. Responsible reuse of primary data encourages the sharing of primary data (Atici et al. 2013), but levels of data reuse in archaeology are thought to remain low (Huggett 2018). Principles for responsible data citation in archaeology have recently been developed summarising how datasets should be cited (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018).
In order to assess the current status of data sharing, citation and data re-use in archaeobotany, a review was undertaken of the publication of primary data and the publication of meta-analysis in major archaeological journals over the last ten years, building on recent pilot studies within archaeology (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018). The review of academic journals provided a contrast to recent assessments of archaeobotanical data deriving from developer-funded archaeology (Lodwick 2017c; Van der Veen, Hill & Livarda 2013). Journal articles have been selected as the focus of this study as the provision of online supplementary materials in the majority of journals and the ability to insert hyperlinks to persistent identifiers (eg a DOI) to link to datasets available elsewhere should not limit the publication of data and references. Much archaeobotanical data is also published elsewhere, especially from projects not based in the university sector, that is commercial or community archaeology in the UK. Archaeobotanical datasets emanating from this research are more commonly published through monographs, county journal articles, and unpublished (or grey literature) reports, but these are beyond the scope of the current review.
All journal articles were included which represent the principle reporting of a new archaeobotanical assemblage. The selected journals fall within three groups. First, what is considered the specialist archaeobotanical journal (Vegetation History and Archaeobotany (VHA)). Second, archaeological science journals (Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, Environmental Archaeology, The Holocene, Journal of Archaeological Science (JAS), Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports (JASR), Journal of Ethnobiology, Quaternary International, Journal of Wetland Archaeology), which can be considered as specialist sub-disciplinary journals which should be maintaining data-quality. Third, general archaeology journals (Antiquity, Journal of Field Archaeology, Oxford Journal of Archaeology, Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, Journal of World Prehistory). Finally, the broader cross-disciplinary journals PLoS One and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) were included. Published articles from the past ten years (2009–2018) have been analysed in order to assess the availability of plant macrofossil data. This ten-year period brackets the period where most archaeological journals have moved online and adopted supplementary materials.
Data citation in synthetic studies has been assessed in the same range of publications. The extent of data reuse ranges from the analysis of whole sample data to the presence/absence of individual crops. The location of a data citation has been assessed in the same range of publications, with the addition of journals where occasional research incorporating archaeobotanical data is featured (Britannia, Journal of Archaeological Research, Ethnobiology Letters, Medieval Archaeology, Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society, World Archaeology). The underlying dataset for the analysis is available in Lodwick 2019.
4.1. Primary data sharing
Here, the location of primary archaeobotanical data, that is sample level counts of macroscopic plant remains, was assessed for 239 journal articles across 16 journals (Lodwick 2019 Table 1). Figure 1 shows the results grouped by journal. Overall, only 56% of articles shared their primary data. In, Antiquity, JAS, JASR, PLOS One, Quaternary International and VHA, the highest proportion of publications did not include their primary data, that is to say that the sample-by-sample counts of plant macrofossils was not available. This level of data is comparable to the findings of other pilot studies in archaeology. Marwick and Pilaar Birch found a data sharing rate of 53% from 48 articles published in Journal of Archaeological Science in Feb – May 2017 (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018: 7), and confirm previous assertions that data is often withheld in archaeology (Kansa 2012: 499). This is better than some disciplines, with a 9% data sharing rate on publication found across high impact journal science publications (n = 500) (Alsheikh-Ali et al. 2011) and 13% in biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics (n = 4370) (Womack 2015), yet still indicates that nearly half of articles did not include primary data. Primary archaeobotanical data is more likely to be shared in archaeobotanical and archaeological science journals than general archaeology journals. However, within the primary archaeobotanical journal, VHA, 51% of articles do not include their primary data (Figure 1).
Chart showing the location of primary archaeobotanical data by journal in primary archaeobotanical data publications.
Where primary data was not shared, the data which was available ranged from summary statistics, typically counts or frequencies, reported either by site, site phase, or feature group. Figure 2 summarises these results by year, showing that there is a gradient within articles not sharing their full ‘raw’ data, from those only provided sample counts on one aspect of the archaeobotanical assemblage, to those only presenting data graphically or within discussion. Beyond full data, the most common form of data shared is either summary counts per site or summary counts per feature or phase. Whilst this data does enable some level of reuse, the results of any sample-level data analysis presented within an article cannot be verified, and the data cannot be reused for crop-processing or weed ecology analysis which requires sample level data. Furthermore, such data would have been collected on a sample-by-sample basis, but this information is lost from the resulting publication.
Chart showing the form of archaeobotanical data shared by year in primary archaeobotanical data publications.
The forms in which data are made available vary across journals. The sharing of primary data within an article remains the most common data sharing form in archaeobotany (Figure 1). Data tables in text require manual handling to extract data, in journals such as VHA, whilst in other journals in-text tables can be downloaded as .csv files. These however would not be citable as a separate dataset. Supplementary datasets are the third most common form of data sharing. Indeed, the use of electronic supplementary material has been advocated recently for by some journals, such as the Journal of Archaeological Science (Torrence, Martinón-Torres & Rehren 2015). Microsoft Excel spreadsheets are the most common form of supplementary data, followed by .pdfs and then word documents (Figure 1). Both .xlsx and .docx are proprietary file formats, and not recommended for long term archiving or open science principles. There is no indication of improvement over the last decade in the form of data sharing. In 2018, 50% of articles did not share their primary data, and where the data was shared, it was in proprietary forms (.docx, .xlsx) or those that do not easily facilitate data reuse (.pdf) (Figure 3).
Chart showing the location of archaeobotanical data from 2009–2018 in primary archaeobotanical data publications.
Just one of the articles included in this review incorporated a dataset archived in a repository (Farahani 2018), in contrast to the substantial growth in data repositories across academic disciplines (Marcial & Hemminger 2010). Other examples provide the underlying data for monograph publications, such as that of the archaeobotanical data from Gordion, Turkey (Marston 2017a, 2017b), Silchester, UK (Lodwick 2018; University of Reading 2018) and Vaihingen, Germany (Bogaard 2011a; Bogaard, 2011b).
Several of the journals that have been assessed have research data policies. In the case of Vegetation History and Archaeobotany, sufficient papers have been surveyed to assess the impact of the research data policy on the availability of data. Figure 4 show the proportion of data sharing formats through time just for VHA (note the small sample size). The introduction of a research data policy in 2016 encouraging data sharing in repositories has not resulted in any datasets being shared in that format. Of the 10 articles published in PLOS One after the introduction of a clear research data policy in 2014, 4 did not contain primary data. However, elsewhere, journals with no research data policy, such as Antiquity, has one of the lower levels of data sharing (Figure 1).
Chart showing the location of primary archaeobotanical data in Vegetation History and Archaeobotany.
There are various reasons for why a primary dataset may be lacking. The option of providing supplementary datasets has been available in many of the journals here since before the start of the surveyed period (e.g. Vegetation History and Archaeobotany in 2004), and so cannot be a reason for the absence of data publication in this journal while it may be a reason in other journals. Reasons suggested for a lack of data sharing within archaeology include technological limitations, and resistance amongst some archaeologists to making their data available due to cautions of exposing data to scrutiny, lost opportunities of analysis before others use it and loss of ‘capital’ of data (Moore & Richards 2015: 34–35). Furthermore, control over how data tables is presented (taxa ordering, summary data presented) may also contribute to the preferential publishing of data within journal articles. Another factor to consider is the emphasis on the creation of new data through archaeological research (Huvila 2016). The creation of a new archaeobotanical dataset through primary analysis is a key form of training in archaeobotany, and the perception of the value of the reuse of other previously published archaeobotanical journals may be low, hence not encouraging the sharing of well-documented datasets. Excellent exams of data reuse have resulted in influential studies (Bogaard 2004; Riehl 2008; Wallace et al. 2019), and would hopefully encourage further data sharing in the future.
Given that there are numerous examples of meta-analysis which do take place in archaeobotany, it seems likely that the prevalent form of data sharing is through informal data sharing between individual specialists. However, this does not improve access to data in the long term, and is inefficient and time consuming, with large potential for data errors (Kansa & Kansa 2013), and relies on personal networks, which are likely to exclude some researchers. The absence of primary data in many archaeobotanical publications thus inhibits the verification of patterns observed within a dataset, and strongly limits the re-use potential of a dataset.
4.2. Data citation
One of the common arguments for increasing data sharing is an associated increase in the citation of the articles which have data available. Here, the data citation practices of meta-analyses of plant macrofossil data undertaken over the last decade have been reviewed. 20 journals were consulted, including a wider range of period-specific journals, and 107 articles were assessed (Lodwick 2019 Table 2). Data citation was assessed as ‘in text’ or ‘in table’ to refer to when the citation and the bibliographic reference were within the article, as ‘in supplementary data’ when the citation and reference were within the supplementary materials, and as ‘no citation’ when no citation and reference was provided.
21% of articles (n = 22) did not contain any citations to the underlying studies. 16% (n = 17) contained citations within supplementary data files. 50% of articles (n = 53) contained a citation within a table within the main article, and 14% (n = 15) contained citations within the main text. For the 21% of articles without data citations, the results of these studies could not be reproduced without consulting individual authors. The papers supplying the underlying data also received no credit for producing these datasets. Where articles contain citations within the main article (in text or table), full credit is provided to the underlying studies, a citation link is created through systems such as google scholar, and the study can be easily built upon in the future. Where the citation is provided within supplementary data, the original studies do receive attribution, but are not linked to so easily.
Through time, there is a steady decrease in the proportion of studies without citations to the underlying data, whereby of the 17 meta-analysis articles published in 2018, only one had no data citations. In comparison, in 2009, 3 out of 8 meta-analysis articles contained no data citation (Figure 6). Overall this is a more positive outlook on the reuse of published data, but the consistent presence of articles lacking data citation indicates that improvements are needed. Reasons for a lack of data citation may include restrictions on word counts imposed by journals, a lack of technical knowledge in making large databases available, or the wish to hold on to a dataset to optimise usage. Considering the type of journal (Figure 5), levels of data citation are worse in general archaeology journals, with sub-disciplinary journals showing slightly better levels of data citation. In particular VHA has a lack of consistency in where data citations are located.

4.3. Reuse of archived archaeobotanical datasets
The majority of data citations assessed in the previous section are to articles or book chapters rather than data-sets. The ADS currently hosts 66 data archives which have been tagged as containing plant macro data, deriving mainly from developer-funded excavations but also some research excavations. However, in some of these the plant macro data is contained within a pdf. As, the archiving of archaeobotanical datasets in data repositories is still at an early stage, the reuse of these datasets is assessed here on a case-by-case basis. The archaeobotanical dataset from the Neolithic site of Vaihingen, Germany (Bogaard 2011b) has not been cited on google scholar. Metrics are provided through the ADS, showing this dataset has been downloaded 56 times with 477 individual visits (as of 25/2/19). The archaeobotanical dataset from Gordion by Marston has no citations on Google Scholar (Marston 2017b), neither does the Giza botanical database (Malleson & Miracle 2018), but these are both very recently archived datasets. In contrast, the Roman Rural Settlement Project dataset, which includes site-level archaeobotanical data, has received greater levels of use, with 12 citations in Google Scholar, over 40,000 file downloads, and over 35,000 visits (Allen et al. 2018) and the archaeobotanical computer database (Tomlinson & Hall 1996) has been cited 44 times, and is the major dataset underpinning other highly-cited studies (Van der Veen, Livarda & Hill 2008; Van der Veen, Hill & Livarda 2013). Whilst there is clearly precedence for the reuse of archaeobotanical databases, current data citation practices within archaeobotany do not yet appear to be formally citing individual datasets, meaning an assessment of the reuse of archived archaeobotanical datasets is challenging.
5. Steps Forward
This review of data sharing, citation, and reuse practices in archaeobotany has found medium levels of data sharing, good levels of data citation, but so far limited levels of reuse of archived data sets. This picture is similar across archaeology, in part attributed to the status of archaeology as a small-science, where data-sharing takes place ad-hoc (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018). Here, recommendations are discussed for improving these data practices within archaeobotany, of applicability more widely in archaeology.
Clearly an important step is improving the sharing of plant macrofossil data. Given the reasonable small size of most archaeobotanical datasets (a .csv file < 1mb), and a lack of ethical conflicts, there seems to be few reasons why the majority of archaeobotanical data couldn’t be shared. In the case of developer-funded derived data, issues of commercial confidentiality could limit the sharing of data. A key stage is establishing why levels of data sharing are not higher. Issues within archaeobotany may include the conflict between having to publish results within excavation monographs, which may take some time to be published, and have limited visibility due to high purchase costs and no digital access, and the need to publish journal articles for career progression within academia. The production of an archaeobotanical dataset is very time-consuming, and interim publication on notable aspects of an assemblage may be considered as a necessary publication strategy. More broadly, one important aspect is issues of equity in access to digital archiving resources (Wright & Richards 2018), such as differential access to funds, training and knowledge. A recent study in Sweden found that we need to know concerns, needs, and wishes of archaeologists in order to improve preservation of archaeological data (Huvila 2016), especially when control of ones data may be linked to perceptions of job security. In order to make improvements in data sharing and reuse across archaeology, we need improved training in data sharing and the reuse of data in higher education (Touchon & McCoy 2016; Cook et al. 2018), improved training in data management (Faniel et al. 2018), and crucially, the necessary software skills to make the reuse of archived datasets attainable (Kansa & Kansa 2014: 91). Examples of good practice in archaeobotany are the Vaihingen and Gordion datasets which demonstrate how datasets can be archived in data repositories to accompany a monograph (Bogaard 2011b; Marston 2017b), whilst Farahani (2018) provides an excellent example of a journal article, where the primary data is supplied as a .csv in a cited data repository along with the R script for the analysis.
In tandem with the need to encourage authors to share their data, is the need for journals to create and implement research data policies. Given the existence of research data policies in many of the journals included here, this reflects other findings of the poor enforcement of data policies by journals (Marwick & Pilaar Birch 2018), supporting arguments that journals should not be relied upon to make data accessible, and data should instead by deposited in digital repositries. In order to implement change in data sharing, there is a role to play for learned societies and academic organisation in lobbying funding bodies, prioritising data sharing in research projects. A key step is through journal editorial boards, and the enforcement of any pre-existing research data policies (Nosek et al. 2015).

The practices of data sharing, data citation and data reuse are all crucial aspects of the reproducibility of archaeological research. This article builds on the small number of studies reviewing data sharing and citation practices in archaeology, focussing on the data-rich sub-discipline of archaeobotanical research. It reviews the form of data shared and the method ofData sharing in 239 articles across 16 journals which present primary plant macrofossil studies. It assesses data-citation in meta-analysis studies in 107 articles across 20 journals. Finally, it explores how these research practices can be improved to benefit the rigour and reuse of archaeo-plant research. The focus of evaluation has been on the uptake of large-scale digital archives for the preservation and dissemination of digital data, such as the Archaeology Data Service (ADS), utilised by developer-led and research projects. The article was published in Open Quaternary, 5(1), p.7. This paper assesses data sharing and reuse practices in archaeology through the case study of archaeobotany. Archaeobotanical data is considered as the quantitative assessment of plant macrofossils present within a sample from a discrete archaeological context. The key issues of data sharing have been touched upon over the past decade within broader discussions on data quality. This article provides the first quantitative assessment. of 1) data publication in recent archaeobotsanical journal articles 2) data citation in recent. archaeobOTanical meta-analysis and 3) the reuse of Archaeobotsan datasets. The aim of the paper is to assess whether practices need to change and how such changes can take place. The authors conclude that, currently, we have no evidence for the levels of data share and reuse within archaeobbotany. They conclude that the current data sharing practices within the sub-discipline do not appear to be working well enough to warrant further study. The paper is the first of its kind and is published in the online edition of the Journal of Archaeological Research (JAR). From the earliest archaeobotanical reports, such as Reid’s work at Roman Silchester, the sample from which plant remains were recovered was noted. The creation of sample-level data means analysis is often undertaken on the basis of individual samples, for instance the assessment of crop-processing stages and weed ecological evidence for crop husbandry practices. The analysis of sample level data also enables archaeobotsanical finds to be integrated alongside contextual evidence from archaeological sites. Requirements for the publication of this data are in place in some archaeological guidelines, for example current Historic England guidelines for archaeological practice in England. The availability of data from post-excavation assessment reports has remained challenging. So-called ‘grey literature’ results from the initial evaluation stage of developer-funded investigations often contain a semi-quantitative evaluation of archaeobOTanical samples on a scale of abundance. The data is available to download as a.csv file. However, academic journals are typically perceived as the most high-status publication venue for archaeological data, in order to comply with institutional requirements. Recent important advances within archaeobotanical data sharing have focussed on the construction of the ARBODAT database. Data sharing enabled by this database has facilitated research on Neolithic agriculture in Austria, Bulgaria and Germany. The use of this database makes data integration between specialists easier due to the shared data structure and metadata description. There has been a long-standing concern with the need to aggregate datasets and identify temporal and spatial patterns. The International Work Group for Palaeoethnobotany was itself founded in 1968 in part with the aim to compile archaeobotsanical data. It is vital that we know whether the mass of new data being produced is made available and is being reused. The extent of these problems is currently unknown, and it is important to know how much data is being made available to the public and how it is being used in subsequent research. The Archaeobotany Computer Database (ABCD), published in 1996 in the first issue of Internet Archaeology, contained much of the archaeoboology that is now being published. The majority of databases have a restricted regional coverage, whilst research-project driven period-specific databases provide overlapping content. Data which is most commonly available are bibliographic references per site, with some indications of mode of preservation, quantity of archaeobotanical data, and sometimes taxa present. Meta-analysis is often used to identify spatial and chronological trends in a range of past human activities, for instance crop choice, crop husbandry practices, plant food consumption, the trade in luxury foods or the use of plants in ritual. Open Data is one of the three core principles for promoting transparency in social science (Miguel et al. 2014). The FAIR principles, developed by representatives from academia, have been summarised within principles of open science, as recently set out in relation to archaeology. The IWGP website curates a list of resources, but otherwise the resources are often disseminated through the Archaeobotany jiscmail list. For instance, sample-level data is required for meta-studies to identify high-quality samples of unmixed crops for weed ecology analysis. FAIR principles provide four principles which data sharing should meet for use by both humans and machines – Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (Wilkinson et al. 2016). A recent report assessing the adoption and impact of FAIR principles across academia in the UK included archaeology as a case study. Increasingly, archaeological data is made available through a wide range of data repositories (OSF, Mendeley Data, Zenodo, Open Context) Levels of data reuse in archaeology are thought to remain low (Huggett 2018) Principles for responsible data citation have recently been developed summarising how datasets should be cited. The review of academic journals provided a contrast to recent assessments of archaeobotanical data deriving from developer-funded archaeology (Lodwick 2017c; Van der Veen, Hill & Livarda 2013). Journal articles have been selected as the focus of this study as the provision of online supplementary materials in the majority of journals should not limit the publication of data and references. The location of primary archaeobotanical data, that is sample level counts of macroscopic plant remains, was assessed for 239 journal articles across 16 journals. Overall, only 56% of articles shared their primary data. The sharing of primary data within an article remains the most common data sharing form. The data which was available ranged from summary statistics, typically counts or frequencies, reported either by site, site phase, or feature group. Supplementary datasets are the third most common form of data sharing. Data tables in text require manual handling to extract data, in journals such as VHA, whilst in other journals in-text tables can be downloaded as.csv files. Data cannot be reused for crop-processing or weed ecology analysis which requires sample level data. This data would have been collected on a sample-by-sample basis, but this information is lost from the resulting publication. The extent of data reuse ranges from the analysis of whole sample data to the presence/absence of individual crops. The underlying dataset for the analysis is available in Lodwick 2019. There is no data sharing policy in most journals. The most common form of data sharing is in the form of.xlsx. The lack of sharing may be due to the lack of a policy to share data. It may also be because of a lack of interest in sharing data with others. It could also be a result of lack of awareness of the need for data sharing in the first place. It is hoped that this will lead to the creation of more data-sharing policies in the future.

The article is based on an earlier version of this article that incorrectly stated that the author was the author of the article. The author has been asked to clarify that the article was written by the editor of the journal. 21% of articles (n = 22) did not contain any citations to the underlying studies.

What are some fields in which the inverse problem is encountered?,"\section{Introduction}
Given a data set and a model with some unknown parameters, the inverse problem aims to find the values of the model parameters that best fit the data.  
In this work, in which we focus on systems of interacting elements,
 the inverse problem concerns  the statistical inference
 of the underling interaction network and of its coupling coefficients from observed data on the dynamics  of the system. 
 Versions of this problem are encountered in physics, biology (e.g., \cite{Balakrishnan11,Ekeberg13,Christoph14}), social sciences and finance (e.g.,\cite{Mastromatteo12,yamanaka_15}), neuroscience (e.g., \cite{Schneidman06,Roudi09a,tyrcha_13}), just to cite a few, and are becoming more and more important due to the increase in the amount of data available from these fields.\\
 \indent 
 A standard approach used in statistical inference is to predict the interaction couplings by maximizing the likelihood function.
 This technique, however, requires the evaluation of the  
 
   partition function that, in the most general case, concerns a number of computations scaling exponentially with the system size.
  
  
    Boltzmann machine learning uses Monte Carlo sampling to compute the gradients of the Log-likelihood looking for stationary points \cite{Murphy12} but this method is computationally manageable only for small systems. A series of faster approximations, such as naive mean-field, independent-pair approximation \cite{Roudi09a, Roudi09b}, inversion of TAP equations \cite{Kappen98,Tanaka98}, small correlations expansion \cite{Sessak09}, adaptive TAP \cite{Opper01}, adaptive  cluster expansion \cite{Cocco12} or Bethe approximations \cite{Ricci-Tersenghi12, Nguyen12}  have, then, been developed. These techniques take as input means and correlations of observed variables and most of them assume a fully connected graph as underlying connectivity network, or expand  around it by perturbative dilution.  In most cases, network reconstruction turns out to  be not accurate for small data sizes and/or when couplings are  strong or, else, if the original interaction network is sparse.\\
\indent
 A further method, substantially improving performances for small data, is the so-called Pseudo-Likelyhood Method (PLM) \cite{Ravikumar10}. In Ref. \cite{Aurell12} Aurell and Ekeberg performed a comparison between PLM and some of the just mentioned mean-field-based algorithms on the pairwise interacting Ising-spin  ($\sigma = \pm 1$) model, showing how PLM performs sensitively better, especially on sparse graphs and in the high-coupling limit, i.e., for low temperature.
 
 In this work, we aim at performing statistical inference  on a model whose interacting variables are continuous $XY$ spins, i.e., $\sigma \equiv \left(\cos \phi,\sin \phi\right)$ with $\phi \in [0, 2\pi )$. The developed tools can, actually, be also straightforward applied  to the $p$-clock model  \cite{Potts52} where the phase $\phi$ takes discretely equispaced $p$ values  in the $2 \pi$ interval, $\phi_a =  a 2 \pi/p$, with $a= 0,1,\dots,p-1$. The $p$-clock model, else called vector Potts model, gives a hierarchy of discretization of the $XY$ model as $p$ increases. For $p=2$, one recovers the Ising model, for $p=4$ the Ashkin-Teller model \cite{Ashkin43}, for $p=6$ the ice-type model \cite{Pauling35,Baxter82} and the eight-vertex model \cite{Sutherland70,Fan70,Baxter71} for $p=8$.  
It turns out to be very useful also for numerical implementations of the continuous $XY$ model. 
Recent analysis on the multi-body $XY$ model has shown that for a limited number of discrete phase values ($p\sim 16, 32$) the thermodynamic critical properties of the $p\to\infty$ $XY$ limit are promptly recovered \cite{Marruzzo15, Marruzzo16}.  
Our main motivation to study statistical inference is that these kind of models have recently turned out to be rather useful in describing the behavior of optical systems, 
including standard mode-locking lasers \cite{Gordon02,Gat04,Angelani07,Marruzzo15} and random lasers \cite{Angelani06a,Leuzzi09a,Antenucci15a,Antenucci15b,Marruzzo16}. 
In particular, the inverse problem on the pairwise XY model analyzed here might be of help in recovering images from light propagated through random media. 


      This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. \ref{sec:model} we introduce the general model  and we discuss its  derivation also  as a model for light transmission through random scattering media. 
    In Sec. \ref{sec:plm} we introduce the PLM with $l_2$ regularization  and with decimation, two variants of the PLM respectively introduced in Ref. \cite{Wainwright06} and \cite{Aurell12} for the inverse Ising problem. 
    Here, we analyze these techniques for continuous $XY$ spins and we test them on thermalized data generated by Exchange Monte Carlo numerical simulations of the original model dynamics. In Sec. \ref{sec:res_reg} we  present the results related to the PLM-$l_2$. In Sec. \ref{sec:res_dec} the results related to the PLM with decimation are reported and its performances are compared to the PLM-$l_2$ and to a variational mean-field method analyzed in Ref. \cite{Tyagi15}. In Sec. \ref{sec:conc}, we outline conclusive remarks and perspectives.

        \section{The leading $XY$ model}
      \label{sec:model}
 The leading model we are considering is defined, for a system of $N$ angular $XY$ variables, by the Hamiltonian 
 \begin{equation}
  \mathcal{H} = - \sum_{ik}^{1,N} J_{ik} \cos{\left(\phi_i-\phi_k\right)} 
  \label{eq:HXY}
 
  \end{equation} 
  
  The $XY$ model is well known in statistical mechanics, displaying important physical
  insights, starting from the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
  transition in two dimensions\cite{Berezinskii70,Berezinskii71,Kosterlitz72} and moving to, e.g., the
  transition of liquid helium to its superfluid state \cite{Brezin82}, the roughening transition of the interface of a crystal in equilibrium with its vapor \cite{Cardy96}. In presence of disorder and frustration \cite{Villain77,Fradkin78} the model has been adopted to describe synchronization problems as the Kuramoto model \cite{Kuramoto75} and in the theoretical modeling of Josephson junction arrays \cite{Teitel83a,Teitel83b} and arrays of coupled lasers \cite{Nixon13}.
  Besides several derivations and implementations of the model in quantum and classical physics, equilibrium or out of equilibrium, ordered or fully frustrated systems, Eq. (\ref{eq:HXY}), in its generic form,
  has found applications also in other fields. A rather fascinating example being the behavior of starlings flocks  \cite{Reynolds87,Deneubourg89,Huth90,Vicsek95, Cavagna13}.
  Our interest on the $XY$ model resides, though, in optics. Phasor and phase models with pairwise and  multi-body interaction terms can, indeed, describe the behavior of electromagnetic modes in both linear and nonlinear optical systems in the analysis of problems such as light propagation and lasing \cite{Gordon02, Antenucci15c, Antenucci15d}. As couplings are strongly frustrated, these models turn out to be especially useful to the study of optical properties in random media \cite{Antenucci15a,Antenucci15b}, as in the noticeable case of random lasers \cite{Wiersma08,Andreasen11,Antenucci15e}  and they might as well be applied to linear scattering problems, e.g., propagation of waves in opaque systems or disordered fibers. 
  
  
  \subsection{A propagating wave model}
  We briefly mention a derivation of the model as a proxy for the propagation of light through random linear media. 
 Scattering of light is held responsible to obstruct our view and make objects opaque. Light rays, once that they enter the material, only exit  after getting scattered multiple times within the material. In such a disordered medium, both the direction and the phase of the propagating waves are random. Transmitted light 
 yields a disordered interference pattern typically  having low intensity, random phase and almost no resolution, called a speckle. Nevertheless, in recent years it has been realized that disorder is rather a blessing in disguise \cite{Vellekoop07,Vellekoop08a,Vellekoop08b}. Several experiments have made it possible to control the behavior of light and other optical processes in a given random disordered medium,  
 by exploiting, e.g.,  the tools developed for wavefront shaping to control the propagation of light and to engineer the confinement of light \cite{Yilmaz13,Riboli14}.
 \\
 \indent
 In a linear dielectric medium, light propagation can be described through a part of the scattering matrix, the transmission matrix $\mathbb{T}$, linking the outgoing to the incoming fields. 
 Consider the case in which there are $N_I$ incoming channels and $N_O$ outgoing ones; we can indicate with $E^{\rm in,out}_k$ the input/output electromagnetic field phasors of channel $k$. In the most general case, i.e., without making any particular assumptions on the field polarizations, each light mode and its polarization polarization state can be represented by means of the $4$-dimensional Stokes vector. Each $ t_{ki}$ element of $\mathbb{T}$, thus, is a $4 \times 4$ M{\""u}ller matrix. If, on the other hand, we know that the source is polarized and the observation is made on the same polarization, one can use a scalar model and adopt Jones calculus \cite{Goodman85,Popoff10a,Akbulut11}:
   \begin{eqnarray}
 E^{\rm out}_k = \sum_{i=1}^{N_I}  t_{ki} E^{\rm in}_i \qquad \forall~ k=1,\ldots,N_O
 \label{eq:transm}
 \end{eqnarray}
  We recall that the elements of the transmission matrix are random complex coefficients\cite{Popoff10a}. For the case of completely unpolarized modes, we can also use a scalar model similar to Eq. \eqref{eq:transm}, but whose variables are  the intensities of the outgoing/incoming fields, rather than the fields themselves.\\ 
In the following, for simplicity, we will consider Eq. (\ref{eq:transm}) as our starting point,
where $E^{\rm out}_k$, $E^{\rm in}_i$ and $t_{ki}$ are all complex scalars. 
If Eq. \eqref{eq:transm} holds for any $k$, we can write:
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \int \prod_{k=1}^{N_O} dE^{\rm out}_k \prod_{k=1}^{N_O}\delta\left(E^{\rm out}_k - \sum_{j=1}^{N_I}  t_{kj} E^{\rm in}_j \right) = 1
  \nonumber
  \\
  \label{eq:deltas}
  \end{eqnarray}

 Observed data are a noisy representation of the true values of the fields. Therefore, in inference problems it is statistically more meaningful to take that noise into account in a probabilistic way, 
 rather than looking  at the precise solutions of the exact equations (whose parameters are unknown). 
 To this aim we can introduce Gaussian distributions whose limit for zero variance are the Dirac deltas in Eq. (\ref{eq:deltas}).
 Moreover, we move to consider the ensemble of all possible solutions of Eq. (\ref{eq:transm}) at given $\mathbb{T}$, looking at  all configurations of input fields. We, thus, define the function:
 
   \begin{eqnarray}
  Z &\equiv &\int_{{\cal S}_{\rm in}} \prod_{j=1}^{N_I}  dE^{\rm in}_j \int_{{\cal S}_{\rm out}}\prod_{k=1}^{N_O} dE^{\rm out}_k 
  \label{def:Z}
\\
    \times
  &&\prod_{k=1}^{N_O}
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \Delta^2}}  \exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2 \Delta^2}\left|
  E^{\rm out}_k -\sum_{j=1}^{N_I}  t_{kj} E^{\rm in}_j\right|^2
\right\} 
\nonumber
 \end{eqnarray}
   We stress that the integral of Eq. \eqref{def:Z} is not exactly a Gaussian integral. Indeed, starting from Eq. \eqref{eq:deltas}, two constraints on the electromagnetic field intensities must be taken into account. 

  The space of solutions is  delimited by the total power ${\cal P}$ received by system, i.e., 
  ${\cal S}_{\rm in}: \{E^{\rm in} |\sum_k I^{\rm in}_k = \mathcal{P}\}$, also implying  a constraint on the total amount of energy that is transmitted through the medium, i. e., 
  ${\cal S}_{\rm out}:\{E^{\rm out} |\sum_k I^{\rm out}_k=c\mathcal{P}\}$, where the attenuation factor  $c<1$ accounts for total losses.
  As we will see more in details in the following, being interested in inferring the transmission matrix through the PLM, we can omit to explicitly include these terms in Eq. \eqref{eq:H_J} since they do not depend on $\mathbb{T}$ not adding any information on the gradients with respect to the elements of $\mathbb{T}$.
  
 Taking the same number of incoming and outcoming channels, $N_I=N_O=N/2$, and  ordering the input fields in the first $N/2$ mode indices and the output fields in the last $N/2$ indices, we can drop the ``in'' and ``out'' superscripts and formally write $Z$  as a partition function
    \begin{eqnarray}
        \label{eq:z}
 && Z =\int_{\mathcal S} \prod_{j=1}^{N} dE_j \left(   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \Delta^2}} \right)^{N/2} 
 \hspace*{-.4cm} \exp\left\{
  -\frac{ {\cal H} [\{E\};\mathbb{T}] }{2\Delta^2}
  \right\}
  \\
&&{\cal H} [\{E\};\mathbb{T}] =
-  \sum_{k=1}^{N/2}\sum_{j=N/2+1}^{N} \left[E^*_j t_{jk} E_k + E_j t^*_{kj} E_k^* 
\right]
 \nonumber
\\
&&\qquad\qquad \qquad + \sum_{j=N/2+1}^{N} |E_j|^2+ \sum_{k,l}^{1,N/2}E_k
U_{kl} E_l^*
 \nonumber
 \\
 \label{eq:H_J}
 &&\hspace*{1.88cm } = - \sum_{nm}^{1,N} E_n J_{nm} E_m^*
 \end{eqnarray}
 where ${\cal H}$ is a real-valued function by construction, we have introduced the effective input-input coupling matrix
\begin{equation}
U_{kl} \equiv \sum_{j=N/2+1}^{N}t^*_{lj} t_{jk} 
 \label{def:U}
 \end{equation}
 and the whole interaction matrix reads (here $\mathbb{T} \equiv \{ t_{jk} \}$)
 \begin{equation}
 \label{def:J}
 \mathbb J\equiv \left(\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}
 \phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}\\
 \phantom{()}&-\mathbb{U} \phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&{\mathbb{T}}&\phantom{()}\\
\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}\\
 \hline
\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}\\
 \phantom{()}& \mathbb   T^\dagger&\phantom{()}&\phantom{()}& - \mathbb{I} &\phantom{()}\\
\phantom{a}&\phantom{a}&\phantom{a}&\phantom{a}&\phantom{a}&\phantom{a}\\
 \end{array}\right)
 \end{equation}
 
 Determining the electromagnetic complex amplitude configurations that minimize the {\em cost function} ${\cal H}$, Eq.  (\ref{eq:H_J}),  means to maximize the overall distribution peaked around the solutions of the transmission Eqs. (\ref{eq:transm}). As the variance $\Delta^2\to 0$, eventually, the initial set of Eqs. (\ref{eq:transm}) are recovered. The ${\cal H}$ function, thus, plays the role of an Hamiltonian and  $\Delta^2$ the role of a noise-inducing temperature. The exact numerical problem corresponds to the zero temperature limit of the statistical mechanical problem. Working with real data, though, which are noisy, a finite ``temperature''
  allows for a better representation of the ensemble of solutions to the sets of equations of continuous variables. 
  

  
  
  Now, we can express every phasor in Eq. \eqref{eq:z}  as $E_k = A_k e^{\imath \phi_k}$. As a working hypothesis we will consider the intensities $A_k^2$ as either homogeneous or as \textit{quenched} with respect to phases.
The first condition occurs, for instance, to the input intensities $|E^{\rm in}_k|$ produced by a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) with homogeneous illumination \cite{Popoff11}.
With \textit{quenched} here we mean, instead, that the intensity of each mode is the same for every solution of Eq. \eqref{eq:transm} at fixed $\mathbb T$.
We stress that, including intensities in the model does not preclude the inference analysis but it is out of the focus of the present work and will be considered elsewhere. 

If all intensities are uniform in input and in output, this amount to a constant rescaling for each one of the four sectors of matrix $\mathbb J$ in Eq. (\ref{def:J}) that will not change the properties of the matrices.
For instance, if the original transmission matrix is unitary, so it will be the rescaled one and the matrix $\mathbb U$ will be  diagonal.
Otherwise, if intensities are \textit{quenched}, i.e., they can be considered as constants in Eq. (\ref{eq:transm}),
they are inhomogeneous with respect to phases. The generic Hamiltonian element will, therefore, rescale as 
  \begin{eqnarray}
  E^*_n J_{nm} E_m = J_{nm} A_n A_m e^{\imath (\phi_n-\phi_m)} \to J_{nm} e^{\imath (\phi_n-\phi_m)}
  \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}
  and the properties of the original  $J_{nm}$ components are not conserved  in the rescaled one. In particular, we have no argument, anymore, to possibly set the rescaled $U_{nm}\propto \delta_{nm}$.
  Eventually, we end up with the complex couplings $XY$ model, whose real-valued Hamiltonian is written as
 \begin{eqnarray}
  \mathcal{H}& = &  - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{nm} J_{nm} e^{-\imath (\phi_n - \phi_m)}  + \mbox{c.c.} 
    \label{eq:h_im}
\\    &=&  - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{nm} \left[J^R_{nm} \cos(\phi_n - \phi_m)+
  J^I_{nm}\sin (\phi_n - \phi_m)\right] 
  \nonumber
 \end{eqnarray}
where $J_{nm}^R$ and $J_{nm}^I$ are the real and imaginary parts of $J_{nm}$. Being $\mathbb J$  Hermitian, $J^R_{nm}=J^R_{mn}$ is symmetric and $J_{nm}^I=-J_{mn}^I$ is skew-symmetric.

\begin{comment}
\textcolor{red}{
F: comment about quenched:
I think that to obtain the XY model, it is not necessary that the intensities are strictly quenched (that is also a quite unfeasible situation, I guess).
Indeed eq (2) does not deal with the dynamics of the modes, but just connect the in and out ones.
For this, what it is necessary to have the XY model, it is that the intensities are always the same on the different samples
(so that the matrix $t_{ij}$ is the same for different phase data). If the intensities are fixed, then they can be incorporated in $t_{ij}$ and eq (2) can be written just for phases as described. \\

  \section{Pseudolikelihood Maximization}
  \label{sec:plm}
The inverse problem consists in the reconstruction of the parameters $J_{nm}$ of the Hamiltonian, Eq. (\ref{eq:h_im}).  
Given a set of $M$ data configurations of $N$ spins
 $\bm\sigma = \{ \cos \phi_i^{(\mu)},\sin \phi_i^{(\mu)} \}$, $i = 1,\dots,N$ and $\mu=1,\dots,M$, we want to \emph{infer} the couplings:
 \begin{eqnarray}
\bm \sigma  \rightarrow  \mathbb{J} 
\nonumber
 \end{eqnarray}
 With this purpose in mind,
 in the rest of this section we implement the working equations for the techniques used. 
 In order to test our methods, we generate the input data, i.e., the configurations, by Monte-Carlo simulations of the model.
 The joint probability distribution of the $N$ variables $\bm{\phi}\equiv\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_N\}$, follows the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution:
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:p_xy}
 P(\bm{\phi}) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\beta \mathcal{H\left(\bm{\phi}\right)}} \quad \mbox{ where } \quad Z = \int \prod_{k=1}^N d\phi_k  e^{-\beta \mathcal{H\left(\bm{\phi}\right)}}  
 \end{equation}
 and where we denote $\beta=\left( 2\Delta^2 \right)^{-1}$ with respect to Eq. (\ref{def:Z}) formalism.
 In order to stick to usual statistical inference notation, in the following we will rescale the couplings by a factor $\beta / 2$: $\beta J_{ij}/2 \rightarrow J_{ij}$. 
 The main idea of the PLM is to work with the conditional probability distribution of one variable $\phi_i$ given all other variables, 
 $\bm{\phi}_{\backslash i}$:
 
  \begin{eqnarray}
	\nonumber
   P(\phi_i | \bm{\phi}_{\backslash i}) &=& \frac{1}{Z_i} \exp \left \{ {H_i^x (\bm{\phi}_{\backslash i})
  	\cos \phi_i + H_i^y (\bm{\phi}_{\backslash i}) \sin \phi_i } \right \}
	\\
 \label{eq:marginal_xy}
	&=&\frac{e^{H_i(\bm{\phi}_{\backslash i}) \cos{\left(\phi_i-\alpha_i(\bm{\phi}_{\backslash i})\right)}}}{2 \pi I_0(H_i)}
  \end{eqnarray}
  where $H_i^x$ and $H_i^y$ are defined as
   \begin{eqnarray}
   H_i^x (\bm{\phi}_{\backslash i})  &=& \sum_{j (\neq i)} J^R_{ij} \cos \phi_j  - \sum_{j  (\neq i) } J_{ij}^{I} \sin \phi_j \phantom{+  h^R_i} \label{eq:26} \\
   H_i^y  (\bm{\phi}_{\backslash i})  &=&  \sum_{j  (\neq i)} J^R_{ij}  \sin \phi_j  + \sum_{j  (\neq i) } J_{ij}^{I}   \cos \phi_j \phantom{ + h_i^{I} }\label{eq:27}
   \end{eqnarray}
and $H_i= \sqrt{(H_i^x)^2 + (H_i^y)^2}$, $\alpha_i = \arctan H_i^y/H_i^x$   and we introduced the modified Bessel function of the first kind:
  \begin{equation}
  \nonumber
   I_k(x) = \frac{1}{2 \pi}\int_{0}^{2 \pi} d \phi e^{x \cos{ \phi}}\cos{k \phi}
  \end{equation}
  
   Given $M$ observation samples $\bm{\phi}^{(\mu)}=\{\phi^\mu_1,\ldots,\phi^\mu_N\}$, $\mu = 1,\dots, M$, the
   pseudo-loglikelihood for the variable $i$ is given by the logarithm of Eq. (\ref{eq:marginal_xy}),
   \begin{eqnarray}
   \label{eq:L_i}
   L_i &=& \frac{1}{M}  \sum_{\mu = 1}^M  \ln P(\phi_i^{(\mu)}|\bm{\phi}^{(\mu)}_{\backslash i})
   \\
   \nonumber
   & =&  \frac{1}{M}  \sum_{\mu = 1}^M  \left[ H_i^{(\mu)} \cos( \phi_i^{(\mu)} - \alpha_i^{(\mu)}) - \ln  2 \pi I_0\left(H_i^{(\mu)}\right)\right] \, .
    \end{eqnarray}
The underlying idea of PLM is that an approximation of the true parameters of the model is obtained for values that maximize the functions $L_i$.
The specific maximization scheme differentiates the different techniques.


   
   
   \subsection{PLM with $l_2$ regularization}
   Especially for the case of sparse graphs, it is useful to add a regularizer, which prevents the maximization routine to move towards high values of 
   $J_{ij}$ and $h_i$ without converging. We will adopt an $l_2$ regularization so that the Pseudolikelihood function (PLF) at site $i$  reads:
   \begin{equation}\label{eq:plf_i}
  {\cal L}_i = L_i
  - \lambda \sum_{i \neq j} \left(J_{ij}^R\right)^2 - \lambda \sum_{i \neq j} \left(J_{ij}^I\right)^2  
   \end{equation}
   with $\lambda>0$.
   Note that the values of $\lambda$ have to be chosen arbitrarily, but not too large, in order not to overcome $L_i$.
   The standard implementation of the PLM consists in maximizing each ${\cal L}_i$, for $i=1\dots N$, separately. The expected values of the couplings are then:
   \begin{equation}
   \{ J_{i j}^*\}_{j\in \partial i} :=  \mbox{arg max}_{ \{ J_{ij} \}}
    \left[{\cal L}_i\right]
   \end{equation}
   In this way, we obtain two estimates for the coupling $J_{ij}$, one from maximization of ${\cal L}_i$, $J_{ij}^{(i)}$, and another one from ${\cal L}_j$, say $J_{ij}^{(j)}$.
    Since the original Hamiltonian of the $XY$ model is Hermitian, we know that the real part of the couplings is symmetric while the imaginary part is skew-symmetric. 
   
     The final estimate for $J_{ij}$ can then be obtained  averaging the two results:
  
  
  
   \begin{equation}\label{eq:symm}
   J_{ij}^{\rm inferred} = \frac{J_{ij}^{(i)} + \bar{J}_{ij}^{(j)}}{2} 
   \end{equation}
   where with $\bar{J}$ we indicate the complex conjugate.
   It is worth noting that the pseudolikelihood $L_i$, Eq. \eqref{eq:L_i}, is characterized by the
   following properties: (i) the normalization term of Eq.\eqref{eq:marginal_xy} can be
   computed analytically at odd with the {\em full} likelihood case that
   in general require a computational time which scales exponentially
   with the size of the systems; (ii) the $\ell_2$-regularized pseudolikelihood
   defined in Eq.\eqref{eq:plf_i} is strictly concave (i.e. it has a single
   maximizer)\cite{Ravikumar10}; (iii) it is consistent, i.e. if $M$ samples are
   generated by a model $P(\phi | J*)$ the maximizer tends to $J*$
   for $M\rightarrow\infty$\cite{besag1975}. Note also that (iii) guarantees that  
   $|J^{(i)}_{ij}-J^{(j)}_{ij}| \rightarrow 0$ for $M\rightarrow \infty$.
   In Secs. \ref{sec:res_reg}, \ref{sec:res_dec} 
   we report the results obtained and we analyze the performances of the PLM having taken the configurations from Monte-Carlo simulations of models whose details are known.
   

   
   \subsection{PLM with decimation}
   Even though the PLM with $l_2$-regularization allows to dwell the inference towards the low temperature region and in the low sampling case with better performances that mean-field methods, in some situations some couplings are overestimated and not at all symmetric. Moreover, in the technique there is the bias of the $l_2$ regularizer.
   Trying to overcome these problems, Decelle and Ricci-Tersenghi introduced a new method \cite{Decelle14}, known as PLM + decimation: the algorithm maximizes the sum of the $L_i$,
   \begin{eqnarray}
    {\cal L}\equiv \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \mbox{L}_i
    \end{eqnarray}  
    and, then, it recursively set to zero couplings which are estimated very small. We expect that as long as we are setting to zero couplings that are unnecessary to fit the data, there should be not much changing on ${\cal L}$. Keeping on with decimation, a point is reached where ${\cal L}$ decreases abruptly indicating  that relevant couplings are being decimated and under-fitting is taking place.
   Let us define  by $x$  the fraction of non-decimated couplings. To have a quantitative measure for the halt criterion of the decimation process, a tilted ${\cal L}$ is defined as,
   \begin{eqnarray}
  \mathcal{L}_t &\equiv& \mathcal{L}  - x \mathcal{L}_{\textup{max}} - (1-x) \mathcal{L}_{\textup{min}} \label{$t$PLF} 
   \end{eqnarray}
   where 
   \begin{itemize}
   \item $\mathcal{L}_{\textup{min}}$ is the pseudolikelyhood of a model with independent variables. In the XY case: $\mathcal{L}_{\textup{min}}=-\ln{2 \pi}$.
   \item
   $\mathcal{L}_{\textup{max}}$ is the pseudolikelyhood in the fully-connected model and it is maximized over all the $N(N-1)/2$ possible couplings. 
   \end{itemize}
   At the first step, when $x=1$, $\mathcal{L}$ takes value $\mathcal{L}_{\rm max}$ and  $\mathcal{L}_t=0$. On the last step, for an empty graph, i.e., $x=0$, $\mathcal{L}$ takes the value $\mathcal{L}_{\rm min}$ and, hence, again $\mathcal{L}_t =0$. 
   In the intermediate steps, during the decimation procedure, as $x$ is decreasing from $1$ to $0$, one observes firstly that $\mathcal{L}_t$ increases linearly and, then, it displays an abrupt decrease indicating that from this point on relevant couplings are being decimated\cite{Decelle14}. In Fig. \ref{Jor1-$t$PLF} we give an instance of this behavior for the 2D short-range XY model with ordered couplings. We notice that the maximum point of $\mathcal{L}_t$ coincides with the minimum point of the reconstruction error, the latter defined as 
   \begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:errj}
   \mbox{err}_J \equiv \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i<j} (J^{\rm inferred}_{ij} -J^{\rm true}_{ij})^2}{N(N-1)/2}} \label{err}
   \end{eqnarray}
  We stress that the ${\cal L}_t$ maximum is obtained ignoring the underlying graph, while the err$_J$ minimum can be evaluated once the true graph has been reconstructed. 
   
     \begin{figure}[t!]
   	\centering
   	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Jor1_dec_tPLF_new.eps}
   	\caption{The tilted likelyhood ${\cal L}_t$ curve and the reconstruction error vs the number of decimated couplings  for an ordered, real-valued J on 2D XY model with $N=64$ spins. The peak of ${\cal L}_t$ coincides with the dip of the error.}  
   	\label{Jor1-$t$PLF}
   \end{figure} 
       
   
   In the next sections we will show the results obtained on the  $XY$ model analyzing the performances of the two methods and comparing them also with a mean-field method \cite{Tyagi15}.
   
  
    
   \section{Inferred couplings with PLM-$l_2$}
    \label{sec:res_reg}
    \subsection{$XY$ model with real-valued couplings}
    
    In order to obtain the vector of couplings, $J_{ij}^{\rm inferred}$ the function $-\mathcal{L}_i$ is minimized through the vector of derivatives ${\partial \mathcal{L}_i}/\partial J_{ij}$. The process is repeated for all the couplings obtaining then a fully connected adjacency matrix. The results here presented are obtained with $\lambda = 0.01$.
   For the minimization we have used the MATLAB routine \emph{minFunc\_2012}\cite{min_func}. 
      
      \begin{figure}[t!]
    	\centering
    	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Jor11_2D_l2_JR_soJR_TPJR}
    	\caption{Top panels: instances of single site coupling reconstruction for the case of $N=64$ XY spins on a 2D lattice with ordered $J$ (left column) and bimodal distributed $J$ (right column). 
    	
    	Bottom panels: sorted couplings.}
    	\label{PL-Jor1}
    \end{figure}

   
To produce the data by means of numerical Monte Carlo simulations a system with $N=64$  spin variables  is considered on a deterministic 2D lattice with periodic boundary conditions. 
Each spin has then connectivity $4$, i.e., we expect to infer an adjacency matrix with $N c = 256$ couplings different from zero. 
The dynamics of the simulated model is based on the Metropolis algorithm and parallel tempering\cite{earl05} is used to speed up the thermalization of the system.
The thermalization is tested looking at the average energy over logarithmic time windows and
the acquisition of independent configurations
starts only after the system is well thermalized.

   For the values of the couplings we considered two cases: an ordered case, indicated in the figure as  $J$ ordered (e.g., left column of Fig. \ref{PL-Jor1}) where the couplings can take values $J_{ij}=0,J$, with $J=1$, 
   and a quenched disordered case, indicated in the figures as  $J$ disordered (e.g., right column of Fig. \ref{PL-Jor1})
   where the couplings can take also  negative values, i.e., 
    $J_{ij}=0,J,-J$, with a certain probability.  The results here presented were obtained with bimodal distributed $J$s: 
   
    $P(J_{ij}=J)=P(J_{ij}=-J)=1/2$.  The performances of the PLM have shown not to depend on $P(J)$. 
   
    We recall that in Sec. \ref{sec:plm} we used the temperature-rescaled notation, i.e., $J_{ij}$ stands for $J_{ij}/T$. 
   
    To analyze the performances of the PLM, in Fig. \ref{PL-Jor1} the inferred couplings, $\mathbb{J}^R_{\rm inf}$, are shown on top of the original couplings,  $\mathbb{J}^R_{\rm true}$.
     The first figure (from top) in the left column shows  the $\mathbb{J}^R_{\rm inf}$ (black) and the $\mathbb{J}^R_{\rm tru}$ (green) for a given spin
     at temperature $T/J=0.7$ and number of samples  $M=1024$. PLM appears to reconstruct the correct couplings, though zero couplings are always given a small inferred non-zero value. 
     In the left column of Fig.  \ref{PL-Jor1},  both the $\mathbb{J}^R_{\rm{inf}}$ and the $\mathbb{J}^R_{\rm{tru}}$ are sorted in decreasing order and plotted on top of each other. 
     We can clearly see that $\mathbb{J}^R_{\rm inf}$ reproduces the expected step function. Even though the jump is smeared, the difference between inferred couplings corresponding to the set of non-zero couplings 
     and to the set of zero couplings can be clearly appreciated.
     Similarly, the plots in the right column of Fig. \ref{PL-Jor1} show the results obtained for the case with  bimodal disordered couplings, for the same working temperature and number of samples. 
     In particular, note that the algorithm infers half positive and half negative couplings, as expected.
     
     
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Jor11_2D_l2_errJ_varT_varM}
\caption{Reconstruction error $\mbox{err}_J$, cf. Eq. (\ref{eq:errj}), plotted as a function of temperature (left) for three values of the number of samples $M$ and  as a function $M$ (right) for three values of temperature in the ordered system, i.e., $J_{ij}=0,1$. 
The system size is $N=64$.}
\label{PL-err-Jor1}
\end{figure}

In order to analyze the effects of the number of samples and of the temperature regimes, we plot in Fig. \ref{PL-err-Jor1} the reconstruction error, Eq. (\ref{err}), as a function of temperature for three different sample sizes $M=64,128$ and $512$. 
The error is seen to sharply rise al low temperature, incidentally, in the ordered case, for  $T<T_c \sim 0.893$, which is the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature of the 2XY model\cite{Olsson92}. 
 However, we can see that if only $M=64$ samples are considered, $\mbox{err}_J$ remains high independently on the working temperature. 
 In the right plot of Fig. \ref{PL-err-Jor1},  $\mbox{err}_J$ is plotted as a function of $M$ for three different working temperatures $T/J=0.4,0.7$ and $1.3$. As we expect, 
 $\mbox{err}_J$  decreases as $M$ increases. This effect was observed also with mean-field inference techniques on the same model\cite{Tyagi15}.

To better understand the performances of the algorithms, in Fig. \ref{PL-varTP-Jor1} we show several True Positive (TP) curves obtained for various values of $M$ at three different temperatures $T$. As $M$ is large and/or temperature is not too small,  we are able to reconstruct correctly all the couplings present in the system (see bottom plots).
The True Positive curve displays how many times the inference method finds a true link of the original network  as a function of the index of the vector of sorted absolute value of reconstructed couplings $J_{ij}^{\rm inf}$. 
The index $n_{(ij)}$ represents the related spin couples $(ij)$. The TP curve is obtained as follows: 
first  the values $|J^{\rm inf}_{ij}|$ are sorted in descending order and  the spin pairs $(ij)$ are ordered according to the sorting position of $|J^{\rm inf}_{ij}|$. Then,
     	a cycle over the ordered set of pairs $(ij)$, indexed by $n_{(ij)}$, is performed, comparing with the original network coupling $J^{\rm true}_{ij}$ and verifying whether it is zero or not. The true positive curve is computed as
\begin{equation}
\mbox{TP}[n_{(ij)}]= \frac{\mbox{TP}\left[n_{(ij)}-1\right] (n_{ij}-1)+ 1 -\delta_{J^{\rm true}_{ij},0}}{n_{(ij)}}
\end{equation}
As far as $J^{\rm true}_{ij} \neq 0$, TP$=1$. As soon as the true coupling of a given $(ij)$ couple in the sorted list is zero, the TP curve departs from one. 
In our case, where the connectivity per spin of the original system is  $c=4$ and there are $N=64$ spins, we know that we will have  $256$ non-zero couplings.  
     	If the inverse problem is successful, hence, we expect a steep decrease of the TP curve when  $n_{ij}=256$ is overcome.

In Fig. \ref{PL-varTP-Jor1}
it is  shown that,  almost independently of $T/J$, the TP score improves as $M$ increases. Results are plotted for three different temperatures, $T=0.4,1$ and $2.2$, with increasing number of samples $M = 64, 128,512$ and $1024$ (clockwise). 
We can clearly appreciate the improvement in temperature if the size of the data-set is not very large: for small $M$, $T=0.4$ performs better. 
When $M$ is high enough (e.g., $M=1024$), instead, the TP curves do not appear to be strongly influenced by the temperature.

\subsection{$XY$ model with complex-valued couplings}
For the complex $XY$ we have to contemporary  infer $2$ apart coupling matrices,  $J^R_{i j}$ and $J^I_{i j}$.  As before, a system of $N=64$ spins is considered on a 2D lattice.
For the couplings we have considered both ordered and bimodal disordered cases.
In Fig. \ref{PL-Jor3}, a single row of the matrix $J$ (top) and the whole sorted couplings (bottom) are displayed for the ordered model (same legend as in Fig. \ref{PL-Jor1}) for the real, $J^R$ (left column), and the imaginary part, $J^I$.

The black line indicates the expected number of decimated couplings, $x^*=(N (N-1) - N c)/2=1888$. As we can see, as $M$ increases, the maximum point of ${\cal L}_t$ approaches $x^*$. Bottom: Different ${\cal L}_t$ curves obtained for different values of T with $M=2048$. We can see that, with this value of $M$, no differences can be appreciated on the maximum points of the different  ${\cal L}_t$ curves.}

    	\label{PLF_peak_statistics}
    \end{figure}
      
      For the ordered real-valued XY model we show in Fig. \ref{var-$t$PLF}, top panel, the outcome on the tilted pseudolikelyhood, $\mathcal{L}_t$ Eq. \eqref{$t$PLF}, of the progressive decimation: from a fully connected lattice  down to an empty lattice. The figure shows the behaviour of $\mathcal{L}_t$ for three different data sizes $M$. A clear data size dependence of the maximum point of  $\mathcal{L}_t$, signalling the most likely value for decimation, is shown. For small $M$ the most likely number of  couplings is overestimated and for increasing $M$ it tends to the true value, as displayed in Fig. \ref{PLF_peak_statistics}.  In the bottom panel of Fig. \ref{var-$t$PLF} we display instead different 
 $\mathcal{L}_t$ curves obtained for three different values of $T$.
  Even though the values of $\mathcal{L}_t$ decrease with increasing temperature, the value of the most likely number of decimated couplings appears to be quite independent on $T$ with $M=2048$ number of samples.
In Fig. \ref{fig:Lt_complex} we eventually display the tilted pseudolikelyhood for a 2D network with complex valued ordered couplings, where the decimation of the real and imaginary coupling matrices proceeds in parallel, that is, 
when a real coupling is small enough to be decimated its imaginary part is also decimated, and vice versa.
One can see that though the apart errors for the real and imaginary parts are different in absolute values, they display the same dip, to be compared with the maximum point of $\mathcal{L}_t$.

     Once the most likely network has been identified through the decimation procedure, we perform the same analysis displayed in Fig. \ref{Jor1_dec}  for ordered and then quenched disordered real-valued couplings
and in Fig. \ref{Jor3_dec} for  complex-valued ordered couplings.  In comparison to the results shown in Sec. \ref{sec:res_reg},
  the PLM with decimation leads to rather cleaner results. In Figs. \ref{MF_PL_err} and \ref{MF_PL_TP} we compare the performances of the PLM with decimation in respect to ones of the PLM with $l_2$-regularization. These two techniques are also analysed in respect to a mean-field technique previously implemented on the same XY systems\cite{Tyagi15}.
  
    For what concerns the network of connecting links, in Fig. \ref{MF_PL_TP} we compare the TP curves obtained with the three techniques. The results refer to the case of ordered and real valued couplings, but similar behaviours were obtained for the other cases analysed. 
  The four graphs are related to different sample sizes, with $M$ increasing clockwise. When $M$ is high enough, all techniques reproduce the true network. 
  However, for lower values of $M$ the performances of the PLM with $l_2$ regularization and with decimation drastically overcome those ones of the previous mean field technique. 
  In particular, for $M=256$ the PLM techniques still reproduce the original network while the mean-field method fails to find more than half of the couplings. 
  When $M=128$, the network is clearly reconstructed only through the PLM with decimation while the PLM with $l_2$ regularization underestimates the couplings. 
  Furthermore, we notice that the PLM method with decimation is able to clearly infer the network of interaction even when $M=N$ signalling that it could be considered also in the under-sampling regime $M<N$.  
 
 
In Fig. \ref{MF_PL_err} we compare the temperature behaviour of the reconstruction error.
In can be observed that for all temperatures and for all sample sizes  the reconstruction error, ${\rm err_J}$, (plotted here in log-scale) obtained with the PLM+decimation is always smaller than 
that one obtained with the other techniques. The temperature behaviour of ${\rm err_J}$ agrees with the one already observed for Ising spins in \cite{Nguyen12b} and for XY spins  in \cite{Tyagi15} with a mean-field approach:  ${\rm err_J}$ displays a minimum around $T\simeq 1$ and then it increases for very lower $T$; however,
 the error obtained with the PLM with decimation is several times smaller  than the error estimated by the other methods.



 
 

     
     \section{Conclusions}
     \label{sec:conc}


Different statistical inference methods have been applied to the inverse problem of the XY model.
After a short review of techniques based on pseudo-likelihood and their formal generalization to the model we have tested their performances against data generated by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations of known instances
with diluted, sparse, interactions.

The main outcome is that the best performances are obtained by means of the  pseudo-likelihood method combined with decimation. Putting to zero (i.e., decimating) very weak bonds, this technique turns out to be very precise for  problems whose real underlying interaction network is sparse, i.e., the number of couplings per variable does not scale with number of variables.
The PLM + decimation method is compared to the PLM + regularization method, with $\ell_2$ regularization and to a mean-field-based method. The behavior of the quality of the network reconstruction is analyzed by looking at the overall sorted couplings and at the single site couplings, comparing them with the real network, and at the true positive curves in all three approaches. In the PLM +decimation method, moreover, the identification of the number of decimated bonds at which the tilted pseudo-likelihood is maximum allows for a precise estimate of the total number of bonds. Concerning this technique, it is also shown that the network with the most likely number of bonds is also the one of least reconstruction error, where not only the prediction of the presence of a bond is estimated but also its value.

The behavior of the inference quality in temperature and in the size of data samples is also investigated, basically confirming the low $T$ behavior hinted by Nguyen and Berg \cite{Nguyen12b} for the Ising model. In temperature, in particular, the reconstruction error curve displays a minimum at a low temperature, close to the critical point in those cases in which a critical behavior occurs, and a sharp increase as temperature goes to zero. The decimation method, once again, appears to enhance this minimum of the reconstruction error of almost an order of magnitude with respect to other methods.
 
The techniques displayed and the results obtained in this work can be of use in any of the many systems whose theoretical representation is given by Eq. \eqref{eq:HXY} or Eq. \eqref{eq:h_im}, some of which are recalled in Sec. \ref{sec:model}. In particular, a possible application can be the field of light waves propagation through random media and the corresponding problem of the  reconstruction of an object seen through an opaque medium or a disordered optical fiber \cite{Vellekoop07,Vellekoop08a,Vellekoop08b, Popoff10a,Akbulut11,Popoff11,Yilmaz13,Riboli14}.

 	","['Physics, biology, social sciences, finance, and neuroscience are some fields in which the inverse problem is encountered.']",6308,multifieldqa_en,en,,c18fe208b75f8f5b4214e2cb17420d75bf525e176e425fc0," The inverse problem aims to find the values of the model parameters that best fit the data. Versions of this problem are encountered in physics, biology, social sciences and finance. A standard approach used in statistical inference is to predict the interaction couplings by maximizing the likelihood function. A further method, substantially improving performances for small data, is the so-called Pseudo-Likelyhood Method (PLM) The developed tools can, actually, be also straightforward applied  to the $p$-clock model, else called vector Potts model, which gives a hierarchy of discretization of the $XY$ model as $p $ increases. We aim at performing statistical inference on a model whose interacting variables are continuous $ XY$ spins, i.e., $\sigma \equiv \left(\cos \phi,\sin \phi\right)$ with $a= 0,1,\dots,p-1$ and $b=0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,82 The inverse problem on the pairwise XY model analyzed here might be of help in recovering images from light propagated through random media. The $XY$ model is well known in statistical mechanics, displaying important physical insights. Phasor and phase models with pairwise and multi-body interaction terms can, indeed, describe the behavior of electromagnetic modes in both linear and nonlinear optical systems. We briefly mention a derivation of the model for light transmission through random scattering media. Scattering of light is held to obstruct our view and make our view of objects, once they enter the material, only after they exit the material. The model has been adopted to describe synchronization problems as the Kuramoto model, and in the theoretical modeling of Josephson junction arrays and arrays of coupled lasers. It has found applications also in other fields, such as in the study of starlings flocks and in quantum and classical physics, as well as in optical systems, including random lasers and opaque fibers. We conclude with conclusive remarks and perspectives on the model and its applications to light propagation and lasing, and its derivation as a proxy for the propagation of light through linear media. We also mention a model for the propagating wave model, which might be applied to linear scattering problems, e.g., propagation of waves in opaque systems or ordered fibers. In a linear dielectric medium, light propagation can be described through a part of the scattering matrix, the transmission matrix. In the most general case, each light mode and its polarization polarization state can be represented by means of the $4$-dimensional Stokes vector. Observed data are a noisy representation of the true values of the fields. In inference problems it is statistically more meaningful to take that noise into account in a probabilistic way, rather than looking at the precise solutions of the exact equations (whose parameters are unknown). To this aim we can introduce Gaussian distributions whose limit for zero variance are the Dirac deltas in Eq. (\ref{eq:deltas)).. We define the function:. We move to consider the ensemble of all possible solutions of E. (eq:transm) at given $\mathbb{T}$, looking at all configurations of fields, thus, defining the function. We can also use a scalar model similar to Eq, but whose variables are the intensities of the outgoing/incoming fields, rather. than the fields themselves. We recall that the elements of the transmission Matrix are random complex coefficients. We use a complex scalar for the case of completely unpolarized modes. ring the transmission matrix through the PLM, we can omit to explicitly include these terms in Eq. \eqref eq:H_J. Taking the same number of incoming and outcoming channels, $N_I=N_O=N/2$, we can drop the ``in'' and ``out'' superscripts and formally write $Z$  as a partition function. Determining the electromagnetic complex configurations that minimize the amplitude that eventually peaked, we call this the initial set of Eqs (Eq. Eqs). As the variance of the transmission Eqs eventually set to 0, the initial cost of the set is 0, and we call it the cost function. We have introduced the effective input- input coupling matrix, where $H$ is a real-valued function by construction, and the whole interaction matrix reads (here $\mathbb{T} \equiv t_{jk} \}$). We call the overall distribution of the distribution around the solutions (Eqs. EQ. Eq.) the ""effective transmission"" matrix, which is the set of all the possible configurations that can be chosen to maximize the amplitude of a given solution. We call this ""the effective transmission"" Matrix, or ""effective input-input coupling matrix,"" is the matrix that maximizes the amplitude. In order to obtain the XY model, it is not necessary that the intensities are strictly quenched (that is also a quite unfeasible situation, I guess).Indeed eq (2) does not deal with the dynamics of the modes, but just connect the in and out ones. In order to test our methods, we generate the input data, i.e., the Monte-Carlo simulations of the model. The joint probability distribution of $N$ variables follows the Gibbs-Boltz distribution. In the rest of this section we implement the working equations for the techniques used. We want to show that $N’s are inhomogeneous with respect to phases. The generic Hamiltonian element will, therefore, rescale as   E^*_n J_{nm} E_m = J_nm} A_n A_m e^{\imath (\phi_n- \phi_m)    The XY model is written as the real-valued Hamiltonian, whose real- valued Hamiltonian is called the “XY’ model” and is called “Pseudolikelihood Maximization”. We will use this model in the next section of the paper. The underlying idea of PLM is that an approximation of the true parameters of the model is obtained for values that maximize the functions $L_i$. We will adopt an $l_2$ regularization so that the Pseudolikelihood function (PLF) at site $i$ reads: L_i = L-L-L. The standard implementation of the PLM consists in maximizing each $i=1\dots N$ separately. The expected values of the couplings are then: H_i^{(\mu) \cos( \phi_i (i) - \alpha_i (i) $ and $H_i^y ($i). The final estimate for $J_ij$ can be obtained by averaging the two results: J_ij(J) and J-J (J) The model is Hermitian, while the imaginary part is symmetric while the skew-mmetric part is skew-symmetric. It is useful to add a regularizer, which prevents the maximization routine to move towards high values of   $J_{ij}$ and $h_i$ without converging. For example, we can use the regularizer to ensure that $J-J$ is not too large, in order not to overcome $L-J. A new method, PLM + decimation, maximizes the sum of the $L_i$ sum. It recursively set to zero couplings which are estimated very small. A point is reached where the number of decimated couplings decreases abruptly. This indicates that relevant couplings are being decimated and under-fitting is taking place. In Fig. 1 we give an instance of this behavior for the 2D short-range XY model with ordered couplings. We stress that the maximum is obtained ignoring the underlying graph, and that the err$$ minimum can be evaluated once the true graph has been reconstructed. The peak of the model with $N64 spins coincides with the dip of the error of the reconstruction. We call this the ‘t tilted’ curve and the likelyhood is the reconstruction error vs. the reconstruction curve. For an ordered XY model on 2, J, on 2-valued spins, we call this ‘the real-valued curve’ and the tilted curve is the “real-valued” curve. The ‘true’ graph is the one with the $N(N-1)/2’ spins on it, and we call it ‘‘’’. The dynamics of the simulated model is based on the Metropolis algorithm and parallel tempering is used to speed up the thermalization of the system. The results here presented were obtained with bimodal distributed $J$s. The performances of the PLM have shown not to depend on $P(J)$. The results are plotted as a function of temperature (left column) and the number of samples (right column) for three values of $M$ and $T/J=0.7$ The results show that PLM appears to reconstruct the correct couplings, though zero couplings are always given a small inferred non-zero value. In particular, note that the infers half positive and half negative coupling, as expected, are shown as negative and half positive, respectively, for the same working temperature, for a given number and number of  samples. We can clearly see that $M=1024$ reproduces the expected step function, even though the jump is smeared, the difference between inferred couplings corresponding to the set of non- Zero couplings can be clearly appreciated, and to theSet of zero coupling can be also appreciated. The analysis of the results was carried out by the University of California, San Diego, using a computer simulation of a 2D lattice with periodic boundary conditions. The True Positive (TP) curve displays how many times the inference method finds a true link of the original network as a function of the index of the vector of sorted absolute value of reconstructed couplings. TP curves do not appear to be strongly influenced by the temperature. Results are plotted for three different temperatures, $T=0.4,1$ and $2.2, with increasing number of samples $M = 64, 128,512 and $1024$ (clockwise) The TP score improves as $M$ increases. This effect was observed also with mean-field inference techniques on the same model. For the couplings we have considered both ordered bimodal and ordered disordered cases. We have used the complex $XY$ model with $N=64$ spins at three different values of $T/J$ with increasing - clockwise from top - $M$. The TP curves are displayed for the ordered model (top) and the whole sorted couplings (bottom) for the real model (R-J) for $M=64, a single row of the real lattice $J, a row of $J-R, a column of $D-J, and a rows of $I-J-J$ for the complex model. Fig. 1 shows the tilted pseudolikelyhood for a 2D network with complex valued ordered couplings. As we can see, as $M$ increases, the maximum point of $L_t$ approaches $x^*$. The value of the most likely number of decimated couplings appears to be quite independent on $T$ with $M=2048$ number of samples. We can see that when a real coupling is small enough to be decimated its imaginary part is also decimated, and vice versa. The results refer to the ordered real-valued XY model we show in Fig. 1 for the real and imaginary couplings respectively. We see that both can be shown to have a minimum minimum number of zero couplings at $T=1.3$. The black line indicates the expected number of couplings, $x*=(N (N-1) - N c)/2=1888). We show the reconstruction errors for the full and complex valued couplings for the XY model in the figure in the bottom panel of Fig. 2. The dashed (green) and dotted (blue) lines show the Reconstruction errors (Eq.:errj) obtained for thereal and imaginary coupling matrices in the network. lued couplings. Top figures refer to a single site reconstruction, i.e., one row of the matrix $J$. Bottom figures report the couplings sorted in descending order. The temperature is here $T=0.7$ while the four graphs refer to different sample sizes: $M$ increases clockwise. The results refer to the case of ordered and real valued couplings, but similar behaviours were obtained for the other cases analysed. When $M=256$ the PLM techniques still reproduce the original network while the mean-field fails to find half of the coupling. The PLM with decimation is able to clearly infer the network of interaction even when $M =N=N+1. The network is clearly reconstructed only more than once with the decimation method. In comparison to the results shown in Sec. \ref{sec:res_reg, the PLm with decimating leads to rather cleaner results.  The results show that for all sample sizes and temperatures the reconstruction error is the same for all reconstruction methods. We compare the behaviour of the reconstruction methods with that of the mean field technique to see if they are equally effective at reconstructing the same network. We conclude that the network can be clearly inferred even when the network is under-sampling. The best performances are obtained by means of the  pseudo-likelihood method combined with decimation. This technique turns out to be very precise for problems whose underlying interaction network is sparse. The techniques displayed and the results obtained in this work can be of use in any of the many systems whose theoretical representation is given by Eq. \eqref{eq:HXY} or Eq:h_im. In particular, a possible application can be the field of light waves propagation through random media and the corresponding problem of the reconstruction of an object seen through an opaque medium or a disordered optical fiber. The behavior of the inference quality in temperature and in the size of data samples is also investigated, basically confirming the low $T$ behavior hinted by Nguyen and Berg for the Ising model."
What is the maximum radius of the emitting region for the black body model?,"\section{Introduction}

The publicly available XMM-Newton slew data covers to date around 35\%
of the sky. The soft band (0.2$-$2 keV) sensitivity limit of the slews
(6$\times10^{-13}$\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) is close to that of the
ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS; Voges et al.\ 1999), and in the medium
(2$-$12 keV) band, the slew data goes significantly deeper
(4$\times10^{-12}$\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) than all other previous
large area surveys. Over 7700 individual sources have so far been
detected to a positional accuracy of 8\arcsec.  For details on the
the construction and
characteristics of the first released XMM-Newton slew survey
catalogue, see Saxton et al. (2008). For details of the initial
science results from the slew survey, see Read et al. (2006).

The comparison of XMM-Newton slew data with the RASS is now giving,
for the first time, the opportunity to find exotic, extreme
high-variability X-ray bursting objects, e.g. tidal disruption
candidates (Esquej et al. 2007), and also Galactic novae, flare stars,
and flaring white dwarfs, plus eclipsing binaries, AGN and blazars. It
is only with such a large-area survey as the XMM-Newton Slew Survey,
that transient events as these have a chance of being caught.

One such rare event, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933, which we here show to be
a new Classical Nova, was discovered in an XMM-Newton slew from 18th
July 2006 at a very high count rate of 23.3\,ct s$^{-1}$ (EPIC-pn:
0.2$-$2\,keV). 

Classical novae (see Bode \& Evans 2008 for a review) occur in
interacting binary systems consisting of a white dwarf primary star
and a lower-mass secondary star. The nova itself is a cataclysmic
nuclear explosion caused by the accretion of material (via Roche Lobe
overflow or wind accretion) from the secondary star onto the surface
of the white dwarf; here the pressure and temperature at the base of
the accreted material becomes sufficient to trigger a thermonuclear
runaway. A recent review of the thermonuclear processes powering
classical novae can be found in Starrfield et al.\ (2008).  The
accreted material is partially expelled, obscuring the X-ray emission
from the surface of the white dwarf. At later stages, the ejected
material expands further and becomes optically thin, revealing the
nuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf.  This emission
peaks in the soft X-ray regime and it is known as the super-soft
source (SSS) state (Krautter 2008). Models of the classical nova SSS
state can be found in Tuchman \& Truran (1998) and Sala \& Hernanz
(2005).

Though many classical novae have been observed in X-rays in their SSS
states (Ness et al.\ (2007) for example discuss several examples observed with
Swift), it is in the optical band, early in their outbursts, that
classical novae are almost always discovered. This is because they are
intrinsically optically bright and easily found in inexpensive
wide-area shallow surveys.  XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is very unusual
therefore in that it has been discovered, as we shall see, later in
its evolution, in the SSS X-ray state.

In this paper we describe the XMM-Newton slew observations
(Section~2), and the follow-up X-ray observations by the Swift XRT
(Section~3) and XMM-Newton (Section~4). Multiwavelength observations
with Swift-UVOT, Magellan and ASAS are described in Section~5. We then
present a discussion of the results (Section~6), and conclusions.

\section{XMM-Newton slew observations}

XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 was discovered in XMM-Newton slew 9121000003
from revolution 1210 on 18th July 2006. Details of the standard
XMM-Newton slew data reduction and analysis used, plus the
source-searching and catalogue cross-correlation etc., are presented
in Saxton et al.  (2008).

The source passed through the EPIC-pn detector in 14\,s, at a small
off-axis angle, such that an effective vignetting-corrected soft band
(0.2$-$2\,keV) exposure time of 9.8\,s was achieved.  A total of 229
source counts lie within a radius of 20\arcsec, yielding a (EPIC-pn:
0.2$-$2\,keV) count rate of 23.4\,ct s$^{-1}$.

The source is seen to have no cross-correlation identifications in the
RASS, and no other multiwavelength candidates within 30\arcsec\ in
Simbad\footnote{http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/},
NED\footnote{http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html}, and
HEASARC\footnote{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/}. The position of the
source in the sky is such that it lies apparently at the outer eastern
edge of the LMC.

XMM-Newton has slewed over this region of sky a number of times, and
though nothing was detected in previous slews from 7th November 2001
and 12th January 2004, the source was seen again on 28th September
2006 (rev.\,1246, 72 days after the rev.\,1210 discovery), at the same
position, but at a reduced flux level (3.8\,ct s$^{-1}$; EPIC-pn:
0.2$-$2\,keV).  i.e. it had reduced in flux by a factor of $\approx$6
in 72 days. XMM-Newton has not slewed over this area of sky since
rev.\,1246. Details of the relevant XMM-Newton slews, together with
the (0.2$-$2\,keV) EPIC-pn source position, detected source counts,
count rate and detection likelihood are given in
Table~\ref{slewtable}.

The fact that XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 is detected in the total-band
(0.2$-$12\,keV) and the soft-band (0.2$-$2\,keV), whilst effectively
zero counts are seen in the hard-band (2$-$12\,keV), is immediately
indicative of the source being very soft. 

The moderately high count rate indicates that the spectrum is affected
by pile-up (the on-axis limit is 6\,ct s$^{-1}$ for EPIC-pn full-frame
mode
\footnote{http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm\_user\_support/documentation
  /uhb\_2.5/index.html}). This distorts the spectrum and makes
quantitative spectral analysis of the slew data difficult. We
minimized these effects by following the standard procedure, i.e.
ignoring the central part of the Point Spread Function (PSF), and
extracted an event spectrum (containing single and double events) of
the source from within an annulus of 5\arcsec$-$30\arcsec\ radius,
centred on the source position. Unresolved problems associated with
the motion of sources across the detector still exist within slew
data, and approximations currently have to be made when calculating
the associated effective area and detector response matrix files. In
order to perform qualitative spectral analysis, an effective area file
was generated by averaging the individual core-removed effective area
files at 9 different positions along the detector track made by the
source. This accounts for the removal of the piled-up core, and takes
the vignetting and PSF variations into account to a good
approximation.  Individual BACKSCAL values have been set by hand, as
have the EXPOSURE values, estimated by calculating the distance
travelled by the source in detector coordinates and finding the time
taken to do this, given a 90\,deg\,hr$^{-1}$ slew speed, then
subtracting the appropriate fractions for chip gaps and bad pixels.
For the response matrix, we used the equivalent canned detector
response matrix for the vignetting-weighted average source position,
for single plus double events and for full-frame mode:
epn\_ff20\_sdY6\_v6.9.rmf. A background spectrum was extracted from a
much larger circular region close to the source and at a similar
off-axis angle.

To fit the slew spectral data, and indeed all the high-energy spectra
in the present paper, the
XSPEC\footnote{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xanadu/xspec/}
spectral fitting package has been used. As $\chi^2$ minimization is
not valid when fitting spectra of low statistical quality, for the
fitting of the slew spectrum (and all the spectral fitting in the
present paper), C-statistics have been used. To take into account the
absorbing column along the line of sight, the {\em wabs} model with
the {\em wilm} cosmic abundance table (Wilms et al.\ 2000) has been
used throughout the paper. All the errors quoted in the present paper
are 90\% confidence intervals, unless otherwise stated.

The rev.\,1210 slew spectrum shows that the source is very soft, and
appears consistent with a 63$_{-10}^{+12}$\,eV black body, absorbed by
a hydrogen column density of
8.2$_{-4.1}^{+5.4}\times10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$. The fit is good, with a
P-statistic value of 0.11, obtained via the XSPEC {\em goodness}
command for this fit, based on 5000 random simulations. The best-fit
hydrogen column is equal to the full Galactic hydrogen column in the
direction of the source (8.0$\pm{1.1}\times10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$; Dickey
\& Lockman, 1990, calculated via the FTOOL {\em
  nh}\footnote{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/ftools/fhelp/nh.txt}).
The slew spectrum, plus the best fit simple black body model and the
deviations from the model, are shown in Fig.\,\ref{slewspec}. The
observed count rate corresponds to a (0.2$-$2\,keV) flux, corrected
for the removal of the saturated PSF core, of
4.8$^{+2.7}_{-1.6}\times10^{-11}$\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (an
increase in flux over the RASS upper limit, assuming the same spectral
model, by a factor of more than 500).

Simple power-law, thermal Bremmstrahlung, and other optically thin hot
plasma models are unable to fit the spectrum adequately well.  Given
that we later are able to identify the source as a nova (Section~5.2),
then the black-body model will likely be a good approximation.
Furthermore, as we have obtained here a moderate number of slew
counts, the more physically realistic, though more complex atmosphere
model for CO white dwarfs of MacDonald \& Vennes (1991), provided by
K.\,Page (private communication), was attempted.  This model, used
e.g. to model the nova V1974 Cyg (Balman et al.\ 1998), yielded a
marginal fit (and not formally a more statistically significant fit;
P-statistic = 0.03, based on 5000 random simulations), with an
effective temperature of 70$^{+8}_{-6}$\,eV, an $N_{\rm H}$ of
3.7$^{+3.2}_{-2.5}$$\times$$10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$, and a PSF-corrected
(0.2$-$2\,keV) flux of 4.5$^{+1.3}_{-1.8}\times10^{-11}$\,ergs
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Note that a smaller $N_{\rm H}$ (though perhaps
still consistent with the full Galactic hydrogen column) is now
obtained using the white dwarf atmosphere model. (Note that the
MacDonald \& Vennes (1991) ONe white dwarf atmosphere model was also
attempted, but yielded a marginally worse fit than the CO white dwarf
atmosphere model; only the CO atmosphere model has been used in the
subsequent analysis).

It is well known (e.g. Krautter et al.\ 1996) that, because of the
energy-dependent opacity in the white dwarf atmosphere, fits to super
soft source novae spectra with black body models give larger fluxes
and lower temperatures than atmosphere models fit to the same spectra,
and this is seen in the present case. Thus the black body model
requires a larger $N_{\rm H}$ to fit the same data than the atmosphere
model, as is seen. 

The model normalizations, corrected for the removal
of the saturated PSF core, can be used to derive an approximate
distance to the source.  If we assume a typical emitting region for
the white dwarf atmosphere to be of spherical radius 10$^{9}$\,cm,
then, for the black body model, this distance turns out to be
20$^{+31}_{-10}$\,kpc. The effects discussed above however can lead to
usage of the black body model giving rise to an underestimation of the
distance.  For the white dwarf atmosphere model, a larger distance of
71$^{+27}_{-23}$\,kpc is obtained. Both estimates are consistent with
the distance to the LMC ($\sim$50\,kpc, see Section~6), and assuming a
distance of 50\,kpc, the black body derived flux corresponds to a
(pile-up corrected) 0.2$-$2\,keV X-ray luminosity of
1.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\times10^{37}$\,ergs s$^{-1}$.

\section{Swift XRT X-ray observations}

We requested and received a prompt observation with Swift of this
source before it moved out of the Swift visibility window in April
2007. We received over 14\,ksec of Swift-XRT time in 7
separate observations and the details of these observations are listed
in Table~\ref{xrttable}. All of the observations were in photon
counting mode and none of the observations showed any times of
significant high-BG flux. In none of the observations did the source
position coincide with any of the dead (micrometeorite-induced)
detector columns. The analysis has been performed using HEASOFT
v6.1.2. The individual XRT observations were astrometrically-corrected
and then stacked to ascertain a best Swift-XRT position $-$ this was
found to be 06 06 37.00 -69 49 33.9 (with a 90\% error radius of
4.0\arcsec). Source counts were then extracted from each observation
from a circle of radius of 40\arcsec\ at this position. Background
counts were extracted from each observation from large-radius
off-source circles close to the source position. Source counts and
count rates for the individual XRT observations are given in
Table~\ref{xrttable}.


\begin{table}
  \caption[]{Details of the Swift-XRT observations (observation ID, observation date and 
    cleaned exposure time) are tabulated, together with the total (0.2$-$2.0\,keV) background-subtracted

\label{xrttable}
\end{table}

The observation naturally fell into three time-separated groups, those
of obs.\,1, obs.\,2-5 and obs.\,6-7. A similar analysis applied to
these groups (where the statistics are improved) gives rise to source
counts and count rates of 76.7$\pm$9.3\,counts and
0.0090$\pm$0.0011\,ct~s$^{-1}$ (for obs.\,2-5), and
33.0$\pm$6.2\,counts and 0.0084$\pm$0.0016\,ct~s$^{-1}$ (for
obs.\,6-7). (Analysis of all the data together yields
133.6$\pm$12.3\,counts and 0.0092$\pm$0.0009\,ct~s$^{-1}$). 

A spectrum was extracted from all the Swift-XRT data from a 40\arcsec\
radius circle, using grades 0$-$12, centred on the Swift-XRT position.
A background spectrum was extracted again from all the Swift-XRT data,
from large-radius off-source circles close to the source position. An
ARF file was created using {\em xrtmkarf} and the appropriate RMF
(swxpc0to12\_20010101v008.rmf) from the Swift-XRT Calibration Database
was obtained.

Standard spectral models were again fit to the spectral data using
XSPEC. Again, C-statistics were used, as was the {\em wabs} absorption
model with the {\em wilm} cosmic abundance table. It was again 
obvious that only a very soft spectrum would be appropriate for the
data, and the only simple model that was able to fit the data
adequately was a black-body model of temperature
$kT$=$59^{+14}_{-10}$\,eV, with an absorbing hydrogen column of
9.5$^{+5.0}_{-3.9}$$\times$$10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$. No sufficiently constrained parameters could
be obtained using the CO white dwarf atmosphere model (MacDonald \&
Vennes 1991). The Swift-XRT spectrum, together with the best-fit black
body model is shown in Fig.\,\ref{xrtspec}. The corresponding
(0.2$-$2.0\,keV) flux is 2.7$^{+0.7}_{-1.2}\times10^{-13}$\,ergs
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (i.e. a reduction by more than a factor 100 from
the XMM-Newton slew discovery flux), and the X-ray luminosity, for the
assumed distance of 50\,kpc, is 8.0$^{+2.2}_{-3.5}\times10^{34}$\,ergs
s$^{-1}$.

\begin{figure}

  points (crosses; adjacent data bins having been grouped together for

  a black body model (kT=59\,eV; see text). The source has faded by a
  factor of $>100$ since the XMM-Newton revolution 1210 slew
  discovery. The solid line show the best fit to the spectra.  The
  ratio of the data to the best fit model is shown in the lower panel.
}
\label{xrtspec}
\end{figure}

A cautious estimate of the size of the emitting region can be obtained
from the model normalization; the assumed distance of 50\,kpc yields a
maximum radius of 4.5$\times$10$^{8}$\,cm (the fit normalization is
essentially unconstrained at the lower bound).  Though great care
should be taken in interpreting this result, as the black body model
is possibly overestimating the luminosity, this obtained radius is
still consistent with that of moderately massive ($>$1.1$M_{\odot}$)
white dwarfs (Hamada \& Salpeter 1961), i.e.\,the whole white dwarf
surface may still be emitting at 59\,eV.

\section{Dedicated XMM-Newton observations}

We were granted an XMM-Newton Target of Opportunity (ToO) observation,
once the source became again visible to XMM-Newton, and a 10\,ks
XMM-Newton EPIC observation was made on 19th June 2007 (see
Table~\ref{slewtable}). All the XMM-Newton EPIC data, i.e.  the data
from the two MOS cameras and the single pn camera, were taken in
full-frame mode with the thin filter in place.  These data from the
three EPIC instruments have been reprocessed using the standard
procedures in XMM-Newton SAS (Science Analysis System) $-$ v.7.1.0.
Periods of high-background, of which there were very few, were
filtered out of each dataset by creating a high-energy 10$-$15\,keV
lightcurve of single events over the entire field of view, and
selecting times when this lightcurve peaked above 0.75\,ct s$^{-1}$
(for pn) or 0.25\,ct s$^{-1}$ (for MOS). This resulted in
$\approx$9.4(8.0)\,ks of low-background MOS(pn) data. Details of this dedicated
XMM-Newton observation, together with source position, and
(0.2$-$2\,keV) all-EPIC combined (pn, MOS1, MOS2) detected source
counts, count rate and detection likelihood are given in
Table~\ref{slewtable}.

Source spectra, containing single and double events, were extracted
from the datasets from circles (none of the data were now piled up)
centred on the source position. An extraction radius, estimated from
where the radial surface brightness profile was seen to fall to the
surrounding background level, was set to 30\arcsec. Background spectra
were extracted from each cleaned dataset from a 40\arcsec$-$80\arcsec\
annulus centred on the source position. Point sources seen to
contaminate these larger-area background spectra were removed from the
background spectra to a radius of 60\arcsec. ARF files were created
for the source spectra, and were checked to confirm that the correct
extraction area calculations had been performed. Finally RMF response
files were generated.
 
Standard spectral models were again fit to the spectral data using
XSPEC. Once again it was obvious that only a very soft model would fit the data; the only
simple model that was able to fit the data well (a P-statistic = 0.17,
based on 5000 random simulations) was a black-body model of
temperature $kT$=70$^{+3}_{-4}$\,eV, with an absorbing hydrogen column
of 6.9$^{+1.0}_{-1.6}\times10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$. The spectrum, together with this best-fit
model are shown in Fig.\,\ref{xmmspec}. The corresponding
(0.2$-$2.0\,keV) flux is only marginally less than the Swift-XRT value
at 2.2$^{+0.8}_{-0.9}\times10^{-13}$\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and the
X-ray luminosity (for the assumed distance of 50\,kpc) is
6.7$^{+2.5}_{-2.8}\times10^{34}$\,ergs s$^{-1}$.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[bb=110 15 570 705,clip,width=6.0cm,angle=270]{12082f3.ps}
\caption{XMM-Newton ToO spectrum from XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933. The
  data points (crosses; adjacent data bins having been grouped
  together for the plot to have a significance of at least 3)) have
  been fitted again with a black body model (kT=70\,eV) (see text).
  EPIC-pn data is shown in black, with EPIC-MOS1 in red and EPIC-MOS2
  in green. The solid lines show the best fit to the spectra.  The
  ratios of the data to the best fit model are shown in the lower
  panel.}
\label{xmmspec}
\end{figure}

Given that, in this XMM-Newton ToO observation, we had obtained a
larger number of counts ($\raisebox{-1mm}{$\stackrel{>}{\sim}$}$1500 over the 3 EPIC cameras), the
physically more realistic CO white dwarf atmosphere model (MacDonald \&
Vennes 1991) was also attempted. This yielded a marginal fit (and formally
a no more statistically significant fit; P-statistic = 0.04, based on
5000 random simulations), with an effective temperature of
73$^{+3}_{-2}$\,eV, and an $N_{\rm H}$ of
3.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.8}$$\times$$10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$. Again, usage of the black body model results
in a larger fitted $N_{\rm H}$ and a lower fitted temperature than
with the atmosphere model. 


As before, the model normalization can be used to obtain a cautious
estimate of the size of the emitting region. For the assumed distance
of 50\,kpc, then the black body model returns an emitting region
radius of only 1.3$\pm$0.2$\times$10$^{8}$\,cm.  Again care should be
taken, as this may be an overestimation, the black body model having
perhaps overestimated the luminosity. For the white dwarf atmosphere
model, a smaller radius of 0.4$\pm$0.1$\times$10$^{8}$\,cm is
obtained. Note further that the assumption of a larger distance (see
Section~6) would result in a proportionally larger emitting radius.
The range in allowed radius therefore is quite large, and it is not
impossible for for the whole of the white dwarf surface to be emitting
at 70\,eV. If this is the case, then the white dwarf would have to be
at the high end of the mass range ($>$1.2$M_{\odot}$; Hamada \&
Salpeter 1961). It may be the case then that we are at this point at,
or close to the end of the SSS phase, where the effective temperature
has reached a maximum (Sala \& Hernanz 2005), as is tentatively seen
in the spectral fitting results, and where the photospheric radius has
reached a minimum, close to the white dwarf radius.


\subsection{X-ray variability}

The full (XMM-Newton slew plus Swift-XRT plus XMM-Newton ToO) X-ray
lightcurve of XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 is shown in
Fig.\,\ref{lightcurve}. The calculated (0.2$-$2.0\,keV) flux values
are shown plotted against the number of days since the rev.\,1210
XMM-Newton Slew discovery. The first two data points are the
rev.\,1210 and the rev.\,1246 XMM-Newton Slew observations. Then the
three nested Swift-XRT points are shown and finally the XMM-Newton ToO
observation. The level of RASS upper limit is shown to the bottom
left. The (0.2$-$2.0\,keV) X-ray flux is seen to have dropped by more
than two orders of magnitude in 230 days since the discovery, but is
then seen to have levelled off for the next 120 days, at a level still
$\approx$3 times that of the RASS. Finally, no evidence for any
short-term variability (using time bins down to 100\,s) is seen in the
highest statistic continuous X-ray lightcurve (the $\approx$8.0\,ksec
background-filtered EPIC-pn lightcurve) obtained from the 19/06/07
XMM-Newton observation.

\subsection{Swift UVOT}

For the Feb/Mar 2007 Swift observations, we arranged for both the
Swift UVOT-B filter and the UVOT-UVW2 filters to be used in an
approximate exposure time ratio of 1:5, thus ensuring roughly equal
numbers of counts in the two bands (though there is a spectral type
dependency here). Swift UVOT images in these two filters of the area
of sky around XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 are shown in Fig.\,\ref{uvot}.

Prior to the Swift UVOT observations, a `best-guess' to the possible
candidate optical/IR counterpart would have been the USNO-A2.0 source
0150-04066298 (B~mag: 17.4, R~mag: 16.1), seen 4\arcsec\ south of the
XMM-Newton slew position. The UVOT images however immediately showed
that the optically fainter source at position RA, Dec (J2000) = 06 06
36.4, -69 49 34.3 (error radius: ~0.5\arcsec) was a very strong UVW2
source and very blue, and was very likely the true counterpart to
XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933. (The UVW2 filter spans approximately
800\AA\,, centred at $\approx$1900\AA)

  the XMM-Newton Slew position. The small circle in the UVW2 image around the
  bright source is reproduced in the B image, indicating that a faint
  optical source is also visible at this position.}
\label{uvot}
\end{figure}

The Swift UVOT pipeline processed data were analysed using the UVOT
photometry package {\em uvotsource} released with
FTOOLs\footnote{http://heasarc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/ftools/ftools\_menu.html}.
This package performs aperture photometry on pre-specified source and
background regions, accounting for photometric- (via PSF fitting) and
coincidence loss- effects using the UVOT calibration files. Source
counts were extracted using a 5\arcsec\ radius aperture centred on the
source, while for the background we used a 10\arcsec\ radius aperture
located in a nearby source-free region.  We used a larger background
aperture to effectively smooth over the modulo-8 fixed pattern noise
present in UVOT observations and to improve the statistics of the
background counts. Source counts were converted to UVOT UV-magnitudes
using the UVW2 zero-point calibration released with version~2.8 (Build
22) of the CALDB. The source is seen (see Fig.\,\ref{uvotlc}) to be
roughly constant over the short duration of the Swift observations,
with a suggestion of a decline towards the end. This is in keeping
with the general form of the X-ray lightcurve (Fig.\,\ref{lightcurve})
at this time.

\begin{figure}

  00030895002, 00030895004, 00030895005, 00030895006 \& 00030895007
  (hence the points span the dates 07/03/07 to 22/03/07). The errors here are 1-$\sigma$. }
\label{uvotlc}
\end{figure}

It is possible to include the UVOT-detected flux with the XRT spectrum
described in Section~3. UVOT files, created using {\em uvot2pha} for
the five observations (00030895002, 00030895004, 00030895005,
00030895006 \& 00030895007) where the UVW2 filter was employed, were
incorporated into {\em xspec}, along with the appropriate response
file (swuw2\_20041120v104.rsp) from the Swift-XRT Calibration
Database. We attempted to fit a single black-body spectrum to the
Swift-XRT+UV data (again using C-statistics, the {\em wabs} absorption
model and the {\em wilm} cosmic abundance table, plus the inclusion of
the {\em xspec-redden} component to model the absorption in the UV
band). The best fit however, with a much lower temperature of
$kT$=$36^{+3}_{-4}$\,eV, is a very poor fit to the data; we obtain a
{\em goodness} P-statistic value of 0.00, based on 5000 random
simulations. This notwithstanding, a flux in the UVW2
(1.57$-$7.77\,eV) band of 3.5$\pm{0.2}\times10^{-13}$\,ergs cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ can be obtained, corresponding to a UVW2 luminosity, for the
assumed distance of 50\,kpc, of 1.0$\pm{0.1}\times10^{35}$\,ergs
s$^{-1}$.

The very poor single black-body fit above, plus the large change in
fitted temperature is strongly suggestive that a model other than, or
in addition to the XRT-derived kT=59\,eV black body model (Section~3)
should be used to describe the UVW2 data. As we have no UV data other
than in the UVW2 filter, all that can be done is to apply the
XRT-derived black body model to the UVW2+XRT data, and in doing this,
a large flux excess with respect to the XRT-derived black body model
is seen in the UVW2 band. This is shown in Fig.\ref{xrtuvotspec}. This
excess in UV emission (most of the $10^{35}$\,ergs s$^{-1}$ discussed
above) is likely due to a combination of residual post-nova nuclear
burning on the surface of the white dwarf, plus accretion in the disk,
including from emission lines. The situation is likely to be rather
complex, depending on the structure of both the ejecta and the
accretion disk, and is beyond the scope of the present work, where we
only have sparse UV data.  For a review of the UV emission from
classical novae, see Shore (2008).

\subsection{Magellan optical observations}

On Nov.~13, 14, and 15, 2007, XMMSL1~J060636.2--694933 was observed
with the Low--Dispersion Survey Spectrograph 3 (LDSS3) mounted on the
Magellan Clay telescope. Images were obtained through the Sloan
$g^\prime$, $r^\prime$ and $i^\prime$ filters. On Nov.~15, 2007
conditions were photometric and the Landolt field RU 149A was observed
to flux calibrate the data in the $g^\prime$, $r^\prime$ and
$i^\prime$--bands.  The Landolt (1992) magnitudes of the standards
were converted to Sloan magnitudes using the transformations presented
in Smith et al.\ (2002). All the images were debiased and flatfielded
using dome flatfield frames. We applied aperture photometry on each of
the images using DAOPHOT in \textsc{IRAF}\footnote{\textsc {iraf} is
  distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories} to
compute the instrumental magnitudes of the stars. Differential
photometry of the optical counterpart to XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933
(marked by an arrow in Fig.~\ref{magellan}) was performed with respect
to the field star (marked with a `c' in Fig.~\ref{magellan}). This was the
brightest isolated and unsaturated star common to all frames.  The
calibrated brightness of this comparison star is $g'= 18.42 \pm 0.04$,
$r'= 17.85 \pm 0.06$ and $i'=17.58 \pm 0.07$.

  shown marked with a 'c'.}
\label{magellan}
\end{figure}

In addition to the imaging observations described above, we have
obtained spectroscopic observations on Nov.~13, 14, and 15, 2007 using
the VPH All grism, which has 660 lines per mm, and employing a
1\arcsec\ wide slit. This set-up provides a mean dispersion of 2\AA\,
per pixel. For a slit width of 1 arcsecond and a mean seeing close to
1\arcsec, the mean spectral resolution is $\approx$10\AA. On Nov.~13, 2007
we took 4 exposures of 450\,s each, on Nov.~14, 2007 we took 2
exposures of 900\,s each, and on Nov.~15, 2007 we took one 1200\,s
exposure with the slit at the parallactic angle. The spectra were bias
and flatfield corrected, and extracted in \textsc{IRAF}. The
instrumental response was corrected using the spectrophotometric flux
calibrators LTT 3218 (Nov.~13), H600 (Nov.~14) and LTT 9293 (Nov.~15).
Significant differences in the flux around H$\alpha$ are apparent with
the flux being 50\% higher during the Nov.~15, 2007 with respect to
the Nov.~13, 2007 observations. Since there is no evidence for
brightening in the $r^\prime$ images we attribute the difference to
the fact that the source was not observed at the parallactic angle on
Nov.~13 and 14, 2007. We exported the one dimensional spectra to the
spectral analysis software package \textsc{molly} for further
analysis.

  associated with XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933. The flux scaling is
  approximate. The prominent strong emission lines are marked (see
  text). }
\label{optspec}
\end{figure}

We have averaged all spectra (see Fig.~\ref{optspec}). We find several
strong emission lines. The strongest of these emission lines are best
interpreted as due to [OIII] 4958.9\AA\, and 5006.9\AA\,, He~II at
4685.8\AA\, and a blend of the H$\alpha$ plus the [NII] at 6548.1\AA\,
and 6583.4\AA\,, lines found often in novae (Williams 1992). In this
case the main [OIII] lines appear redshifted by approximately 2000\,km
s$^{-1}$. We interprete this as due to clumpy outflows in the nova
shell. The integrated light from different outflowing parts can also
explain the substructure that is present in the [OIII] lines. The
outflow velocities that we obtain for the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines
is $\approx$350\,km s$^{-1}$, hence less than that for the [OIII]
lines.  Note that, if XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 does reside within the
LMC, then the systematic line-of-sight recession velocity of the LMC,
262$\pm$3.4\,km~s$^{-1}$ (van der Marel et al.\ 2002), should be taken
into account; i.e.\,a good fraction of the observed H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$
recession would then be due to the recession of the LMC itself.

\subsection{Long-term Optical light curve}

Analysis of archival robotic optical survey data from 3-minute CCD
exposures (pixel size 14\arcsec.8), obtained with a 70\,mm (200\,mm
focal length) f/2.8 telephoto lens in the course of the All Sky
Automated Survey (ASAS; Pojmanski 2002) show that the visual magnitude
of this source rose from m$_{V}\raisebox{-1mm}{$\stackrel{>}{\sim}$}$14 to m$_{V}$$\approx$12 between
Sep.~18, 2005 and Sep.~30, 2005, and then declined rapidly thereafter (see
Fig.\ref{optlc}). ASAS did not detect any significant emission from
the source after around November 2005, the source having dimmed below
the limiting magnitude of ASAS.

The decline from the brightest data point ($\approx$2.2 magnitudes in
10 days, then a further $\sim$1.3 magnitudes in 46 days) suggests that
this is a nova of the 'very fast' speed class (Warner 1995, Downes
et al.\ 2001). We estimate that the time that the light curve takes to
decline 2 magnitudes below maximum observed brightness is
8$\pm$2\,days (see Section~6).

\section{Discussion}

The optical spectrum, showing lines of [OIII] 4958.9\AA\, and
5006.9\AA\,, He~II at 4685.8\AA\, and a blend of the H$\alpha$ plus
[NII] at 6548.1\AA\, and 6583.4\AA\, suggests that
XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 was a nova, observed (in Nov 2007) in the late
A$_{0}$ auroral phase. The fact that the observed [OIII] lines are not
in the more usual, optically thin 3:1 ratio, can be explained in terms
of a clumpy outflow scenario, whereby individual clumps of both
rest-frame and redward-shifted material are observed, and the
superposition of these account for the observed [OIII] ratio (note
further that density enhancements can change observed [OIII] ratios to
more like $\sim$1:1). Clumps of material are often seen in nova ejecta
(e.g. Shara et al.\ 1997), and outflows of speeds around 2000\,km
s$^{-1}$ are not uncommon in novae (e.g. in nova LMC 1991; Schwartz
et al.\ 2001).

XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 was likely at its onset (in Oct 2005) a very
fast, Fe~{\sc ii} nova (Section~3 and Williams et al.\ 1991; Williams
et al.\ 1994). An accurate classification now however is not possible,
so late after maximum brightness. The soft ($kT_{\rm
  eff}$$\approx$60--70\,eV) X-ray spectrum indicates that the nova was
in a super-soft source (SSS) state (Krautter 2008) during its
discovery (in July 2006), and throughout its X-ray decline (by more
than two orders of magnitude) in the observations of Sept 2006, March
2007 and June 2007.  Such a state originates from nuclear burning on
the surface of the white dwarf, and measurements of the intensity,
duration, and temperature can be used to estimate the distance to the
nova and the mass of the white dwarf (e.g. Balman et al.\ 1998; Lanz
et al.\ 2005). Indeed, we believe (Section~4) that the white dwarf
within XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 may be quite massive
($>$1.2$M_{\odot}$).

As discussed earlier, classical novae are almost always discovered
optically in the early phases of their outbursts.
XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is very unusual therefore in that it has been
discovered first in X-rays. As such, it is useful to compare it with
XMMSL1~J070542.7-381442 (also known as V598 Pup; Read et al.\ 2008),
another nova recently discovered (in X-rays) in the XMM-Newton slew
survey. With a peak $m_{V}$ of $\ltsim12$, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is
not a particularly bright nova (c.f. V598 Pup, which reached an
m$_{V}$ of $\raisebox{-1mm}{$\stackrel{<}{\sim}$}$4), and so it is not surprising that it went
unnoticed, only being discovered in X-rays during the later (here
291\,days after the outburst), optically thin nebular phase, when
classical novae are typically observed as soft X-ray sources. Though
this delay should be taken as a upper limit, it is long when compared
to V598 Pup ($\raisebox{-1mm}{$\stackrel{<}{\sim}$}$127 days), but may instead be more similar to the
delays of $\sim$200 days seen in V1974 Cyg (Krautter et al.\ 1996),
$\sim$6 months of V382 Vel (Orio et al.\ 2002), and 6$-$8 months of
V1494 Aql (Drake et al.\ 2003). In their X-ray monitoring of optical
novae in M31, Pietsch et al.\ (2007) detect 11 out of 34 novae in
X-rays within a year after their optical outbursts. Seven novae are
seen to be X-ray bright, several (3$-$9) years after outburst, and
three novae showed very short X-ray outbursts, starting within
50\,days of outburst, but lasting only two to three months.
XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 therefore is not particularly unusual.

A method to estimate the distance to the nova is to use the relation
between the absolute magnitude at maximum brightness and the time that
the light curve takes to decline 2 magnitudes below maximum
brightness, $t_{2}$ (Della Valle \& Livio 1995). We have no
information over the 12 days between the data point of maximum
brightness and the lower limit prior to this (Fig.\,\ref{optlc}), and
therefore we have no exact outburst date, nor exact apparent
magnitude at outburst.  Assuming for the moment though that we have
caught the outburst exactly in the Sep.~30, 2005 observation, then we
can estimate (Sect.~5.3) $t_{2}$ to be 8$\pm$2\,days, and using this,
we can estimate (Della Valle \& Livio 1995) the absolute magnitude at
maximum brightness $M_{V}$ to be --8.7$\pm$0.6. An absolute magnitude
of $M_{V}$=--8.7 implies a peak luminosity $\sim$7 times the Eddington
luminosity for a 1\,$M_{\odot}$ white dwarf. This is quite typical of
novae.

With $A_{V}$=0.39$^{+0.05}_{-0.09}$ (90\% error), as derived (Predehl
\& Schmitt 1995) from $N_{\rm
  H}$=6.9$^{+1.0}_{-1.6}\times10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$ (from the highest
statistic spectral fit; the XMM-Newton ToO observation), and with
$M_{V}$=--8.7$\pm$0.6, and a peak $m_{V}$ of 12.0, we can derive a
distance to XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 of 115$^{+43}_{-30}$\,kpc.  As
discussed above however, we are unsure as to the exact outburst date
and the maximum brightness at outburst. Our assumed peak $m_{V}$ of
12.0 is almost certainly an underestimation. Although we have no
information in the 12 days prior to Sep.~30, 2005, a simple linear
extrapolation of the early October lightcurve back prior to Sep.~30,
2005 suggests that the actual peak $m_{V}$ was somewhere between 9 and
12. The corresponding distance estimates are then between 29 and
115\,kpc (with a mid-point $m_{V}$=10.5 value yielding a distance
estimate of 58\,kpc). Many methods have been used to estimate the
distance to the LMC (e.g.  Kovacs 2000, Nelson et al.\ 2000), but a
value of around 50\,kpc appears to be quite robust. Our distance
estimate is certainly consistent with that of the LMC, though the
errors are quite large.  It does appear to be the case however, that
our distance estimate places the source far outside of our own Galaxy.
This, together with the source's position on the sky (at the eastern
edge of the LMC) and the sizable ($\sim$Galactic) X-ray hydrogen
column densities obtained from the spectral fits, suggest strongly
that XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 lies within the LMC itself.  Note further
that the (pile-up corrected) spectral model normalizations to the
initial Slew discovery data (Sect.~2) also imply an approximate
distance to XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 of $\sim$50\,kpc.

The source had, at the time of the slew detection, an absorbed
(0.2$-$2\,keV) X-ray flux of 4.8$^{+2.7}_{-1.6}\times10^{-11}$\,ergs
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a 0.2$-$2\,keV X-ray luminosity
(at 50\,kpc) of 1.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\times10^{37}$\,ergs s$^{-1}$.
Assuming instead for the moment a distance more like 100\,kpc (though
this is thought to be well beyond the LMC, e.g. Kovacs 2000), then the
(0.2$-$2\,keV) X-ray luminosity of
5.7$^{+3.0}_{-1.9}\times$$10^{37}$\,erg s$^{-1}$ obtained is at the high end of the X-ray luminosities of
classical SSS-phase novae discussed e.g.\,in Orio et al.\ (2002) and
Ness et al.\ (2007). As discussed though, we have very likely missed
the outburst peak, and as such, our more probable assumed distance of
50\,kpc gives rise to a more typical SSS-phase X-ray luminosity.  The
luminosities of 7$-$8$\times$$10^{34}$\,erg s$^{-1}$, obtained during
the Swift and pointed XMM-Newton observations, are more typical of
novae at later times, when the emission can also sometimes be
described by a thermal plasma, rather than a black-body type spectrum,
or a more mixed spectrum, due to the complex structure of the ejecta
and the accretion disk (Krautter 2008, Shore 2008).


\section{Conclusions}

A bright X-ray source, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933, was detected in an
XMM-Newton slew on 18 July 2006 at a position where no previous X-ray
source had been seen. The XMM-Newton slew data, plus follow-up dedicated
XMM-Newton and Swift observations, plus optical imaging and
spectroscopic data acquired with the Magellan Clay telescope and 
All-Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) data were used to classify the new object
as a nova, and to examine its properties. The primary conclusions are
as follows:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item The soft X-ray spectrum indicates that the nova was in a
    super-soft source (SSS) state at its discovery in July 2007
    (XMM-Newton slew) and through its X-ray decline (by over two
    orders of magnitude) in September 2006 (XMM-Newton slew), March
    2007 (Swift) and June 2007 (XMM-Newton).

  \item The Magellan optical spectrum (Nov 2007) of the source
    indicates that it was very likely then a nova in the late
    A$_{0}$ auroral phase.

  \item The very fast optical decline (ASAS) during the nova's onset
    (Oct 2005), indicates that the initial nova was likely of speed class
    'very fast'.

  \item The very fast speed, together with the absolute magnitude at
    maximum brightness and the X-ray absorption, give rise to a
    distance to the source far beyond our own Galaxy. The large
    distance, together with the source's position in the sky, at the
    eastern edge of the LMC, and the spectral information from the
    X-ray data, are very suggestive that the nova is situated within
    the LMC itself.

  \item Analysis of XMM-Newton slew data is continuing to provide a
    powerful means of finding new X-ray transient objects.

We then present a discussion of the results (Section~6), and conclude with a Discussion of the Results ( Section~5) and a Discussion Of the Discussion (Section 6) The results of the Discussion are then presented in the Discussion and the Discussion. The Discussion and Discussion are the result of the discussions of theResults, the Discussion, the Results and the Conclusion. The results are the product of the analysis of the publicly available data from the XMM/Newton Slew Survey and the Swift X-Ray Multi-wavelength Multiwavelength Observations. The conclusions are based on the findings of the Swift observations and the observations from the Swift and X-MM/ newton surveys. The conclusion is based on a review of the literature on classical novae (see Bode & Evans 2008) e source    was not detected, and upper limits are shown in the table. The source is seen to have no cross-correlation identifications in the RASS database. No other multiwavelength candidates within 30\arcsecs were detected. A total of 229.source counts lie within a radius of 20\arc sec, yielding a (EPIC-pn:.0.2$-$2.keV) count rate of 23.4%. The source was seen again on 28th September 2004, apparently apparently from the same slews at the same position, 72 days after the original discovery. It has been detected over this region of sky a number of. times, though nothing was detected over the same region of the sky a. number of times, and nothing was found to be in the same place as the first time it was seen. The position of the source in the sky is such that it lies at the outer easternedge of the LMC.MC-XMM-Newton slew. It was discovered in XMM- newton slew 9121000003from revolution 1210 on 18th July 2006. Details of the standard. data reduction and analysis used are presented in the. standard. RASS catalogue. The slew spectrum, plus the best fit simple black body model and the deviations from the model, are shown in Fig. 1. All the errors quoted in the present paper are quoted with a 90% confidence interval. The best-fit reservoir column is equal to the full Galactic hydrogen column in the direction of the source. A background spectrum was extracted from amuch larger circular region close to the source and at a similar off-axis angle. The fit is good, with a 0.11, obtained via the XSPEC {\em goodness}command for this fit, based on 5000 random simulations. The more realistic the more complex the atmosphere, the better the fit to the model. The model was attempted to fit the nova model by MacDonald Vennes (1991), provided by Vennes et al. (1991) This model yielded amarginal fit (and not formally a significant fit) of 0.03,based on 5000random simulations, with an effective temperature of 70.2°C (70°F) The model is not valid when fitting spectra of low statistical quality, for the slew spectrum (and all the spectral fitting in thepresent paper), C-statistics have been used. Given. that we later are able to identify the source as a nova (Section~5), then the black-body model will likely be a good fit. The data points (crosses; adjacent data bins having a significance of at least 3) have been fitted with a black body model (kT=63\,eV; see text). The solid line shows the best fit to the spectrum. The ratio of the data to the best model is shown in the lower panel. The analysis has been performed using HEASOFTv6.1.2. The data points were stacked to ascertain a best Swift-XRT position $-$ this was found to be 06 06 37.9 (with a 90\% error radius of 4.0\arcsec). Source counts were then extracted from each observation from a circle of radius of 40/arcsec at this position. Source counts and. background count rates for the individual XRT observations are given in Table 7 in the report. The model normalizations, corrected for the removal of the saturated PSF core, can be used to derive an approximate distance to the source. All of the observations were in photoncounting mode and none of the. observations showed any times of significant high-BG flux. In none of. the observations did the source position coincide with any of the dead (micrometeorite-induced) columns. (see text) A spectrum was extracted from all the Swift-XRT data from a 40\arcsec\radius circle, using grades 0$-$12. The only simple model that was able to fit the dataadequately was a black-body model of temperature. The best-fit black body model is shown in Fig. 2. The source has faded by a factor of $>100$ since the XMM-Newton revolution 1210 slew discovery. A cautious estimate of the size of the emitting region can be obtained from the model. The model is possibly overestimating the luminosity, but this is consistent with that of moderately massive stars. Though great care should be taken in interpreting this result, this result should be interpreted as the result of the model being possibly overestimated, and not as a result of a massive massive star being emitting a massive luminosity. The data are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1. The solid lines show the best ratio of the spectra to the best model to fit to the data, and the dashed line shows the line line to the model that is most likely to have a significance of at least 3. The dashed line is the line that has the highest chance of fitting the best-fitting model to the Data. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 34,. 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49 Source spectra, containing single and double events, were extracted from the datasets from circles (none of the data were now piled up) An extraction radius, estimated from where the radial surface brightness profile was seen to fall to the surrounding background level, was set to 30\arcsec. This resulted in low-background MOS(pn) data. The only model that was able to fit the data well (a P-statistic = 0.17, based on 5000 random simulations) was a black-body model of temperature $kT$=70$^{+3}_{-4}$\,eV. The spectrum, together with this best-fit model, are shown in Fig. 2. The EPIC-pn data is shown in black, with EPic-MOS1 in red and EPIC -MOS2 in green. The solid lines show the best fit to the spectra. The ratios of theData to the best model are shown  in the lower panel of the Fig. 1 panel. The data points (crosses) have been grouped together for the plot to have a significance of at least 3 (P-statistics = no more than 0.04; P-and-a statistically significant fit = 0,0.04). The full (XMM-Newton slew plus Swift-XRT plus XMM- newton ToO) X-ray lightcurve of XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 is shown in Fig. 1. The calculated (0.2$-$2.0\,keV) flux values are shown plotted against the number of days since the discovery. The level of RASS upper limit is shown to the bottom left. No evidence for any short-term variability (using time bins down to 100\,s) is seen in the statistics. It may be the case that we are at this point at, or close to the end of the SSS phase, where the effective temperature has reached a maximum (Sala \& Hernanz 2005), and where the photospheric radius hasreached a minimum. The UVOT images were taken from the USNO-A2 optical/IR counterpart and the UVOT-UVW2 filters to be used in an exposure time ratio of 1:5, thus ensuring roughly equal numbers of counts in the two bands (though there is a spectral typedependency here). Swift UVOT. images in these two filters of the area around XM MSL1.2 -69 4933 are shown in. Fig. 2. Source counts were converted to UVOT UV-magnitudes using the UVW2 zero-point calibration released with version~2.8 of the CALDB. The source is seen to beroughly constant over the short duration of the Swift observations, with a suggestion of a decline towards the end. This is in keeping with the general form of the X-ray lightcurve. The situation is likely to be rather complex, depending on the structure of the ejecta and accretion disk, and is beyond the scope of the work we have yet to do. The best fit with a much lower temperature is a very poor fit to the data; we obtain a P-statistic value of 0.00, based on 5000 randomsimulations. This notwithstanding, a flux in theUVW2(1.57$-$7.77\,eV) band of 3.5$ is seen in the UVOT-detected flux. This flux is likely due to a combination of residual post-burning on the surface of the white dwarf, plus accretion accretion in the white disk, plus nuclear fuel on the planet's surface. We attempted to fit a single black-body spectrum to the Swift-XRT+UV data (again using C-statistics, the absorption model and the cosmic abundance table, plus the inclusion of the absorption component) On Nov.~13, 14, and 15, 2007, XMMSL1~J060636.2--694933 was observed with the Low--Dispersion Survey Spectrograph 3 (LDSS3) mounted on the Magellan Clay telescope. The Landolt (1992) magnitudes of the standards were converted to Sloan magnitudes. All the images were debiased and flatfielded using dome flatfield frames. We applied aperture photometry on each of the images using DAOPHOT in the National Optical Astronomy Observatories. We have also obtained spectroscopic observations using the VPH All grism, which has 660 lines per mm, and employing a mean dispersion of 2\AA\, sizeofper pixel. The spectra were biasand flatfield corrected, and extracted in \textsc{IRAF}. The Spectrophotometric flux.calibrators LTT 3218 (Nov. (~13), H600 ( Nov. (~14) and LTT 9293) were used to calibrate the flux around H$\alpha. Since there is no evidence for a difference in the $rprime$ images we attribute the difference to the fact that the source was not observed at the parallactic angle. The XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 was a nova, observed (in Nov 2007) in the late auroral phase. The decline from the brightest data point ($\approx$2.2 magnitudes in. 10 days, then a further $1.3 magnitude in 46 days) suggests that this is a noVA of the'very fast' speed class. The fact that the observed [OIII] lines are not. in the more usual, optically thin 3:1 ratio, can be explained in terms of a clumpy outflow scenario. Clumps of material are often seen in nova ejecta(e.g. Shara et al. 1997), around 2000\,km-s$^{-1} and outflows of speeds of speeds around 2000/1/2 km/s are not uncommon. The nova was likely at its onset (in Oct 2005) a veryfast, soft state (soft-S) X-ray spectrum indicates that it was a super-soft state (so late in its life that it could not be classified as a supernova). The source has since dimmed below the limiting magnitude of ASAS. We estimate that the time that the light curve takes to.decline 2 magnitudes below maximum observed brightness is 2 days (see Section~6). XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is not a particularly bright nova (c.f. V598 Pup) It is not surprising that it went unnoticed, only being discovered in X-rays during the later, optically thin nebular phase. We have no exact outburst date, nor exact apparent apparent magnitude at outburst. We are unsure as to the exact exact date of the maximum brightness at outburst, but assume it was somewhere between 9 and 12 days prior to Sep~30, 2005. The corresponding distance estimates are then between 29 and 29,115 kpc (with a mid-point of 29-115,000 kpc) The actual peak of the nova's lightcurve back prior to the early October 2005 suggests that the actual peak was somewhere around 9 and 9,115kpc. This is quite typical ofophobicnovae. Seven novae are seen to be X-ray bright, several (3$-$9) years after outburst, and three novae showed very short outbursts, starting within two to three months of outburst. The distance to XMMSl1~L1-L2-L3 is estimated from $6.9-9.9kpc (from the highest spectral fit; the XMM-Newton ToO observation) A bright X-ray source, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933, was detected in an XMM-Newton slew on 18 July 2006 at a position where no previous X-rays had been seen. The soft X-Ray spectrum indicates that the nova was in a super-soft source (SSS) state at its discovery in July 2007. The very fast optical decline (ASAS) during the initial nova's onset (Oct 2005) indicates that it was likely of speed class'very fast' The source is situated within the LMC, and the X- ray data are very suggestive that it is not a nova itself. It is also very likely that the source is in the late A$0 auroral phase of the Milky Way's history. The source's position in the sky, at the eastern edge of the L MC, is suggestive that nova is not in the galaxy itself. The nova appears to be in the early stages of its life, and may have been ejected from the galaxy at a point far beyond our own Galaxy. It has been identified as a 'novae' by the European Space Agency (ESO) and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. .                 ‘I’m sorry.’ ‘I didn’t mean to offend you’. ‘You’re a good person.‘ ‘We’ll try to do better next time.”... “I”m sorry I didn�’slammed you for being a bad person’, ‘you’ve got to be nicer to me’,. ‘"
Which air unit did Goodwin command during the initial landings of Marines on Saipan?,"Hugh Hilton Goodwin (December 21, 1900 – February 25, 1980) was a decorated officer in the United States Navy with the rank of Vice Admiral. A veteran of both World Wars, he commanded escort carrier  during the Mariana Islands campaign. Goodwin then served consecutively as Chief of Staff, Carrier Strike Group 6 and as Air Officer, Philippine Sea Frontier and participated in the Philippines campaign in the later part of the War.

Following the War, he remained in the Navy and rose to the flag rank and held several important commands including Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service, Commander, Carrier Division Two and Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command.

Early life and career

Hugh H. Goodwin was born on December 21, 1900, in Monroe, Louisiana and attended Monroe High School there (now Neville High School). Following the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, Goodwin left the school without receiving the diploma in order to see some combat and enlisted the United States Navy on May 7, 1917. He completed basic training and was assigned to the battleship . Goodwin participated in the training of armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war and in November 1917, he sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea.

Although he did not complete the last year of high school, Goodwin was able to earn an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918. While at the academy, he earned a nickname ""Huge"" and among his classmates were several future admirals and generals including: Hyman G. Rickover, Milton E. Miles, Robert E. Blick Jr., Herbert S. Duckworth, Clayton C. Jerome, James P. Riseley, James A. Stuart, Frank Peak Akers, Sherman Clark, Raymond P. Coffman, Delbert S. Cornwell, Frederick J. Eckhoff, Ralph B. DeWitt, John Higgins, Vernon Huber, Albert K. Morehouse, Harold F. Pullen, Michael J. Malanaphy, William S. Parsons, Harold R. Stevens, John P. Whitney, Lyman G. Miller and George J. O'Shea.

Goodwin graduated with Bachelor of Science degree on June 3, 1922, and was commissioned Ensign in the United States Navy. He was subsequently assigned to the battleship  and took part in the voyage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before he was ordered to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island for submarine instruction in June 1923. Goodwin completed the training several weeks later and was attached to the submarine . He then continued his further training aboard submarine  and following his promotion to Lieutenant (junior grade) on June 3, 1925, he qualified as submariner.

He then served aboard submarine  off the coast of California, before he was ordered for the recruiting duty to San Francisco in September 1927. While in this capacity, Goodwin applied for naval aviation training which was ultimately approved and he was ordered to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in August 1928. Toward the end of the training, he was promoted to lieutenant on December 11, 1928, and upon the completion of the training in January 1929, he was designated Naval aviator.

Goodwin was subsequently attached to the Observation Squadron aboard the aircraft carrier  and participated in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean. He was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. in August 1931 and served consecutively under the architect of naval aviation William A. Moffett and future Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King.

In June 1933, Goodwin was ordered to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, where he completed junior course in May of the following year. He subsequently joined the crew of aircraft carrier  and served under Captain Arthur B. Cook and took part in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States.

He was ordered back to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in June 1936 and was attached to the staff of the Base Commandant, then-Captain Charles A. Blakely. When Blakely was succeeded by William F. Halsey in June 1937, Goodwin remained in Halsey's staff and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on December 1, 1937. He also completed correspondence course in International law at the Naval War College.

Goodwin was appointed Commanding officer of the Observation Squadron 1 in June 1938 and attached to the battleship  he took part in the patrolling of the Pacific and 
West Coast of the United States until September 1938, when he assumed command of the Observation Squadron 2 attached to the battleship .

When his old superior from Lexington, now Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, was appointed Commander Aircraft, Scouting Force in June 1939, he requested Goodwin as his Aide and Flag Secretary. He became Admiral Cook's protégé and after year and half of service in the Pacific, he continued as his Aide and Flag Secretary, when Cook was appointed Commander Aircraft, Atlantic Fleet in November 1940.

World War II

Following the United States' entry into World War II, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Commander on January 1, 1942, and assumed duty as advisor to the Argentine Navy. His promotion was made permanent two months later and he returned to the United States in early 1943 for duty as assistant director of Planning in the Bureau of Aeronautics under Rear admiral John S. McCain. While still in Argentina, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Captain on June 21, 1942.

By the end of December 1943, Goodwin was ordered to Astoria, Oregon, where he assumed command of newly commissioned escort carrier USS Gambier Bay. He was responsible for the initial training of the crew and was known as a strict disciplinarian, but the crew appreciated the skills he taught them that prepared them for combat. Goodwin insisted that everyone aboard has to do every job right every time and made us fight our ship at her best.

During the first half of 1944, Gambier Bay was tasked with ferrying aircraft for repairs and qualified carrier pilots from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before departed on May 1, 1944, to join Rear admiral Harold B. Sallada's Carrier Support Group 2, staging in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas.

The air unit, VC-10 Squadron, under Goodwin's command gave close air support to the initial landings of Marines on Saipan on June 15, 1944, destroying enemy gun emplacements, troops, tanks, and trucks. On the 17th, her combat air patrol (CAP) shot down or turned back all but a handful of 47 enemy planes headed for her task group and her gunners shot down two of the three planes that did break through to attack her.

Goodwin's carrier continued in providing of close ground support operations at Tinian during the end of July 1944, then turned her attention to Guam, where she gave identical aid to invading troops until mid-August that year. For his service during the Mariana Islands campaign, Goodwin was decorated with Bronze Star Medal with Combat ""V"".

He was succeeded by Captain Walter V. R. Vieweg on August 18, 1944, and appointed Chief of Staff, Carrier Division Six under Rear admiral Arthur W. Radford. The Gambier Bay was sunk in the Battle off Samar on October 25, 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf after helping turn back a much larger attacking Japanese surface force.

Goodwin served with Carrier Division Six during the Bonin Islands raids, the naval operations at Palau and took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and operations supporting Leyte landings in late 1944. He was later appointed Air Officer of the Philippine Sea Frontier under Rear admiral James L. Kauffman and remained with that command until the end of hostilities. For his service in the later part of World War II, Goodwin was decorated with Legion of Merit with Combat ""V"". He was also entitled to wear two Navy Presidential Unit Citations and Navy Unit Commendation.

Postwar service

Following the surrender of Japan, Goodwin assumed command of Light aircraft carrier  on August 24, 1945. The ship was tasked with air missions over Japan became mercy flights over Allied prisoner-of-war camps, dropping food and medicine until the men could be rescued. She was also present at Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945.

Goodwin returned with San Jacinto to the United States in mid-September 1945 and he was detached in January 1946. He subsequently served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations until May that year, when he entered the instruction at National War College. Goodwin graduated in June 1947 and served on Secretary's committee for Research on Reorganization. Upon promotion to Rear admiral on April 1, 1949, Goodwin was appointed Chief of Staff and Aide to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet under Admiral William H. P. Blandy.

Revolt of the Admirals

In April 1949, the budget's cuts and proposed reorganization of the United States Armed Forces by the Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson launched the wave of discontent between senior commanders in the United States Navy. Johnson proposed the merging of the Marine Corps into the Army, and reduce the Navy to a convoy-escort force.

Goodwin's superior officer, Admiral Blandy was call to testify before the House Committee on Armed Services and his harsh statements for the defense of the Navy, costed him his career. Goodwin shared his views and openly criticized Secretary Johnson for having power concentrated in a single civilian executive, who is an appointee of the Government and not an elected representative of the people. He also criticized aspects of defense unification which permitted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to vote on arms policies of individual services, and thus ""rob"" the branches of autonomy.

The outbreak of the Korean War in summer 1950 proved the proposal of Secretary Johnson as incorrect and he resigned in September that year. Also Secretary of the Navy, Francis P. Matthews resigned one month earlier.

Later service

Due to the Revolts of the admirals, Blandy was forced to retire in February 1950 and Goodwin was ordered to Newport, Rhode Island for temporary duty as Chief of Staff and Aide to the President of the Naval War College under Vice admiral Donald B. Beary in April 1950. Goodwin was detached from that assignment two months and appointed member of the General Board of the Navy. He was shortly thereafter appointed acting Navy Chief of Public Information, as the substitute for Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey, who was relieved of illness, but returned to the General Board of the Navy in July that year. Goodwin served in that capacity until February 1951, when he relieved his Academy class, Rear admiral John P. Whitney as Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service (MATS).

While in this capacity, Goodwin served under Lieutenant general Laurence S. Kuter and was co-responsible for the logistical support of United Nations troops fighting in Korea. The MATS operated from the United States to Japan and Goodwin served in this capacity until August 1953, when he was appointed Commander Carrier Division Two. While in this assignment, he took part in the Operation Mariner, Joint Anglo-American exercise which encountered very heavy seas over a two-week period in fall 1953.

Goodwin was ordered to the Philippines in May 1954 and assumed duty as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines with headquarters at Naval Station Sangley Point near Cavite. He held that command in the period of tensions between Taiwan and China and publicly declared shortly after his arrival, that any attack on Taiwan by the Chinese Communists on the mainland would result in US participation in the conflict. The naval fighter planes under his command also provided escort for passing commercial planes. Goodwin worked together with retired Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, then-Ambassador to the Philippines, and accompanied him during the visits to Singapore, Bangkok and Saigon in January 1955.

On December 18, 1955, Goodwin's classmate Rear admiral Albert K. Morehouse, then serving as Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), died of heart attack and Goodwin was ordered to CONAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado to assume Morehouse's position. While in this capacity, he was subordinated to Army General Earle E. Partridge and was responsible for the Naval and Marine Forces allocated to the command designated for the defense of the Continental United States.

Retirement

Goodwin retired on June 1, 1957, after 40 years of active service and was advanced to the rank of Vice admiral on the retired list for having been specially commended in combat. A week later, he was invited back to his Monroe High School (now Neville High School) and handed a diploma showing that he had been graduated with the class of 1918. He then settled in Monterey, California where he taught American history at Stevenson school and was a member of the Naval Order of the United States.

Vice admiral Hugh H. Goodwin died at his home on February 25, 1980, aged 79. He was survived by his wife, Eleanor with whom he had two children, a daughter Sidney and a son Hugh Jr., who graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1948, but died one year later, when the Hellcat fighter he was piloting collided with another over the Gulf of Mexico during training.

Figure 1: Just by looking at subfigure (a), we, as humans, can easily perceive a shape like the one in subfigure (b).This is an extraordinary capability of our human brain and in this paper, we tried to see whether convolutional neural networks can show such capabilities.
Figure 2: The trajectory from random noise X N to the incomplete image X I in image space.The network will pass a completed version of the image, X C , throughout this trajectory.
Figure 4: This figure shows our iterative process to complete the fragmented contours of an image given as input to our pipeline.
Figure 5: This example shows how different scores change throughout a single run.All three scores change in the range of [0, 100].Our goal is to maximize reconstruction_score and minimize the overfit_score, but we should consider that the minimization lower bound is data dependent and is not zero.
Figure 6: Evolutionary process of the deep structure prior.The right column shows the incomplete shapes given to the model and the rest of the columns show how the model is overfitting gradually to produce the incomplete shapes.In each column, we are showing an intermediate iteration of this process.The loss-term setup enables our pipeline to let the completed image appears during this iterative process.
Average MSE and IoU values between the incomplete (Raw) images, the output of DIP and DSP methods, and ground truth for each image are provided in this table.
For this experiment, we ran the model over a subset of complex dataset with 500 incomplete images at various levels of alpha for 250 iterations.After the image completion is done, we compared the evaluation metrics between the completed image and the ground truth to examine the performance of the model for different values of alpha.
In this table, we show the effect of the receptive filter size on our algorithm's capability to fill in bigger gap sizes.The numbers in this table are showing the percentage of the time that DIP was successful to complete shapes with each gap size and corresponding receptive field size.As predicted, the bigger the filter size, the more successful the algorithm is in filling in the gaps.

abstract

Humans can easily perceive illusory contours and complete missing forms in fragmented shapes. This work investigates whether such capability can arise in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using deep structural priors computed directly from images. In this work, we present a framework that completes disconnected contours and connects fragmented lines and curves.
In our framework, we propose a model that does not even need to know which regions of the contour are eliminated. We introduce an iterative process that completes an incomplete image and we propose novel measures that guide this to find regions it needs to complete. Our model trains on a single image and fills in the contours with no additional training data.
Our work builds a robust framework to achieve contour completion using deep structural priors and extensively investigate how such a model could be implemented.

Introduction

The human visual system is used to seeing incomplete outlines. Our brains can effortlessly group visual elements and fragmented contours that seem to be connected to each other. This power enables us to make shapes, organize disconnected visual features, and even properties of 3D surfaces when projected on 2D planes.
demonstrated how early vision may quickly complete partially-occluded objects using monocular signals. This capability of perceptual grouping has been studied in vision science for decades . Although there has been some work on perceptual grouping in the past couple of years, it has been less studied in the past decade due to the enormous progress of deep neural networks and their success in dealing with the pixel-by-pixel inference of images.
Different types of lines and curves have been studied to maximize the connectivity of two broken ends in the planer contour completion problem . Different types of lines and curves have been studied to maximize the connectivity of two broken ends in the planer contour completion problem. Geometry-based constraints can be utilized to address some challenges of contour completion problems, such as smoothness and curvature consistency .
However, such approaches only work for simple, smooth contours and usually fail in more complex settings. On the other hand, we currently have deep models that could easily take an incomplete image and complete the missing regions using enough training data . The amazing capability of such models especially those that are trained on different modalities with millions or billions of training data raises the question of whether we need such a large amount of training to perceive all the visual cues that are present in an image, which underlies visual perception by humans.
In human vision, Gestalt psychology suggests that our brain is designed to perceive structures and patterns that are grouped by some known rules. In this work, we show that some perceptual structures can also be learned from the image itself directly using architectures that enable such learning. Earlier work has shown  This is an extraordinary capability of our human brain and in this paper, we tried to see whether convolutional neural networks can show such capabilities.
that some forms of perceptual grouping can be achieved using computational models, such as stochastic completion fields . This type of learning resonates with some of the Gestalt perceptual grouping principles including ""proximity"", ""good continuation"" and ""similarity"". In scenarios where color and/or texture are present, the cue of ""similarity"" helps us group regions with consistent patterns .
When color and texture are present, they provide a collection of rich information for such cues. In the present article, we probe convolutional neural networks in a scenario where both are absent, and the neural network is dealing with just forms and shapes. Specifically, we explore whether the convolutional neural network architecture itself can give rise to some of these grouping cues when they are fed just contours and shapes alone.
For years, neural networks have been treated as black boxes that can generalize images very well to multiple classes when there are enough training exemplars. One of the reasons that neural networks are trained on many exemplars is to avoid the problem of overfitting. On the other hand, we know that CNNs that generalize well to large classes of exemplars can easily overfit when those class labels are randomly permuted .
Inspired by this observation, suggest that image priors can be learned to a large extent through a generator network architecture that is solely trained on a single image. This encouraged us to take a deeper look at what structural information can be learned from a single-shape image and whether we can reconstruct some of those perceptual grouping capabilities using a generator network.
Inspired by , in this work, we adopt a novel training regime to complete shapes and contours where we use a UNet architecture with random initial weights and try to complete the contours within a single image without any training data. In our model, we imagine that the input image (i.e., the only image used to update the model's weights) is an image of fragmented contours.
In this work, instead of training the model on multiple images fetched from a big image dataset, we imagine a random fixed tensor noise image as input to this model. At each iteration, the random noise tensor is inferred through our generative network and the network produces an outcome image. We introduce a novel loss function that enables this network to complete contours.
This process repeats, and the weights of our network are updated gradually based on this loss function, which is an energy term defined based on the input image and the output of the network. The model will reconstruct the missing structures i.e., group fragmented contours that perceptually seem to be connected, before it fully overfits to the incomplete input image.
Contributions of our work are summarized as follows: 1. In our pipeline, we propose a novel algorithm that enables us to complete contours that appear to be connected to each other in an illusory form. 2. Our model is trained on just one single query image and does not need any training data. 3. Our model does not need to know which regions of the image are masked or occluded, i.e., we remove the dependency of the algorithm on the guiding mask (a guiding mask is a mask that informs the model on where the missing regions are located at).
We also introduce two metrics to produce a stopping criterion to know when to stop training before the model fully overfits to the incomplete image, i.e., we guide the model to stop when the completed image is produced.

Methods

Our eyes are trained to predict a missing region of an occluded object within a scene. We can easily perceive or make guesses about parts of objects or shapes that we do not necessarily see. Even when we are looking at an image, we might guess about the shape, property, or other attributes of an unknown object within a scene.
Such capability extends beyond just known objects or shapes. We can look at a disconnected set of contours and guess what the connected form may look like. This capability is rooted in our prior knowledge about the world. (see Figure ). In this work, we aim to achieve a similar capability using deep generative networks.
Most neural networks that we work with these days are trained with a massive amount of data and one might think that this is the only way that a neural network can obtain prior information. Authors of Deep Image Prior (DIP) suggest that the convolutional architecture can capture a fair amount of information about image distribution.
They show that the hourglass architectures like UNet can show some good performances in some inverse problems such as image denoising, super-resolution, and inpainting. In this work, we focus on completing fragmented contours end-to-end just by using a single image. To be able to address this problem, we first look at a similar problem in image editing, known as image inpainting.
Image inpainting is the task of completing an image where some regions of that image are covered or filtered by a mask. In image inpainting, the generative model receives a masked image with the mask that guides the algorithm to fill in those missing regions. Although in the problem of contour completion, we have a very similar goal, the additional challenge that we suffer from is that we do not necessarily have a mask that covers the regions of interest for us.
For example, when we look at Figure (left), we are not provided that which regions of the image are incomplete by a guiding mask. Our brain figures this out just by looking at the form and predicting those missing regions. Inspired by the image inpainting work of DIP , we propose a novel algorithm for the contour completion problem (see Figure ), where, unlike DIP, we do not have a guiding mask to know where to fill in the missing regions of our disconnected contours.
Let us assume that we are given a degraded image x I containing a fragmented contour. We propose an iterative process (see Figure ) that can connect those discontinuities and glue those fragmented pieces together as follows. We propose an hour-glass model structure (f ) that is initially set up with completely random parameters (θ 0 ) at first.
Through an iterative process, we start feeding our network with a fixed random tensor noise z signal and obtain the inferred output (f (z)) from that network. We then back-propagate the difference between the inferred output and the incomplete image to the network. We then repeat this process until the difference between the generated outcome of the network (f θ (z)) and the incomplete image (x I ) gets smaller and smaller and finally overfits the incomplete image (x I ).
In this work, we propose a novel error metric to backpropagate in the model and update its weights. we set the metric in a way that enables us to complete the incomplete image before it overfits the incomplete image. This is where the magic of our algorithm happens. We also propose a stopping criterion, so that when the image is complete, we no longer overfit the outcome of the model and instead produce a plausible connected set of fragmented contour pieces.
As illustrated in Figure , this trajectory will pass through a complete version of the image in image space, which is close to the actual connected ground truth x gt , which we do not have access to directly.

Energy Function

We can model this iterative process mathematically by maximizing a posterior distribution. Let us assume that the optimal image x * that we want to achieve is on a path that connects a random tensor noise z to the incomplete image x I . With this assumption, we can eventually overfit any random tensor noise to the incomplete image x I , and we can formulate the posterior distribution of our wanted optimal image x * as follows:
No Prior To better recapitulate what we want to achieve using our generative model, we solve an energy minimization problem on the parameter space of the model, rather than explicitly working with probability distributions and optimizing on x (image space). Thus, we solve an energy minimization problem that incorporates the incomplete image (x I ) and model parameters (f θ (z)):
As shown in Figure , the pipeline starts from a random initialized set of parameters θ and updates those weights until it reaches a local minimum θ * . The only information provided for the network is the incomplete image x I . When we reach the optimal θ * , the completed image is obtained as x * = f θ * (z) where z is random tensor noise.
In this work, we use a U-Net architecture with skip connections as the generator model. "" As we mentioned previously, in this work we were inspired by an earlier work known as Deep Image Prior (DIP) . In this work, the authors suggested a mean-squared-error loss term that enables the network to compare the output of the generator to the incomplete input image:
where x I is the incomplete image with missing pixels in correspondence of a binary mask m ∈ {0, 1} H×W and operator is for point-wise multiplication of two image matrices. In the inpainting tasks, the existence of a mask is essential as the algorithm needs to know where to fill in the missing area, whereas, in our work, we wanted to know whether the network can perform completion on its own without the need for the mask.
In other words, is it possible for the network to predict where to fill in at the same time that it is trying to reconstruct the incomplete image through the iterative process? To answer this question, we tried to solve a much harder problem in which the mask is not provided to the model and the model is agnostic to it.
To better understand how a solution could be hypothesized for this problem, we first imagine that we want to consider all the available regions in our image that could be potential places to fill in, i.e., we set the mask in the previous formula 1 to be equal to the incomplete image x I . This is problematic as the model quickly tries to fill in all white space and quickly reconstructs the incomplete image by doing so.
On the other hand, we can take the inverse problem of the current problem, where the model tries to just fill in the regions that fragmented contour lives in. Taking these two at the same time, we came up with a novel loss term for energy minimization term that helps us remove the need for the mask in the case of the contour completion problem:
In this term, we introduce a linear combination of the two loss terms, where one focuses on reconstructing the missing regions in the foreground, and one focuses on avoiding inpainting regions in the background. The logic behind this is that, if we assume the original image to be representative of the mask, then the model tries to reconstruct in all white regions (the foreground), and in the inverse problem we just want to reconstruct the regions that are already part of the ground truth.

Stopping Criteria

As shown in Figure , knowing when to stop iterating to the over-fitted model is a key to obtaining a completed shape. Therefore, we equipped our model with a criterion that uses two individual novel terms to know when to stop and output the result of the network. These two metrics expand the capability of the generator network beyond what it does currently and achieve a full end-to-end contour completion model that trains and infers on a single image of divided contour fragments.
These new terms are: reconstruction_score (ρ) and overfit_score (ω).

Reconstruction Score

The first score that this paper suggests is the reconstruction score, i. e., we have to make sure that the model is trained enough that it can reconstruct at least the entire set of fragmented contours within the image. This is a trivial score and to compute the reconstruction_score (ρ), we apply a k-dimensional tree (KDTree) nearest-neighbor lookup to find the ratio of points in the original incomplete image (x 0 ).
This score ranges from [0 − 100].

Overfit Score

It is evident that the model overfits the fragmented contours. This is due to the fact that the error in our loss term is minimized as the x overfits to x I , i. e., replacing x with x I in the loss term would give us zero. As we hypothesize iterative process also produces the complete image before it overfits to the incomplete image, we can imagine that at some point the image is complete (x C ) and does not need to be fine-tuned any more to overfit to x I .
We suggest a new score called overfit_score. overfit_score determines how much of the reconstructed outcome is over the number of pixels that are already in the incomplete image (x I ). To compute the overfit_score (ω), we apply a k-dimensional tree (KDTree) nearest-neighbor lookup of points in the outcome of the input image and see what portions of those points are novel and not already in the incomplete image (x I ).
Similar to reconstruction_score, the overfit_score also ranges from [0 − 100]. Our goal is to maximize reconstruction_score and minimize the overfit_score, but we should consider that the minimization lower bound is data dependent and is not zero.

Combined Score

To be able to find the best possible set of completed contours, we combine the two and have a loop that tries to achieve close to full reconstruction and avoids over-fitting at the same time. This is what we call an ""ideal"" stopping point in the contour completion problem. In each run throughout all iterations, we pick an output of the network that minimizes a dissimilarity term:
where δ represents our dissimilarity score. The reconstruction_score and overfit_score are obtainable given network output and the incomplete image. Ideally, we want to achieve an output image that has a reconstruction_score equal to 100 and an overfit_score of γ which is a hyperparameter that is dependent on the image and complexity of the shape.
Empirically, we observed that this value is highly correlated with the distance between gaps that are observed in fragmented contours, i. e., the larger the gap results in a larger γ value. We will discuss this in more detail in the next section (see Section 3). For one sample image, we computed the two metrics reconstruction_score and overfit_score and the combined value of dissimilarity (δ) and showed how these values change (see Figure ).
Our initial observations show that the reconstruction_score will increase to 100 quickly for the incomplete image indicating that the already existing fragments of the contours have been reconstructed in the output. However, as mentioned previously, we cannot solely rely on this score since we also want to minimize the overfitting.
Remember that our goal is to produce an output that: a) preserves the original contours in the incomplete image and b) fills in the gaps between the fragmented contours. It is evident that overfit_score decreases throughout an iterative run of our process until it reaches zero. The dissimilarity will also decrease along with the overfit to a point, then it will increase, as the model tries to reproduce the incomplete image.
This is where an ideal γ value can be picked, i.e., where to stop when the reconstruction is good but we have not done a full overfit to the incomplete image. Thus, one should pick the value of γ empirically in the scenario that the ground truth is not available, whereas, assuming that the ground truth is available, we can easily compute the best γ value.
In our experiments, we tried two datasets of images with different gap sizes. We observed that the best the γ for one set of samples is ∼ 5 (the set with shorter gaps) while it is ∼ 23 for samples from the other set, i. e, the set with longer gaps (see Figure for some completed examples).

Experiments and Results

Performing unsupervised contour completion is a difficult task to benchmark as one can never know what fragments exactly are connected to each other in a real-world scenario. This makes the problem of contour completion a hard problem to solve. In this paper, we tried to create artificial shapes that are occluded by some masks and then tried to see if our model can regenerate the missing pieces and glue those divided contours together.
To demonstrate our model's behavior, we will conduct experiments on datasets created for this task and will report on them in this section. To compare network results in different settings, we will use pixel-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Intersection over Union (IoU) between the produced result of the network and unmasked ground truth data and the reconstructed image on black pixels (where contours live).

Data

We prepared two datasets, one labeled ""Simple"" and one ""Complex"", in accordance with the number of gaps in each shape. Both datasets contain nine different categories of shapes. In order to generate the Complex dataset, we used FlatShapeNet which is a dataset for the educational game Ariga. The dataset includes the following categories: Circle, Kite, Parallelogram, Rectangle, Rhombus, Square, Trapezoid, Triangle and Overlap.
The ""overlap"" category contains images that are made as a mixture of two shapes that are overlapping from the previous categories. These are some standard shapes with a few gaps in simple dataset, while the complex dataset has some hand-drawn shapes with fragmented lines and more gaps that produce more variety in general.
For each instance, a ground truth image is available for comparison. Most of our experiments have been conducted using the complex dataset in order to evaluate the generalization of our approach. For the analysis of how γ values should be set for each shape, we used the simple dataset as a reference.

Evaluation

In this section, we compare our model to the original Deep Image Prior (DIP) inpainting model. DIP's inpainting module accepts a degraded image and a binary mask corresponding to that image. In order to make a fair comparison, instead of providing a binary mask, we used the incomplete images both as input and as a mask in order to see whether it can produce a result similar to ours.
For DIP, we run the iterative process for a maximum number of 2500 iterations with the U-net backbone. We used the exact same architecture and setting in our model for a fair comparison. Using our ground truth dataset images, we calculate the MSE loss between the network output and ground truth during each iteration instead of relying on our stopping mechanism described in the previous section.
We then store the output with minimal loss throughout all the iterations. Finally, we select the best output among all iterations, report the MSE and IoU with the ground truth, and save the iteration number which resulted in the lowest MSE. Table compares the results that are obtained using the DIP method, the DSP method (ours), and the difference between raw images and the ground truth.
We have presented the average MSE-loss, average IoU, and the average number of iterations for the best output for different methods. As can be seen from the table, our model improves both MSE and IoU between the incomplete image and ground truth in fewer iterations. The DIP method can neither generate a better result than the raw image nor provide stopping criteria to prevent overfitting.
We provide a more detailed analysis of this result in Figure . As results show, our algorithm not only provides a much faster convergence but also consistently provides a better-completed image (consistently less MSE loss and better IoU), whereas it is challenging for the DIP method to accomplish better results without a guiding mask.
We compare MSE loss between the degraded raw images that these algorithms started with (shown in blue) (a) Mean Squared Error Loss: we clearly see that for almost all images, DSP (green) achieves a lower MSE than the incomplete images (blue) whereas, the DIP completed images either do not improve the MSE or even worsen that for the incomplete images.
Note that, the MSE is computed to an available ground truth image hidden from our methods (the lower is better). (b) Intersection Over Union: here, we are looking at the IoU metric that specifies the amount of intersection over the union between the obtained images and the ground truth data. Again, we see that DSP produces images that are much closer to the ground truth (in most cases) whereas the DIP can not achieve a similar result.
While we see few DIP completed images produce a better IoU than the degraded images (in terms of IoU), most of them are worse than the starting image (the higher is better). (c) The number of iterations that are needed for each algorithm to obtain its best results. Here, we see that DSP can quickly produce the best outcome with the least MSE loss whereas the DIP algorithm's best results are when we run the iterative process for more iterations (the lower is better).

Correlation of γ with the Gap Size

To better understand the γ parameter of our combined score, we conducted the following experiment. A total of 12000 samples were obtained by merging all of our images from the two datasets, simple and complex. As we have access to the ground truth for each degraded image in the combined dataset, we can easily calculate reconstruction_score and overfit_score for each degraded-ground truth pair.
As expected, we obtain a reconstruction_score of 100 for all samples, but the overfit_score varies among them. Intuitively, we hypothesized that an optimal value of overfit score should be intertwined with the total area of gaps. To test this hypothesis, we did the following experiment. We first define a function φ(x) which takes a binary, black and white image x and returns the number of black pixels in it.
Then we define a gap term as follows: where x I is the incomplete image and x gt is the ground truth. In this case, gap indicates the total area of the gap with respect to the whole shape. We found out that this term and the best result have a correlation of 97.43%. This indicates that the value of γ is highly correlated with the gap size, that is something expected in a way.

Effect of α

We conducted additional experiments concerning how α affects the quality of reconstruction. In the previous section, we defined Equation 2 as the loss term that guides our iterative process. The term α specifies the amount of emphasis the model should place on reconstructing missing regions, rather than filling in fragmented contours.
A lower α indicates a better grouping quality, as shown in Equation . However, we will not achieve completion if we remove the first term completely from the loss by setting α = 0. Therefore, the first term should be kept, but its weight should be very low in order to achieve a good completion. On the other hand, if we set α = 1 and omit the second term, we lose the contour completion regularization term and obtain the same output as a vanilla deep image prior, which does not complete shapes.

Effect of Receptive Field Size

To better understand the effect of receptive field size on our algorithm, we test the following hypothesis: can models with bigger receptive field size complete shapes with bigger gaps? In Table , we report showing the results of this experiment. As we can see, the bigger the receptive field size, the more complete shapes we can reconstruct using DSP.

Implementation Details

As shown in Figure , we use a model with 5 layers and 128 channels for downsampling and upsampling convolutions, and 64 channels for skip convolutions. The upsampling and downsampling modules use 3 × 3 filters, while the skip module uses 1 × 1 filters. In the upsample part of the network, the nearest neighbor algorithm is used.
We used 256 × 256 images with three channels in all of our experiments. In training, we use the MSE loss between the degraded image and the output of the network, and we optimize the loss using the ADAM optimizer and a learning rate equal to 0.01 . In our experiments, we also used α = 0.15 as an optimal proportion coefficient for reconstruction loss.

Conclusion

In this work, we introduced a novel framework for contour completion using deep structure priors (DSP). This work offers a novel notion of a maskless grouping of fragmented contours. In our proposed framework, we introduced a novel loss metric that does not require a strict definition of the mask. Instead, it lets the model learn the perceivable illusory contours and connects those fragmented pieces using a generator network that is solely trained on just the single incomplete input image.
Our model does not require any pre-training which demonstrates that the convolutional architecture of the hour-glass model is able to connect disconnected contours. We present an extended set of experiments that show the capability of our algorithm. We investigate the effect of each parameter introduced in our algorithm separately and show how one could possibly achieve the best result for their problem using this model.
In future work, we plan to extend this model and try to see how it performs with real images. In particular, we want to determine whether we can inpaint real-world photographs while retaining perceptually aware scene structures. The importance of shape in perception by deep neural networks has been highlighted in many adversarial examples to appearance-based networks .
The outcome of this work has strong potential to impact the designing and implementation of models that are robust to such perturbations.",['Bigger receptive field size leads to more successful shape completion.'],5241,multifieldqa_en,en,,4ad542cf320f1c01a4bce92a59628789784cf9722d7d476c," Humans can easily perceive illusory contours and complete missing forms in fragmented shapes. This work investigates whether such capability can arise in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using deep structural priors computed directly from images. In this work, we present a framework that completes disconnected contour and connects fragmented lines and curves. We propose a model that does not even need to know which regions of the contour are eliminated. We introduce an iterative process that completes an incomplete image and we propose novel measures that guide this to find regions it needs to complete. Our model trains on a single image and fills in the contours with no additional training data. We ran the model over a subset of complex dataset with 500 incomplete images at various levels of alpha for 250 iterations. After the image completion is done, we compared the evaluation metrics between the completed image and the ground truth to examine the performance of the model for different values of alpha. We show the effect of the receptive filter size on our algorithm's capability to fill in bigger gap sizes. ealing with the pixel-by-pixel inference of images. Gestalt psychology suggests that our brain is designed to perceive structures and patterns that are grouped by some known rules. We explore whether the convolutional neural network architecture itself can give rise to some of these grouping cues when they are fed just contours and shapes alone. In our model, we imagine that the input image (i.e., the only image used to update the model's weights) is an image of fragmented contours. This type of learning resonates with some of the Gestalt perceptual grouping principles including ""proximity"", ""good continuation"" and ""similarity"". In scenarios where color and/or texture are present, the cue of "" similarity"" helps us group regions with consistent patterns.

In our pipeline, we propose a novel algorithm that enables us to complete contours that appear to be connected to each other in an illusory form. Our model is trained on just one single query image and does not need any training data. We also introduce two metrics to produce a stopping criterion to know when to stop training before the model fully overfits to the incomplete image. We propose an hour-glass model structure (f ) that is initially set up with completely random parameters (θ 0 ) at first.Through an iterative process, we start feeding our network with a fixed random tensor noise z signal and obtain the inferred output (f (z) from that network. The model will reconstruct the missing structures i.e., group fragmented contour that perceptually seem to beconnected, before it fully overfit to the missing input image. The models are updated gradually based on this loss function, which is an energy term defined based on the input image and the output of the network. In this work, we focus on completing fragmented contours end-to-end just by using a single image. Inpainting tasks, the existence of a mask is essential as the algorithm needs to know where to fill in the missing area. In our work, we wanted to know whether the network can perform completion on its own without the need for the mask. To answer this question, we tried to solve a much harder problem in which the mask is not provided to the model and the model is agnostic to it. The pipeline starts from a random set of parameters and updates those weights until it reaches a local minimum. The only information provided for the network is the incomplete image x I. When we reach the optimal  *, the completed image is obtained as x * = f θ * (z) where z is random tensor noise. We also propose a stopping criterion, so that when the image is complete, we no longer overfit the outcome of the model. We introduce a novel loss term for energy minimization term that helps us remove the need of the mask in the case of the contour completion problem: o gt (f) (z). Knowing when to stop iterating to the over-fitted model is a key to obtaining a completed shape. We equipped our model with a criterion that uses two individual novel terms. These two metrics expand the capability of the generator network beyond what it does currently and achieve a full end-to-end contour completion model. We will discuss this in more detail in the next section (see Section 3). For one sample image, we computed the two metrics reconstruction_score and overfit_score. and the combined value of dissimilarity (δ) and showed how these values change ( Figure 4). The reconstruction_ score will increase to 100 quickly for the incomplete image, indicating that the image is already existing. The overfit score is highly correlated with the distance between gaps that are observed in fragmented contours, i.e., the larger the gap results in a larger γ value. We want to achieve an output image that has a reconstruction_ Score equal to 100 and an overfit Score of γ which is a hyperparameter that is dependent on the image and complexity of the shape. In this paper, we tried to create artificial shapes that are occluded by some masks. We then tried to see if our model can regenerate the missing pieces and glue those divided contours together.

We propose an unconventional nonlinear dynamical Hall effect characteristic of twisted bilayers. The joint action of in-plane and out-of-plane ac electric fields generates Hall currents j ∼ Ė⊥ × E in both sum and difference frequencies, and when the two orthogonal fields have common frequency their phase difference controls the on/off, direction and magnitude of the rectified dc Hall current.
This novel intrinsic Hall response has a band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection polarizability, arising from layer hybridization of electrons by the twisted interlayer coupling. The effect allows a unique rectification functionality and a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems.
We show sizable effects in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides and twisted bilayer graphene over broad range of twist angles. Nonlinear Hall-type response to an in-plane electric field in a two dimensional (2D) system with time reversal symmetry has attracted marked interests . Intensive studies have been devoted to uncovering new types of nonlinear Hall transport induced by quantum geometry and their applications such as terahertz rectification and magnetic information readout .
Restricted by symmetry , the known mechanisms of nonlinear Hall response in quasi-2D nonmagnetic materials are all of extrinsic nature, sensitive to fine details of disorders , which have limited their utilization for practical applications. Moreover, having a single driving field only, the effect has not unleashed the full potential of nonlinearity for enabling controlled gate in logic operation, where separable inputs (i.e., in orthogonal directions) are desirable.
The latter, in the context of Hall effect, calls for control by both out-of-plane and in-plane electric fields. A strategy to introduce quantum geometric response to out-of-plane field in quasi-2D geometry is made possible in van der Waals (vdW) layered structures with twisted stacking . Taking homobilayer as an example, electrons have an active layer degree of freedom that is associated with an out-of-plane electric dipole , whereas interlayer quantum tunneling rotates this pseudospin about in-plane axes that are of topologically nontrivial textures in the twisted landscapes .
Such layer pseudospin structures can underlie novel quantum geometric properties when coupled with out-ofplane field. Recent studies have found layer circular photogalvanic effect and layer-contrasted time-reversaleven Hall effect , arising from band geometric quantities. In this work we unveil a new type of nonlinear Hall effect in time-reversal symmetric twisted bilayers, where an intrinsic Hall current emerges under the combined action of an in-plane electric field E and an out-of-plane ac field E ⊥ (t): j ∼ Ė⊥ × E [see Fig. ].
Having the two driving fields (inputs) and the current response (output) all orthogonal to each other, the effect is dubbed as the crossed nonlinear dynamical Hall effect. This is also the first nonlinear Hall contribution of an intrinsic nature in nonmagnetic materials without external magnetic field, determined solely by the band structures, not relying on extrinsic factors such as disorders and relaxation times.
The effect arises from the interlayer hybridization of electronic states under the chiral crystal symmetry characteristic of twisted bilayers, and has a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection polarizability (BCP). Having two driving fields of the same frequency, a dc Hall current develops, whose on/off, direction and magnitude can all be controlled by the phase difference of the two fields, which does not affect the magnitude of the double-frequency component.
Such a characteristic tunability renders this effect a unique approach to rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers. As examples, we show sizable effects in small angle twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) and twisted bilayer graphene (tBG), as well as tBG of large angles where Umklapp interlayer tunneling dominates.
Geometric origin of the effect. A bilayer system couples to in-plane and out-of-plane driving electric fields in completely different ways. The in-plane field couples to the 2D crystal momentum, leading to Berry-phase effects in the 2D momentum space . In comparison, the outof-plane field is coupled to the interlayer dipole moment p in the form of −E ⊥ p, where p = ed 0 σz with σz as the Pauli matrix in the layer index subspace and d 0 the interlayer distance.
When the system has a more than twofold rotational axis in the z direction, as in tBG and tTMDs, any in-plane current driven by the out-of-plane field alone is forbidden. It also prohibits the off-diagonal components of the symmetric part of the conductivity tensor σ ab = ∂j a /∂E ||,b with respect to the in-plane input and output.
Since the antisymmetric part of σ ab is not allowed by the Onsager reciprocity in nonmagnetic systems, all the off-diagonal components of σ ab is forbidden, irrespective of the order of out-of-plane field. On the other hand, as we will show, an in-plane Hall conductivity σ xy = −σ yx can still be driven by the product of an in-plane field and the time variation rate of an outof-plane ac field, which is a characteristic effect of chiral bilayers.
To account for the effect, we make use of the semiclassical theory . The velocity of an electron in a bilayer system is given by where k is the 2D crystal momentum. Here and hereafter we suppress the band index for simplicity, unless otherwise noted. The three contributions in this equation come from the band velocity, the anomalous velocities induced by the k -space Berry curvature Ω k and by the hybrid Berry curvature Ω kE ⊥ in the (k, E ⊥ ) space.
For the velocity at the order of interest, the k-space Berry curvature is corrected to the first order of the variation rate of out-of-plane field Ė⊥ as Here A = u k |i∂ k |u k is the unperturbed k-space Berry connection, with |u k being the cell-periodic part of the Bloch wave, whereas is its gauge invariant correction , which can be identified physically as an in-plane positional shift of an electron induced by the time evolution of the out-of-plane field.
For a band with index n, we have whose numerator involves the interband matrix elements of the interlayer dipole and velocity operators, and ε n is the unperturbed band energy. Meanwhile, up to the first order of in-plane field, the hybrid Berry curvature reads Here A E || is the k-space Berry connection induced by E || field , which represents an intralayer positional shift and whose detailed expression is not needed for our purpose.
and is its first order correction induced by the in-plane field. In addition, ε = ε + δε, where δε = eE • G Ė⊥ is the field-induced electron energy . Given that A E || is the E ⊥ -space counterpart of intralayer shift A E || , and that E ⊥ is conjugate to the interlayer dipole moment, we can pictorially interpret A E || as the interlayer shift induced by in-plane field.
It indeed has the desired property of flipping sign under the horizontal mirror-plane reflection, hence is analogous to the so-called interlayer coordinate shift introduced in the study of layer circular photogalvanic effect , which is nothing but the E ⊥ -space counterpart of the shift vector well known in the nonlinear optical phenomenon of shift current.
Therefore, the E ⊥ -space BCP eG/ can be understood as the interlayer BCP. This picture is further augmented by the connotation that the interlayer BCP is featured exclusively by interlayer-hybridized electronic states: According to Eq. ( ), if the state |u n is fully polarized in a specific layer around some momentum k, then G (k) is suppressed.
With the velocity of individual electrons, the charge current density contributed by the electron system can be obtained from where [dk] is shorthand for n d 2 k/(2π) 2 , and the distribution function is taken to be the Fermi function f 0 as we focus on the intrinsic response. The band geometric contributions to ṙ lead to a Hall current
where is intrinsic to the band structure. This band geometric quantity measures the k-space curl of the interlayer BCP over the occupied states, and hence is also a characteristic of layer-hybridized electronic states. Via an integration by parts, it becomes clear that χ int is a Fermi surface property.
Since χ int is a time-reversal even pseudoscalar, it is invariant under rotation, but flips sign under space inversion, mirror reflection and rotoreflection symmetries. As such, χ int is allowed if and only if the system possesses a chiral crystal structure, which is the very case of twisted bilayers .
Moreover, since twisted structures with opposite twist angles are mirror images of each other, whereas the mirror reflection flips the sign of χ int , the direction of Hall current can be reversed by reversing twist direction. Hall rectification and frequency doubling. This effect can be utilized for the rectification and frequency doubling of an in-plane ac input E = E 0 cos ωt, provided that the out-of-plane field has the same frequency, namely E ⊥ = E 0 ⊥ cos (ωt + ϕ).
The phase difference ϕ between the two fields plays an important role in determining the Hall current, which takes the form of j = j 0 sin ϕ + j 2ω sin(2ωt + ϕ). ( Here ω is required to be below the threshold for direct interband transition in order to validate the semiclassical treatment, and σ H has the dimension of conductance and quantifies the Hall response with respect to the in-plane input.
In experiment, the Hall output by the crossed nonlinear dynamic Hall effect can be distinguished readily from the conventional nonlinear Hall effect driven by in-plane field alone, as they are odd and even, respectively, in the inplane field. One notes that while the double-frequency component appears for any ϕ, the rectified output is allowed only if the two crossed driving fields are not in-phase or antiphase.
Its on/off, chirality (right or left), and magnitude are all controlled by the phase difference of the two fields. Such a unique tunability provides not only a prominent experimental hallmark of this effect, but also a controllable route to Hall rectification. In addition, reversing the direction of the out-of-plane field switches that of the Hall current, which also serves as a control knob.
Application to tTMDs. We now study the effect quantitatively in tTMDs, using tMoTe 2 as an example (see details of the continuum model in ). For illustrative purposes, we take ω/2π = 0.1 THz and E 0 ⊥ d 0 = 10 mV in what follows. Figures ) and (c) present the electronic band structures along with the layer composition σ z n (k) at twist angles θ = 1.2 • and θ = 2 • .
In both cases, the energy spectra exhibit isolated narrow bands with strong layer hybridization. At θ = 1.2 • , the conductivity shows two peaks ∼ 0.1e 2 /h at low energies associated with the first two valence bands. The third band does not host any sizable conductivity signal. At higher hole-doping levels, a remarkable conductivity peak ∼ e 2 /h appears near the gap separating the fourth and fifth bands.
At θ = 2 • , the conductivity shows smaller values, but the overall trends are similar: A peak ∼ O(0.01)e 2 /h appears at low energies, while larger responses ∼ O(0.1)e 2 /h can be spotted as the Fermi level decreases. One can understand the behaviors of σ H from the interlayer BCP in Eq. ( ). It favors band near-degeneracy regions in k -space made up of strongly layer hybridized electronic states.
As such, the conductivity is most pro- nounced when the Fermi level is located around such regions, which directly accounts for the peaks of response in Fig. that [∂ k × G] z is negligible at lower energies, and it is dominated by positive values as the doping increases, thus the conductivity rises initially.
When the doping level is higher, regions with [∂ k × G] z < 0 start to contribute, thus the conductivity decreases after reaching a maximum. Application to tBG. The second example is tBG. We focus on commensurate twist angles in the large angle limit in the main text , which possess moiré-lattice assisted strong interlayer tunneling via Umklapp processes .
This case is appealing because the Umklapp interlayer tunneling is a manifestation of discrete translational symmetry of moiré superlattice, which is irrelevant at small twist angles and not captured by the continuum model but plays important roles in physical contexts such as higher order topological insulator and moiré excitons .
The Umklapp tunneling is strongest for the commensurate twist angles of θ = 21.8 • and θ = 38.2 • , whose corresponding periodic moiré superlattices have the smallest lattice constant ( √ 7 of the monolayer counterpart). Such a small moiré scale implies that the exact crystalline symmetry, which depends sensitively on fine details of rotation center, has critical influence on lowenergy response properties.
To capture the Umklapp tunneling, we employ the tight-binding model . Figures ) and (c) show two distinct commensurate structures of tBG at θ = 21.8 • belonging to chiral point groups D 3 and D 6 , respectively. The atomic configurations in Figs. ) are equivalent, which are constructed by twisting AA-stacked bilayer graphene around an overlapping atom site, and that in Fig. ) is obtained by rotating around a hexagonal center.
Band structures of these two configurations are drastically different within a low-energy window of ∼ 10 meV around the κ point . Remarkably, despite large θ, we still get σ H ∼ O(0.001) e 2 /h (D 3 ) and ∼ O(0.1) e 2 /h (D 6 ), which are comparable to those at small angles (cf. Fig. in the Supplemental Material ).
Such sizable responses can be attributed to the strong interlayer coupling enabled by Umklapp processes . Apart from different intensities, the Hall conductivities in the two stacking configurations have distinct energy dependence: In Fig. , σ H shows a single peak centered at zero energy; In Fig. (f), it exhibits two antisymmetric peaks around zero.
The peaks are centered around band degeneracies, and their profiles can be understood from the distribution of [∂ k × G] z . Figure (d) illustrates the atomic structure of tBG with a twist angle slightly deviating from θ = 21.8 • , forming a supermoiré pattern. In short range, the local stacking geometries resemble the commensurate configurations at θ = 21.8 • , while the stacking registries at different locales differ by a translation.
Similar to the moiré landscapes in the small-angle limit, there also exist high-symmetry locales: Regions A and B enclose the D 3 structure, and region C contains the D 6 configuration. Position-dependent Hall response is therefore expected in such a supermoiré. As the intrinsic Hall signal from the D 6 configuration dominates [see Figs.
3(e) vs (f)], the net response mimics that in Fig. . Discussion. We have uncovered the crossed nonlinear dynamical intrinsic Hall effect characteristic of layer hybridized electronic states in twisted bilayers, and elucidated its geometric origin in the k -space curl of interlayer BCP. It offers a new tool for rectification and frequency doubling in chiral vdW bilayers, and is sizable in tTMD and tBG.
Here our focus is on the intrinsic effect, which can be evaluated quantitatively for each material and provides a benchmark for experiments. There may also be extrinsic contributions, similar to the side jump and skew scattering ones in anomalous Hall effect. They typically have distinct scaling behavior with the relaxation time τ from the intrinsic effect, hence can be distinguished from the latter in experiments .
Moreover, they are suppressed in the clean limit ωτ 1 [(ωτ ) 2 1, more precisely] . In high-quality tBG samples, τ ∼ ps at room temperature . Much longer τ can be obtained at lower temperatures. In fact, a recent theory explaining well the resistivity of tBG predicted τ ∼ 10 −8 s at 10 K . As such, high-quality tBG under low temperatures and sub-terahertz input (ω/2π = 0.1 THz) is located in the clean limit, rendering an ideal platform for isolating the intrinsic effect.
This work paves a new route to driving in-plane response by out-of-plane dynamical control of layered vdW structures . The study can be generalized to other observables such as spin current and spin polarization, and the in-plane driving can be statistical forces, like temperature gradient. Such orthogonal controls rely critically on the nonconservation of layer pseudospin degree of freedom endowed by interlayer coupling, and constitute an emerging research field at the crossing of 2D vdW materials, layertronics, twistronics and nonlinear electronics.

The central bands are well separated from higher ones, and show Dirac points at κ/κ points protected by valley U (1) symmetry and a composite operation of twofold rotation and time reversal C 2z T . Degeneracies at higher energies can also be identified, for example, around ±75 meV at the γ point. As the two Dirac cones from the two layers intersect around the same area, such degeneracies are usually accompanied by strong layer hybridization [see the color in the left panel of Fig. ].
Additionally, it is well-known that the two layers are strongly coupled when θ is around the magic angle (∼ 1.08 • ), rendering narrow bandwidths for the central bands. As discussed in the main text, coexistence of strong interlayer hybridization and small energy separations is expected to contribute sharp conductivity peaks near band degeneracies, as shown in Fig. .
In this case, the conductivity peak near the Dirac point can reach ∼ 0.1e 2 /h, while the responses around ±0.08 eV are smaller at ∼ 0.01e 2 /h. The above features are maintained when θ is enlarged, as illustrated in Figs. ) and (c) using θ = 2.65 • and θ = 6.01 • . Since interlayer coupling becomes weaker and the bands are more separated at low energies when θ increases, intensity of the conductivity drops significantly.
We stress that G is not defined at degenerate points, and interband transitions may occur when energy separation satisfies |ε n − ε m | ∼ ω, the effects of which are not included in the current formulations. Consequently, the results around band degeneracies within energy ∼ ω [shaded areas in Fig. ] should be excluded.",['The momentum space curl of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability generates the crossed nonlinear dynamical Hall effect.'],3508,multifieldqa_en,en,,7d9bc0ed11dfc39ab91980d15a95fcd9f5902d25f85ec436," We show sizable effects in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides and twisted bilayer graphene over broad range of twist angles.

abstract

We introduce a quantum error mitigation technique based on probabilistic error cancellation to eliminate errors which have accumulated during the application of a quantum circuit. Our approach is based on applying an optimal ""denoiser"" after the action of a noisy circuit and can be performed with an arbitrary number of extra gates.
The denoiser is given by an ensemble of circuits distributed with a quasiprobability distribution. For a simple noise model, we show that efficient, local denoisers can be found, and we demonstrate their effectiveness for the digital quantum simulation of the time evolution of simple spin chains. Introduction.
-Quantum information processing has been theoretically shown to hold great promises, and quantum algorithms were developed which can in principle achieve an exponential speed-up over their classical counterparts, both for general purpose computing and quantum simulation . However, present day quantum computing prototypes still suffer from significant noise processes which hinder the execution of many potentially groundbreaking quantum algorithms .
Nontrivial quantum algorithms typically require large sequences of quantum gates, each of which introduces dissipation and hence an overall loss of coherence, eventually rendering the results useless. Until quantum error correction becomes practical, quantum error mitigation seems to be more feasible to increase the accuracy of expectation values.
Here the goal is to induce the (partial) cancellation of errors that stem from noisy quantum gates by extending the circuit corresponding to the desired algorithm with an ensemble of gates , sampled from a quasiprobability distribution. The traditional way to accomplish this is with the gatewise method from , where noise is mitigated by inverting the noise channel of each gate separately, i.e. the cancellation of errors is performed for each gate on its own.
Here the local noise channel is approximated in a way such that it can be easily inverted analytically, e.g. using Pauli twirling . Gates are then sampled from the inverted noise channel by interpreting it as a quasiprobability distribution. Because in this gate-wise approach every noisy gate has to be modified separately, the sign problem is exponentially large in the number of gates, limiting the practicality of the mitigation.
The success of the gate-wise approach resulted in a large body of work concerning these methods , including extensions for simultaneous mitigation of multiple gates by Pauli-twirling entire layers or variationally constructing a mitigating matrix product operator . In principle, errors during the execution of a circuit can propagate and accumulate.

FIG. 1. An example of the quantum error mitigation procedure used in this work for the time evolution of the wave function of a spin chain. The ideal second-order Trotter supercircuit C of depth Mtrot = 1 (light blue) is approximated by applying a denoiser D of depth M = 1 (red) to the noisy Trotter supercircuit C (dark blue).
Because the denoiser is applied after fully executing the noisy Trotter supercircuit, it represents an approximate inverse of the global noise channel with a precision tunable by the depth of the denoiser. can potentially blow up and lead to large errors for the circuit as a whole . Here we introduce a mitigation technique that takes into account the propagation of errors, can be performed with a tunable number of extra gates, and works for non-Clifford local noise channels since the inversion of the accumulated global noise channel is implicit.
We first execute the targeted noisy circuit completely, letting the noise propagate and accumulate, and only afterwards we apply an extra random circuit sampled from a quasiprobability distribution. We call the corresponding ensemble of random circuits a denoiser, and we construct it such that upon averaging the accumulated errors cancel.
Essentially, the denoiser inverts a global noise channel. Since we will construct it as a local brickwall circuit, following the classical preprocessing approach from , we call this compressed quantum error mitigation. Method. -Due to the inevitable coupling of a quantum processor to its environment, every qubit operation is affected by noise.
Therefore, the simplest technique to minimize the impact of the resulting noise is to minimize the number of operations when performing a quantum algorithm. In we showed that many-body time evolution operators can be efficiently compressed into brick-wall circuits with high fidelity per gate. In this Letter, we consider the noise explicitly by treating quantum operations as (generally non-unitary) quantum channels, corresponding to completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) maps .
For example, instead of a noiseless two-qubit gate G, which acts on a quantum state |ρ in superoperator form as G|ρ = G⊗G * |ρ , we get the noisy channel G = N G, where the noise channel N implements the two-qubit noise . These channels are used to construct a ""supercircuit"" C = N G i=1 Gi , consisting of N G channels, which is affected by multi-qubit accumulated noise.
This supercircuit encodes an ensemble of circuits . For simplicity, we assume that the noisy channels Gi in each half brickwall layer are lattice inversion and translation invariant, such that we can construct a denoiser with these properties, limiting the number of variational parameters. The purpose of quantum error mitigation is to modify the ensemble of circuits described by C in a way that we can use it to obtain the noiseless expectation values.
In superoperator language, we do this by following the supercircuit C with a denoiser supercircuit D, such that D C is as close to the noiseless supercircuit C = C ⊗ C * as possible. Here C is the target unitary circuit. Because the noise channel N is non-unitary, hence making the supercircuit C non-unitary, we need to use a non-unitary denoiser to retrieve the unitary C.
We illustrate the mitigation procedure in Fig. , where a denoiser with one layer is used to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with one layer. This circuit architecture is commonly used to simulate the time evolution of a quantum many-body system, until some time t, with controllable precision , and we will use it to benchmark the denoiser.
In practice, we cannot directly implement a supercircuit, and so we have to utilize its interpretation as an ensemble of circuits. Essentially, after executing a shot of the noisy circuit we sample the denoiser and apply it. The goal is to construct the denoiser in a way that averaging over many of its samples cancels the accumulated errors and gives us a good approximation of the noiseless expectation values.
It should be noted that our approach requires more gate applications on the quantum processor than with the gate-wise scheme, since there each sample from the mitigation quasiprobability distribution can be absorbed into the original circuit, whereas our approach increases the circuit depth. We take this into account by imposing the same noise on the denoiser.
Furthermore, within our scheme, the dimensionality of the quasiprobabilistic mitigating ensemble can be controlled, in contrast to the gate-wise approach where it is equal to the gate count. To facilitate the stochastic interpretation we parameterize each two-qubit denoiser channel G i as a sum of CPTP maps, such that we can sample the terms in this sum and execute the sampled gate on the quantum processor.
Concretely, we use a trace preserv-ing sum of a unitary and a non-unitary channel. For the unitary part we take a two-qubit unitary channel U( φ i ) = U ( φ i ) ⊗ U * ( φ i ), with U ( φ i ) a two-qubit unitary gate parameterized by φ i . For this we take the two-qubit ZZ rotation exp(−iα(σ z ⊗ σ z )) with angle α, which can be obtained from native gates on current hardware , and dress it with four general one-qubit unitaries, only two of which are independent if we want a circuit that is space inversion symmetric around every bond.
The resulting gate has 7 real parameters φ i . For the non-unitary part, which is essential because D has to cancel the non-unitary accumulated noise to obtain the noiseless unitary circuit, we use a general onequbit measurement followed by conditional preparation channel M( , with V a general one-qubit unitary and each κ i a 3-dimensional vector, resulting in a real 9-dimensional ζ i .
This yields the two-qubit correlated measurement M( With these parts we construct the parameterization with coefficients η i ∈ R that satisfy η 0 + η 1 = 1 because G i is trace preserving. Note that here the tensor product symbol corresponds to combining two one-qubit channels to make a two-qubit channel, whereas in most of the paper it is used to link the column and row indices of a density matrix.
We construct the denoiser from the noisy channels Gi = N G i . With this parameterization one denoiser channel has 17 independent real parameters, such that a denoiser of depth M , i.e. consisting of M brickwall layers, has 34M real parameters (we use one unique channel per half brickwall layer). For reference, a general channel has 544M parameters.
To determine the mitigated expectation values we use the full expression where |ρ 0 is the initial state and |1 is the vectorized identity operator on the full Hilbert space. To evaluate this on a quantum processor, we use the stochastic interpretation of (1) to resample . In particular, from each channel (1) we get a unitary with probability p 0 = |η 0 |/γ and a measurement followed by conditional preparation with probability p 1 = |η 1 |/γ.
Here γ = |η 0 | + |η 1 | is the sampling overhead, which characterizes the magnitude of the sign problem from negative η i . For quasiprobability distributions, i.e. with γ > 1, every denoiser sample has an extra sign sgn(η) = N G g=1 sgn(η g ), 2. The normalized distance between the denoised Trotter supercircuit D C and the noiseless Trotter supercircuit C (top panels), at evolution times t = 0.5, 1, ..., 5, and the twopoint z-spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (t) of a spin on the middle site at times 0 and t (bottom panels), for the infinite temperature initial state.
We consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and second-order Trotter circuits with depths Mtrot = 16, 32, 64. In the top panels we use a Heisenberg chain with L = 8, and in the bottom panels with L = 14, both with periodic boundary conditions. All gates are affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p = 0.01.
The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0, and the noiseless values with p = 0. where sgn(η g ) is the sign of the sampled coefficient of the gth channel. γ = 1 means that all signs are positive. Observables Ô p=0 for the noiseless circuit are then approximated by resampling the observables from the denoiser ensemble
where γ = N G g=1 γ g is the overall sampling overhead, with γ g the overhead of the gth gate. Clearly, a large γ implies a large variance of Ô p=0 for a given number of samples, with accurate estimation requiring the cancellation of large signed terms. The number of samples required to resolve this cancellation of signs is bounded by Hoeffding's inequality, which states that a sufficient number of samples to estimate Ô p=0 with error δ at probability 1 − ω is bounded by (2γ 2 /δ 2 ) ln(2/ω) .
Since γ scales exponentially in γ g , it is clear that a denoiser with large M and γ 1 will require many samples. We observed that decompositions with γ > 1 are crucial for an accurate denoiser. Restricting to γ = 1 leads to large infidelity and no improvement upon increasing the number of terms in or the depth M of the denoiser.
Simply put, probabilistic error cancellation of gate noise introduces a sign problem and it is crucial to find optimal parameterizations (1) which minimize γ to make the approach scalable. This issue arises in all high performance error mitigation schemes , because the inverse of a physical noise channel is unphysical and cannot be represented as a positive sum over CPTP maps.
This is clearly visible in the spectra of the denoiser, which lies outside the unit circle (cf. Fig. ). This makes the tunability of the number of gates in each denoiser sample a crucial ingredient, which allows control over the sign problem, because we can freely choose the η i in . For the parametrization (1) of denoiser channels, we try to find a set of parameters for error mitigation by minimizing the normalized Frobenius distance between the noiseless and denoised supercircuits
which bounds the distance of output density matrices and becomes zero for perfect denoising. We carry out the minimization of on a classical processor, using gradient descent with the differential programming algorithm from . Instead of explicitly calculating the accumulated global noise channel and subsequently inverting it, we approximate the noiseless supercircuit C with the denoised supercircuit D C, effectively yielding a circuit representation D of the inverse noise channel.
Results. -To benchmark the denoiser we apply it to the second-order Trotter circuits of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) where is the Pauli algebra acting on the local Hilbert space of site i. A second-order Trotter circuit for evolution time t with depth M trot consists of M trot − 1 half brickwall layers with time step t/M trot and two layers with half time step .
We consider circuits that are affected by uniform depolarizing noise with probability p for simplicity, but our approach can be used for any non-Clifford noise. The two-qubit noise channel is which acts on neighboring qubits i and i + 1 and is applied to each Trotter and denoiser gate, and p = 0.01 unless stated otherwise.
We study circuits with depths M trot = 16, 32, 64 for evolution times t = 0.5, 1, ..., 5, and denoisers D with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8. In the top panels of Fig. we show (4) for a chain of size L = 8 as a function of time t. Here it can be seen that even for M trot = 32 a denoiser with M = 1 already improves by roughly an order of magnitude at all considered t.
Depending on M trot and t, further increasing M lowers , with the biggest improvements occurring for high precision Trotter circuits with large depth M trot = 64 and short time t = 0.5, where the Trotter gates are closer to the identity than in the other cases. At the other extreme, for M trot = 16 the improvements are relatively small upon increasing M > 2. In all cases the denoiser works better at early times than at late times, again indicating that it is easier to denoise Trotter gates that are relatively close to the identity.
To probe the accuracy of the denoiser on quantities that do not enter the optimization, as a first test we consider the two-point correlator between spins at different times where we have chosen the infinite temperature initial state, and C(t) is the Trotter supercircuit for time t. In the bottom panels of Fig. we show C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (t) for the supercircuits from the upper panels, now for a L = 14 chain.
Here we see that at M trot = 16 we can retrieve the noiseless values already with M = 1, but that increasing M trot makes this more difficult. At M trot = 64 we see larger deviations, and improvement upon increasing M is less stable, but nonetheless we are able to mitigate errors to a large extent. As a further test, we compute the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) ]
In Fig. we show the results for i = L/2, for a Trotter circuit with depth M trot = 32 and a denoiser with depth M = 2. Here we see that a denoiser with M M trot is able to recover the light-cone of correlations, which are otherwise buried by the noise. In the Supplementary Material we consider how the denoiser performs at different noise levels p, and how the denoised supercircuits perform under stacking.
There we also calculate domain wall magnetization dynamics, and show the distribution of the optimized denoiser parameters and the sampling overhead associated to the denoiser as a whole. In Fig. we show the eigenvalues of the noisy supercircuits for a noisy second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 at t = 1 (left), the corresponding optimized denoiser with M = 4 (center), and the denoised supercircuit (right).
The eigenvalues λ of a unitary supercircuit lie on the unit circle, and in the presence of dissipation they are pushed to the center. We see that the spectrum of the denoiser lies outside the unit circle, making it an unphysical channel which cures the effect of the noise on the circuit, such that the spectrum of the denoised circuit is pushed back to the unit circle.
The noiseless eigenvalues are shown as blue bars, making it clear that the denoiser is able to recover the noiseless eigenvalues from the noisy circuit. In the Supplementary Material we show the spectra for a p = 0.036 denoiser, where we observe a clustering of eigenvalues reminiscent of Refs. . There we also investigate the channel entropy of the various supercircuits .
Conclusion. -We have introduced a probabilistic error cancellation scheme, where a classically determined denoiser mitigates the accumulated noise of a (generally non-Clifford) local noise channel. The required number of mitigation gates, i.e. the dimensionality of the corresponding quasiprobability distribution, is tunable and the parameterization of the corresponding channels provides control over the sign problem that is inherent to probabilistic error cancellation.
We have shown that a denoiser with one layer can already significantly mitigate errors for second-order Trotter circuits with up to 64 layers. This effectiveness of low-depth compressed circuits for denoising, in contrast with the noiseless time evolution operator compression from , can be understood from the non-unitarity of the denoiser channels.
In particu-lar, measurements can have non-local effects, since the measurement of a single qubit can reduce some highly entangled state (e.g. a GHZ state) to a product state, whereas in unitary circuits the spreading of correlations forms a light-cone. To optimize a denoiser with convenience at L > 8, the optimization can be formulated in terms of matrix product operators or channels , which is convenient because the circuit calculations leading to the normalized distance and its gradient are easily formulated in terms of tensor contractions and singular value decompositions .
This provides one route to a practical denoiser, which is relevant because the targeted noiseless circuit and the accompanying noisy variant in (4) need to be simulated classically, confining the optimization procedure to limited system sizes with an exact treatment or limited entanglement with tensor networks.
Nonetheless, we can use e.g. matrix product operators to calculate (4) for some relatively small t, such that the noiseless and denoised supercircuits in (4) have relatively small entanglement, and then stack the final denoised supercircuit on a quantum processor to generate classically intractable states.
Analogously, we can optimize the channels exactly at some classically tractable size and then execute them on a quantum processor with larger size. Both approaches are limited by the light-cone of many-body correlations, as visualized in Fig. , because finite-size effects appear when the light-cone width becomes comparable with system size.
1. The normalized distance (left) and z spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (right), for a second-order Trotter supercircuit of depth Mtrot = 16 for time t = 1, affected by various twoqubit depolarizing errors p. We compare the values obtained with and without a denoiser, i.e. M > 0 and M = 0, to the noiseless values (p = 0).
The denoiser is affected by the same noise as the Trotter circuit. We consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and we use a L = 8 Heisenberg chain with PBC for the normalized distance, while for the correlator we use L = 14. * david.luitz@uni-bonn.de to observe that even for larger noise strength p, the local observable C zz improves significantly even with denoisers of depth M = 1.
For large noise strengths, we generally see that the optimization of the denoiser becomes difficult, leading to nonmonotonic behavior as a function of p, presumably because we do not find the global optimum of the denoiser. It is interesting to analyze the spectra of the supercircuits considered in this work.
As mentioned in the main text, the spectrum of the ideal, unitary supercircuit C lies on the unit circle. The comparison to this case is therefore instructive. In the main text, we showed an example of the spectra in Fig. for moderate noise strength. Here, we show additional data for stronger noise p = 0.036 in Fig. for a denoiser with M = 4 layers, optimized to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 layers at time t = 1.
The eigenvalues λ of the noisy supercircuit C are clustered close to zero, far away from the unit circle (except for λ = 1), showing that the circuit is strongly affected by the noise. To mitigate the impact of the noise, the denoiser consequently has to renormalize the spectrum strongly. If it accurately represents the inverse of the global noise channel, its spectrum has to lie far outside the unit circle, which is the case.
Interestingly, we observe a clustering of eigenvalues which is reminiscent to the spectra found in . By comparison to these works, we suspect that this is due to the local nature of the denoiser, and warrants further investigation. The right panel of Fig. shows the result of the denoiser, pushing the eigenvalues back to the unit circle, nearly with the exact same distribution along the circle as the noiseless eigenvalues (blue bars).
Due to the strong noise, this is not achieved perfectly, and it is clear that this cannot work in principle if the global noise channel has a zero eigenvalue. The complexity of an operator can be quantified by its operator entanglement entropy . Here we calculate the half-chain channel entanglement entropy S of the noiseless C, noisy C, denoiser D, and denoised D C supercircuits.
We define S as the entanglement entropy of the state that is related to a supercircuit C via the Choi-Jamio lkowski isomorphism, i.e. ψ C = χ C /N , where the process matrix χ ab,cd C = C ac,bd is simply a reshaped supercircuit and N ensures normalization. Then we have S = −Tr [ψ C ln ψ C ]. This entropy measure is a particular instance of the ""exchange entropy"", which characterizes the information exchange between a quantum system and its environment .
In Fig. we plot the various S for a second-order Trotter circuit with M trot = 16 at t = 2, for a denoiser with M = 4, both affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p ∈ [10 −3 , 10 −1 ]. The Trotter circuit is for a Heisenberg model with L = 6 and PBC. We see that at large p, the noise destroys entanglement in the noisy supercircuit, and that the denoiser S increases to correct for this, such that the denoised supercircuit recovers the noiseless S.
Here we investigate how denoised supercircuits perform upon repeated application. We optimize the denoiser for a Trotter supercircuit for a fixed evolution time t. Then, to reach later times, we stack the denoised supercircuit n times to approximate the evolution up to time nt: In Fig. we stack a denoised t = 1 supercircuit up to n = 20 times and calculate the correlation function, defined in the main text, for the middle site.
We consider Trotter depths M trot = 8, 16, 32, 64 and denoiser depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, for a L = 14 Heisenberg chain with p = 0.01 depolarizing two-qubit noise. The noisy results correspond to M = 0 and the noiseless results to p = 0. In Fig. we calculate the OTOC, defined in the main text, with stacked time evolution for a denoised t = 2 supercircuit with M trot = 32 and M = 2, stacked up to ten times.
We see that the stacked supercircuit performs very well, and the additional precision obtained by using deep denoisers (M = 8) pays off for long evolution times, where we see convergence to the exact result (black dashed lines in Fig. ) as a function of M . FIG. . The two-point z-spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (t) of a spin on the middle site at times 0 and t, for the infinite temperature initial state, for denoised second-order Trotter supercircuits that are optimized at evolution time t = 1 and then stacked up to twenty times.
We use Trotter depths Mtrot = 8, 16, 32, 64 and denoiser depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8. The calculations were performed for a periodic Heisenberg model with L = 14 and PBC, affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with strength p = 0.01, which also affects the denoiser. The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0, and the noiseless results with p = 0.
The panels are arranged as Mtrot = 8, 16, 32, 64 for top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, respectively. The costliest and most noise-susceptible operation is the two-qubit ZZ rotation with angle α, which is the foundation of the unitary piece in our channel parameterization, defined in the main text.
For completeness, we here present the α angles of the optimized denoisers. The results are shown in Fig. , which contains histograms for the channel count N G versus α. The histograms are stacked, with the lightest color corresponding to the angles of the denoiser at t = 0.5 and the darkest at t = 5. The top four panels are for a denoiser with M = 2 and the bottom four with M = 8.
We consider M trot = 8, 16, 32, 64. We see that in both cases the distribution widens upon increasing M trot , indicating that the unitary channels start deviating more from the identity. Moreover, while the M = 2 denoisers in all cases except M trot = 64 have ZZ contributions close to the identity, this is clearly not the case for M = 8.
For simplicity, we did not focus on obtaining denoisers with the smallest sampling overhead γ, which is required to minimize the sign problem and hence ease the sampling of mitigated quantities. Instead, we let the optimization freely choose the η i in the denoiser parameterization, as defined in the main text.
In Fig. we show the sampling overhead of the denoisers from Fig. of the main text. We see that for M = 1 and M = 2 the sampling overhead is relatively small and uniform across the different t, whereas for M > 2 the optimization sometimes yields a denoiser with large γ and other times with small γ. This could be related to the difference in α distributions from Fig. .
The large fluctuations of γ appears to stem from the difficulty in finding optimal deep denoisers, and our optimization procedure likely only finds a local minimum in these cases. Here C(t) is the Trotter supercircuit for time t. In Fig. we show Z dw for the circuits from Fig.","['Yes, the denoiser works for non-Clifford local noise channels.']",5389,multifieldqa_en,en,,13b04172d2261a0c9545a0e3670c1c43105ccab41ce1a726," We consider evolution times t = 0.5, 1,..., 5, for the periodic L = 14 Heisenberg chain that is affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p =0.01. The denoiser recovers with high accuracy the noiseless eigenvalues from the noisy circuit. The different curves correspond to the different supercircuits, i.e. the noisy supercircuit, the denoisers, the corresponding denoised super Circuit, and thenoiseless variant. We conclude that compressed quantum error mitigation can be used to improve the performance of quantum computers.

The. paper is also available in the online version with the. title Compressed Quantum Error Mitigation for Relativity and Theory Of Relativity. In principle, errors during the execution of a circuit can propagate and accumulate. We introduce a quantum error mitigation technique based on probabilistic error cancellation to eliminate errors which have accumulated during the application of a quantum circuit. Our approach is based on applying an optimal ""denoiser"" after the action of a noisy circuit and can be performed with an arbitrary number of extra gates. For a simple noise model, we show that efficient, local denoisers can be found, and we demonstrate their effectiveness for the digital quantum simulation of the time evolution of simple spin chains. We show that the denoiser allows us to recover the noiseless behavior of a Heisenberg chain that is affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise of strength p = 0.01. We conclude that quantum error correction seems to be more feasible to increase the accuracy of expectation values than the traditional gatewise method from, where noise is mitigated by inverting the noise channel of each gate separately, i.e. the cancellation of errors is performed for each gate on its own. In this Letter, we consider the noise explicitly by treating quantum operations as (generally non-unitary) quantum channels. The noise channel N implements the two-qubit noise. These channels are used to construct a ""supercircuit"" C = N G i=1 Gi, consisting of N G channels. This supercircuit encodes an ensemble of circuits. We call the corresponding ensemble of random circuits a denoiser, and we construct it such that upon averaging the accumulated errors cancel. We illustrate the mitigation procedure in Fig., where adenoiser with one layer is used to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuits with oneLayer. This circuit architecture is commonly used to simulate the time evolution of a quantum many-body system, until some time t, with controllable precision, and we will use it to benchmark the denoisers. We take this into account by imposing the same noise on the denoser as on the noisy circuit. The goal is to construct theDenoiser in a way that averaging over many of its samples cancels the accumulatederrors and gives a good approximation of the noiseless expectation values. We consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and second-order Trotter circuits with depths Mtrot = 16, 32, 64. All gates are affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p = 0.01. We use a trace preserv-ing sum of a unitary and a non-unitary channel. The number of samples required to resolve this cancellation of signs is bounded by Hoeffding's inequality, which is that a sufficient number of states is sufficient to estimate the error at 1.0. The normalized distance between the denoised Trotner supercircuit D C and the noiseless Trotters C (top panels), at evolution times t =0.5, 1,..., 5, and the twopoint z-spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=l/2 (t) of a spin on the middle site at times 0 and t (bottom panels), for the infinite temperature initial state. The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0 and the noniseless values with p= 0, where sgn(η) is the sampled coefficient of the gth channel. Observables are then approximated by resampling the ensemble ensemble. We find that decompositions with γ > 1 are crucial for an accurate denoiser. Restricting to γ = 1 leads to large infidelity and no improvement upon increasing the number of terms in or the depth M of the denoisers. We carry out the minimization of on a classical processor, using gradient descent with the differential programming algorithm from. Instead of explicitly calculating the accumulated global noise channel, we approximate the noiseless supercircuit C with the Denoised supercircuits D C. We consider circuits that are affected by uniform depolarizing noise with probability p for simplicity, but our approach can be used for any non-Clifford noise. The two-qubit noise channel is which acts on neighboring qubits i and i + 1 and is applied to each Trotter and Denoiser gate, and p = 0.01 unless stated otherwise. We study circuits with depths M trot = 16, 32, 64 for evolution times t.5, 1,..., 5, and denoisers D with depth M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8. We see that at M Trot = 64 we can retrieve the no iseless gates already, but that increasing Mtrot = 14 makes this more difficult. At M troT = 64, we are able to mitigate errors to a large extent, but nonetheless we see larger and larger deviations. We have shown that a denoiser with one layer can significantly mitigate errors for second-order Trotter circuits with up to 64 layers. The effectiveness of low-depth compressed circuits for denoising, in contrast with the noiseless time evolution operator compression from Refs., can be understood from the non-unitarity of the denoisers channels. The required number of mitigation gates, i.e. the dimensionality of the corresponding quasiprobability distribution, is tunable and provides control over the sign problem that is inherent to probabilistic error cancellation. We can use e.g. matrix product operators to calculate (4) for some relatively small t, and then stack the final denoised supercircuit on a quantum processor to generate classically intractable states. The normalized distance and its gradient are easily formulated in terms of tensor contractions and singular value decompositions.

We compare the values obtained with and without a denoiser, i.e. M > 0 and M = 0, to the noiseless values (p = 0). We observe that even for larger noise strength p, the local observable C Zz improves significantly even with denoisers of depth M = 1. For large noise strengths, we generally see that the optimization of the denoisers becomes difficult, leading to nonmonotonic behavior as a function of p. The complexity of an operator can be quantified by its operator entanglement entropy. Here we calculate the half-chain channel entangler entropy S of the noisy C, noisy C, denoising D, and denoised D C supercircuits. We find that the noise destroys the noisy supercircumuit, and that theDenoised S increases for this, such that the denOised S recovers the noise. We optimize the Denoising S to approximate the evolution up to nt = 20 times. We consider Trotter depths M trot = 8, 16, 32, 64 and denoiser depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 for a L = 14 Heisenberg chain with p = 0.01 depolarizing two-qubit noise.

In this Seminar we will discuss a series of constitutional problems including: the problem of executive energy in the American Constitution; presidential selection and the problem of political legitimacy; separation of powers; delegation of powers, the constitutional status of war and foreign affairs, administration and bureaucracy and the meaning of leadership in the constitutional order.
Seminar will meet twice a week and regular attendance and thorough preparation for discussion is expected. Unexcused absence from more than three classes will result in failure of the participation component of the course. There will also be pop quizzes on the reading that will count as part of your participation grade. In addition to class participation, course requirements include four short analytic essays, and one in-class test. The course grade will be calculated as follows:
Seminar participation: 20%
In-class test: 20%
Three analytic essays 60% (20% each)
Class participation is especially important. Preparation for seminar and for your in-class test will be enhanced by careful note taking on the readings. If students appear to be unprepared, pop quizzes will be given and the grades on them will affect the participation component of your course grade.

TTH 3:30-5:00pm, BEN 1.106
This honors seminar offers an introduction to American politics that emphasizes the confluence of ideas, mores, institutions, and interests, in the constitutional system. This course covers more theory, and the readings are more demanding, than other versions of GOV 310. One of the main objectives of the course is to deepen your understanding of the practical aspects of contemporary public affairs by developing your ability to understand the theoretical foundations of American politics. Although we cover the nuts and bolts of politics there is much more theory in this version of GOV 310. If you have registered for this section mainly because 310 is a legislative requirement that you need to fulfill, this is not the right version for you. There is a substantial workload in this class.
Regular attendance, thorough and timely preparation, and active participation are all necessary to do well.
Four essays (approximately 1000 words each). Three of these will be assigned analytic essay topics. The last will be a book review of a title chosen by the student from a long list of provided possibilities. (15% each essay, 60% of total course grade)
Two in-class tests. These will count 15% each, 30% of total course grade.
Class participation. (10% of course grade). Both informed participation and occasional leadership of the seminar will be graded.
No make-up exams or late papers, except for documented medical or other emergencies.

Constitutional Conflict
W 3:30-6:30pm, BAT 5.102
Many of the most important debates regarding the nature and character of contemporary American politics are essentially arguments regarding the structure of separation of powers. In this seminar we will consider such questions as whether the American system is prone to deadlock of stalemate in the construction of national policy; whether conflict is a hindrance to institutional responsibility or an essential attribute of responsibility; whether there are “political questions” especially suitable to resolution between President and Congress; how one can distinguish salutary from pathological conflict, and whether it is truly possible to harness the ambition of office holders to the duties of their office.
More specifically, we will review literature and arguments regarding constitutional reform; divided government; separation of powers theory; and case studies of Supreme Court appointments; the budget process; and war powers and foreign affairs. In these contexts we will also discuss current controversies surrounding war authorization, intelligence and secrecy, sequestration, government shut downs and budget resolutions, and debt ceiling politics.
The course is designed to accommodate two different student needs: it will provide a good overview of important literature relevant to the comprehensive examination in American politics and it will provide opportunities for research. This subject area is a treasure trove of “hot” topics, publication possibilities, subjects for MA theses and Ph.D. dissertations. I will tailor the written requirements to the objectives of individual students.
1. All students will prepare a short analytic essay early in the semester, and an annotated bibliography at mid-semester. These assignments will count (30%) of the grade.
2. Students interested primarily in exam preparation will complete an examination near the end of the semester based on study questions assigned in advance. OR
Students interested in research will write a 20-25 page paper. (60%)
3. A basic requirement of the course is that students prepare for each seminar by carefully reading the material assigned for that week. Class discussion is an essential component of the course. (10%)

GOV 379S Regime Perspectives on American Politics
This is a seminar on American politics and culture. Two purposes govern the selection of texts for the course and guide our discussion of them. All of our texts attempt to look at American politics as a whole. Most books and courses on America look at only a part, such as the Presidency, or elections, or popular culture. Here we attempt to think about how the parts of America fit together. Even when these texts speak about a part, for example an institution such as the presidency or the Congress, they present the topic from a vantage point on the whole polity. To see the polity as a whole also means that we will have to revisit and rethink aspects of our political life that we take for granted – that we don’t examine because those parts have become so natural or familiar to us. Seeing the polity whole enables us to render the familiar unfamiliar, to make what we take for granted strange and new.
To see the polity as a whole requires that we get some distance from our subject, much as to see the planet earth as a whole requires one to look at it from outer space. Just as it is difficult to get visual perspective on a place living within it, it is difficult to understand the promise or pathologies of a regime from within. To get critical distance from our politics, we will closely study three sets of texts that look at American politics from a distance. The first part of the course will recover the perspective of the founding debate between Federalists and Anti-federalists. This fundamental debate reveals what is a stake in the basic architecture of the American regime. The second part of the course is a close study of Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. Regarded by many as the best book ever written on democracy and the best book written on America, Tocqueville sees our polity whole because he looks at it from the vantage point of Europe, in general, and France, in particular. In the third part of the seminar we think about American politics from the perspective of thoughtful commentators who feel only nominally included in the polity. Half in and half out, these extraordinary black American writers reveal fissures and fault lines in the American regime. We end the class with a discussion of America’s place in the world today – examining a speech by a writer who articulately raises challenges to our self-understanding that are inarticulately expressed today in rage and ranting from enemies of the United States.
Three take home analytic essays, chosen from a list of topics I provide, each weighted 25% of the course grade. Late essays will not be accepted, except with a doctor’s excuse or a Dean’s excuse for family emergency.
OR as an option: you may write the two short essays (both together weighted 25%) and do a longer 15 page paper on a topic of your choice in consultation with me (weighted 50% of your course grade). Government honors students who are thinking of doing an honors thesis next year may prefer this option to begin to develop research and writing skills for longer work. Students who prefer this option will need to designate their preferred third short essay and have discussed with me a topic for their long paper by March 30. Texts:

This is a seminar on American political thought and constitutional design. It is designed for students of American politics and political theory. The principal themes include: 1) the nature of founding and its constitutive significance; 2) the relation of structure and power in American politics; 3) the meaning and significance of the Federalist/Anti-Federalist debate; 4) the philosophic background of the American founding; and 5) the relevance of the founding to debate to prospects for, and pathologies of, American politics today.
We will conduct a close reading of the Madison’s Notes, of The Federalist, and selected Anti-Federalist writings. We will also study a larger and growing body of secondary literature on the constitutional convention, ratification and early American political thought.

The American Founding and Problems of Constitutional Design
Jeffrey Tulis, Associate Professor, Department of Government
Sanford Levinson, Professor, School of Law
This Plan II seminar will be built around a close reading of the debates that informed the drafting and ratification of the U.S. Constitution. We aim to recover the perspective of these founding thinkers -- their way of thinking -- as much as their concrete ideas, in order to raise fundamental questions about the American political order today. Are some of the most important pathologies of American politics today rooted in design features of our original political architecture? Are the original answers to basic founding questions (such as ""how democratic is our Constitution?) still adequate for contemporary circumstances? What features of the Constitution should we preserve and what features should we amend, if possible? Would it be good for the polity as a whole to reconsider these questions in a new constitutional convention today, or would such an event be a political nightmare? Our reading will include notes from the founding conventions, writings by Federalists and Anti-Federalists, and present-day critiques of the American political order. Our aim will be to generate a dialogue between the thought of the founders and some of the best present day critics and supporters of the Constitution.

This subject area is a treasure trove of “hot’ topics, publication possibilities, subjects for MA theses and Ph.D. dissertations. All students will prepare a short analytic essay early in the semester, and an annotated bibliography at mid-semester. All of our texts attempt to look at American politics as a whole. Most books and courses on America look at only a part, such as the Presidency, or elections, or popular culture. Here we attempt to think about how the parts of America fit together. In the third part of the seminar we think about American politics from the perspective of thoughtful commentators who feel only nominally included in the polity. Half in and half out, these extraordinary black American writers reveal fissures and fault lines in the American regime. We end the class with a discussion of America’s place in the world today – examining a speech by a writer who articulately raises challenges to our self-understanding that are inarticulately expressed today in rage and ranting. Government honors students who are thinking of doing an honors thesis next year may prefer this option to begin to develop research and writing skills for longer work. Late essays will not be accepted, except with a doctor’s excuse or a Dean's excuse for family emergency. Topics to be covered include: democratic epistemology; deliberative democracy; the meaning of the people; oracular democracy; agonistic democracy; and possibly new theories of republicanism, representation and partisanship. Texts:Selected Anti-Federalist writings; Tocqueville, Democracy in America; The Rise and Decline of the American Republic; The Evolving Presidency; The Presidency in the Political System. Students will also be required to do a research/analytic paper; an annotated bibliography or review essay; a manuscript; and four analytic essays (approximately 1200 words). One term paper, (approximately 5000 words) will be required for all students. The class will be devoted to the principal writings of Tocqeville: Democracy in The Ancien Regime and the Revolution. It will also assess some of the best secondary studies of Teville including work by Jon Elster, Francois Furet, Sheldon Wolin, Harvey Mansfield, and Delba Winthrop. The course offers an over view of the place of the presidency in the American political order. Topics covered include: constitutional design of the office; nominations and elections; legislative leadership; leadership of the bureaucracy; staffing and organizing the White House; the presidency and the judiciary; war and emergencies. We will spend extra time this fall on the presidential campaign and election of 2012. The course is designed for students of American politics and political theory. It meets Tuesdays, 6:30 to 9:30pm in Batts Hall 1. The class is co-hosted by the Center for American Studies and the College of Arts and Sciences.

For the complete course, see the course information page. For. the full class, go to: http:// www.cbar.org/. Plan II seminar will be built around a close reading of the debates that informed the drafting and ratification of the U.S. Constitution. Reading will include notes from the founding conventions, writings by Federalists and Anti-Federalists, and present-day critiques of the American political order. Are the original answers to basic founding questions (such as ""how democratic is our Constitution?) still adequate for contemporary circumstances? What features of the Constitution should we preserve and what features should we amend, if possible? Would it be good for the polity as a whole to reconsider these questions in a new constitutional convention today, or would such an event be a political nightmare? Our aim will be to generate a dialogue between the thought of the founders and some of the best present day critics and supporters of theConstitution. A packet of selected articles, essays, and additional primary materials will be provided. The course will be taught by Jeffrey Tulis, Associate Professor, Department of Government, and Sanford Levinson, Professor, School of Law. n London; Paris; Jerusalem; Auckland, New Zealand; and Melbourne, Australia.

Methods and systems are described herein for quickly and easily displaying supplemental information about an event occurring in a media asset. In some embodiments, a media application may use a content-recognition module to determine the context of an event and distribute itemized tasks to multiple entities in order to generate the supplemental information about the event.
While viewing media assets (e.g., a television program), users may wish to learn more information about an event (e.g., a statement made by a person appearing in the media asset, the validity of a claim in an advertisement, etc.) occurring in the media asset. While some media assets allow a user to select additional options or added features (e.g., pop-up biographies about the cast and crew), when the added features appear and what topic the added features concern are determined by the content producer and not the user. Furthermore, as the added feature is derived from the content producer, the added feature may be biased or may present limited viewpoints about an event. Therefore, added features provided by a content producer may not provide the added information about an event that a user desires.
In order to gain the added information that a user desires, the user may use additional devices (e.g., a laptop computer) to search (e.g., using an Internet search engine) for more information about the event. However, without knowing the proper context (e.g., who said the statement, what was the tone of the statement, when was the statement said, etc.) of the event or what search terms to use to describe the context of the event (e.g., how to describe the tone of the statement), a user may not be able to determine (even using a search engine) more information about the event. Moreover, the use of general search terms may not provide the accuracy or precision needed by the user. Furthermore, even if a user may eventually determine the information, the effort and time required may distract the user from the media asset.
Accordingly, methods and systems are described herein for quickly and easily displaying supplemental information about an event occurring in a media asset. In some embodiments, a media application may use a content-recognition module to determine the context of an event in a media asset and distribute itemized tasks to multiple users in order to generate the supplemental information about the event. The context-recognition module prevents the user from being distracted from the media asset (e.g., while the user attempts to describe the context of the event or search for information about the event). In addition, by distributing tasks to multiple entities (e.g., crowd-sourcing), the media application may collect large amounts of information in relatively short periods of time (or in real-time) and aggregate and/or filter the information to generate the supplemental information about the event based on multiple viewpoints and/or sources. By using multiple viewpoints and/or sources, the media application enhances the completeness (e.g., by providing unbiased information) and accuracy of the supplemental information.
For example, when a statement or action is made by a character or person appearing on a media asset (e.g., a television program), a user may request supplemental information about the statement or action. In response, the media application may determine the context of the statement (e.g., who said the statement and to what the statement was referring) or action (e.g., what was the reason for the action). After determining the context of the statement or action, the media application may itemize into tasks the additional information it requires in order to generate the supplemental information. The media application may then transmit requests including the tasks to a plurality of other users. Based on the responses from the plurality of other users, the media application may generate the supplemental information for display to the user.
In some embodiments, a media application may use multiple types of content-recognition modules and/or algorithms to determine the context of an event. For example, the media application may process data associated with the event in order to determine the context of an event. In some embodiments, processing the various types of data may include cross-referencing the data in a database indicating the different contexts the event may have.
In some embodiments, a media application may generate supplemental information about an event in a media asset in response to a user request. In order to generate the supplemental information, the media application may transmit, to multiple users, a request for additional information regarding a context of an event shown in a media asset. Upon receiving messages from the plurality of users that include the requested additional information, the media application may generate the supplemental information associated with the context of the event based on the messages.
It should be noted, the systems and/or methods described above may be applied to, or used in accordance with, other systems, methods and/or apparatuses.
FIG. 9 is a flowchart of illustrative steps for generating supplemental information based on additional information provided by a plurality of users in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.
Accordingly, methods and systems are described herein for quickly and easily displaying supplemental information about an event occurring in a media asset. The methods and systems described herein alleviate the need for a user to determine the proper context (e.g., who said a statement, what was the tone of the statement, when was the statement said, etc.) of an event in a media asset, or the search terms to use to describe the event (e.g., the proper search terms to describe the tone of the statement), in order to determine more information about the event. In addition, the methods and systems increase the completeness and accuracy of the information compared to information gathered using traditional searching methods (e.g., an Internet search engine), without distracting the user from the media asset.
In some embodiments, a media application may receive a user input from a user device for supplemental information about the context of an event shown in a media asset. The media application may determine additional information required to generate the supplemental information about the context of the event shown in a media asset, and transmit requests for the additional information to one or more users. The media application may receive one or more messages, which include the requested additional information, from the one or more users and generate the supplemental information based on the one or more message. The media application may then instruct the user device to display the supplemental information.
As used herein, “supplemental information” refers to any information related to or associated with an event in a media asset. For example, supplemental information may include, but is not limited to, the verification of a statement or claim in a media asset, further descriptions and/or information about objects or entities shown and/or described in a media asset, and/or any other information, including, but not limited to, a video or audio segment, that may interest a user about an event in a media asset. In some embodiments, the media application may generate supplemental information based on one or more pieces of additional information.
As used herein, “additional information” refers to any information used to generate supplemental information. For example, in an embodiment in which supplement information is the verification of a statement made by a person displayed in a media asset, and a request for the additional information from the media application includes a request for a fact needed to verify the factual basis of the statement, the additional information may be the fact used to verify the statement. For example, if an advertisement claims to have the best product on the market, the media application may use additional information such as the name of the product in question, a list of all other products in the market, and the results of a comparison study of the product in question to all other products to determine whether or not the product is actually the “best” product on the market. Additionally or alternatively, the media application may request industry and/or user reviews related to the event (e.g., reviews indicating the quality of the product). The media application may then use the information in the reviews to generate the supplemental information.
As used herein, an “event” is any action (e.g., a verbal statement, opinion and/or physical movement), segment (e.g., a portion of a news broadcast featuring a particular topic), or other occurrence during a media asset that may be of particular interest to a user. For example, in some embodiments an event may be a statement or gesture made by a character or person in a media asset affirming or denying a claim.
As referred to herein, the terms “media asset” and “content” should be understood to mean an electronically consumable user asset, such as television programming, as well as pay-per-view programs, on-demand programs (as in video-on-demand (VOD) systems), Internet content (e.g., streaming content, downloadable content, Webcasts, etc.), video clips, audio, content information, pictures, rotating images, documents, playlists, websites, articles, books, electronic books, blogs, advertisements, chat sessions, social media, applications, games, and/or any other media or multimedia and/or combination of the same. Media applications also allow users to navigate among and locate content. As referred to herein, the term “multimedia” should be understood to mean content that utilizes at least two different content forms described above, for example, text, audio, images, video, or interactivity content forms. Content may be recorded, played, displayed or accessed by user equipment devices, but can also be part of a live performance.
As referred to herein, the phrase “user equipment device,” “user equipment,” “user device,” “electronic device,” “electronic equipment,” “media equipment device,” or “media device” should be understood to mean any device for accessing the content described above, such as a television, a Smart TV, a set-top box, an integrated receiver decoder (IRD) for handling satellite television, a digital storage device, a digital media receiver (DMR), a digital media adapter (DMA), a streaming media device, a DVD player, a DVD recorder, a connected DVD, a local media server, a BLU-RAY player, a BLU-RAY recorder, a personal computer (PC), a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a WebTV box, a personal computer television (PC/TV), a PC media server, a PC media center, a hand-held computer, a stationary telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile telephone, a portable video player, a portable music player, a portable gaming machine, a smart phone, or any other television equipment, computing equipment, or wireless device, and/or combination of the same.
In some embodiments, the user equipment device may have a front facing screen and a rear facing screen, multiple front screens, or multiple angled screens. In some embodiments, the user equipment device may have a front facing camera and/or a rear facing camera. On these user equipment devices, users may be able to navigate among and locate the same content available through a television. Consequently, media may be available on these devices, as well. The media provided may be for content available only through a television, for content available only through one or more of other types of user equipment devices, or for content available both through a television and one or more of the other types of user equipment devices. The media applications may be provided as on-line applications (i.e., provided on a website), or as stand-alone applications or clients on user equipment devices. Various devices and platforms that may implement media applications are described in more detail below.
In some embodiments, a media application may transmit, to a plurality of users, a request for additional information regarding a context of an event shown in a media asset. As used herein, a “plurality of users” may include, but is not limited to any device, entity, or source of information that may process a request for additional information. For example, the plurality of users may include a person operating a user equipment device. In some embodiments, the person may receive (e.g., via e-mail, Internet posting, advertisement, or any other applicable information delivery method) the request from the media application for additional information, and in response generate a message (e.g., via a return e-mail, an answer to the Internet posting, a user input in the advertisement, or any other applicable method of transmitting information) that includes the additional information. It should be noted that in some embodiments, transmitting a request to a plurality of users may also include querying one or more databases (e.g., an Internet search engine or any other storage device, including, but not limited to, databases containing previously generated supplemental information and/or additional information) or consulting one or more data gathering services (e.g., a intelligent personal assistant application) for the additional information.
In some embodiments, a media application may use a content-recognition module or algorithm to determine the context of an event and distribute itemized tasks to multiple users in order to generate the supplemental information about the event. The content-recognition module may use object recognition techniques such as edge detection, pattern recognition, including, but not limited to, self-learning systems (e.g., neural networks), optical character recognition, on-line character recognition (including but not limited to, dynamic character recognition, real-time character recognition, intelligent character recognition), and/or any other suitable technique or method to determine the objects and/or characteristics in media assets. For example, the media application may receive media assets in the form of a video. The video may include a series of frames. For each frame of the video, the media application may use a content-recognition module or algorithm to determine the context (e.g., the person that is speaking or a facial gesture affirming or denying a statement) of an event occurring during the frame or series of frames.
In some embodiments, the content-recognition module or algorithm may also include speech recognition techniques, including but not limited to Hidden Markov Models, dynamic time warping, and/or neural networks (as described above) to translate spoken words into text. The content-recognition module may also use other techniques for processing audio and/or visual data. For example, the media application may monitor the volume of a statement in a media asset to determine the tone of the statement (e.g., a high volume may indicate an angry tone).
In addition, the media application may use multiple types of optical character recognition and/or fuzzy logic, for example, when determining the context of a keyword(s) retrieved from data (e.g., media data, translated audio data, subtitle data, user-generated data, etc.) associated with the media asset (or when cross-referencing various types of data with databases indicating the different contexts of events as described below). For example, the particular data field may be a textual data field. Using fuzzy logic, the system may determine two fields and/or values to be identical even though the substance of the data field or value (e.g., two different spellings) is not identical. In some embodiments, the system may analyze particular data fields of a data structure or media asset frame for particular values or text. The data fields could be associated with characteristics, additional information, and/or any other data required for the function of the embodiments described herein. Furthermore, the data fields could contain values (e.g., the data fields could be expressed in binary or any other suitable code or programming language).
As used herein, the “context” of an event refers to the set of circumstances or facts that surround a particular event that influence or affect the meaning of the event. For example, when determining the context of a written and/or spoken statement, the media application may determine who or what authored/stated the statement, the written and/or spoken words and/or other statements that preceded and/or followed the statement, the tone of the statement, and/or any other conditions that may alter the connotation of the statement.
FIG. 1 shows an illustrative example of a media application that may be used to display supplemental information in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. Display 100 illustrates a display on a user device displaying a media asset. Display 108 illustrates a display featuring supplemental information as described and/or generated in FIGS. 6-9. It should be noted that display 100 and display 108 may be presented on any of the devices shown in FIGS. 3-4. For example, in some embodiments, display 100 and display 108 may be displayed on user equipment 402, 404, and/or 406 (FIG. 4).
In FIG. 1, display 100 represents a display of a media asset (e.g., a streaming television program) on a user device (e.g., user equipment 402, 404, and/or 406 (FIG. 4)). Display 100 includes entity 102 and entity 104. In display 100, entity 104 is currently speaking as indicated by event 106. As shown in FIG. 1, event 106 is a statement (e.g., “We export a lot of coal”) by a person in the media asset.
In some embodiments, display 108 represents the continued display of the media asset on a user device, after a user has requested supplemental information about event 106. For example, a media application may have received a user input (e.g., via user input interface 310 (FIG. 3)) while entity 104 was speaking. Using the systems and methods described herein (e.g., FIGS. 6-9), the media application generated supplemental information 110. Supplemental information 110 represents more information about event 106.
For example, the media application (e.g., media application 206 (FIG. 2)) may have determined the context of event 106. Specifically, the media application may determine via a content-recognition module or algorithm the words spoken and/or actions by the person during the event. Additionally or alternatively, the media application may analyze the words and/or action during a predetermined amount of time (e.g., ten seconds) before and/or after the event (e.g., in order to better understand the context of the event). Furthermore, by cross-referencing the words and/or other information obtained by the content-recognition module (e.g., as discussed below in relation to FIG. 5) with a database, the content-recognition module determines that the term “we,” the person in the media asset refers to an organization or body. The content-recognition module or algorithm may also determine that the term “export” refers to shipping goods out of a country. The content-recognition module or algorithm may also determine that the term “a lot” refers to a particular numerical amount. Finally, the content-recognition module or algorithm may also determine that the term “coal” refers to a mineral of fossilized carbon.
The content-recognition module or algorithm may also determine the relationships between words and/or other information obtained by the content-recognition module. For example, by processing the relationship between the words, the media application determines that event 106 is a statement regarding a particular amount of a particular substance shipped out of a particular country. Therefore, the media application determines that the request for supplemental information is likely a request to determine the validity of the statement. The media application then generates the supplemental information.
The media application may also have stored supplemental information generated by previous requests (e.g., supplemental information generated in response to the same or different user viewing the media asset at an earlier date), and display the supplemental information again during the event (either in response to a user input requesting supplemental information or automatically without a user requesting supplemental information).
FIG. 2 shows an illustrative example of a system that may be used to generate supplemental information (e.g., supplemental information 110 (FIG. 1)) based on additional information provided by a plurality of users in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. For example, in some embodiments, system 200 may be used to generate supplemental information (e.g., supplemental information 110 (FIG. 1)) on a display (e.g., display 108 (FIG. 1)) of a user device (e.g., user equipment 402, 404, and/or 406 (FIG. 4)). It should be noted that in some embodiments, the devices shown in FIG. 2 may correspond to one or more devices in FIGS. 3-4.
FIG. 2 shows system 200. In system 200, a user is currently accessing a media asset on display 202. In some embodiments, display 202 may correspond to display 100 (FIG. 1)). During an event (e.g., event 106 (FIG. 1)) a user may have requested supplemental information about an event (e.g., event 106 (FIG. 1)) in display 202 using user device 204. Media application 206, which in some embodiments, may be implemented on user device 204 or at a remote location (e.g., supplemental information source 418 (FIG. 4)), receives the request for supplemental information.
Media application 206 determines the context of the event (e.g., who said the statement making up the event and to what the statement was referring). After determining the context of the statement, the media application may itemize into one or more tasks, additional information (e.g., facts) it requires in order to generate the supplemental information (e.g., a verification or correction of the factual basis of the statement). For example, if the event is a statement about the amount of coal that is exported from the United States (e.g., as described in relation to FIG. 1 above), media application 206 may determine the fact required to generate the supplemental information is the exact numerical amount of coal that is exported from the United States. The media application may then transmit requests for the additional information (e.g., a request for the exact numerical amount of coal that is exported from the United States) to a plurality of other users.
In FIG. 2, users operating user device 208, user device 210, and user device 212 represent a plurality of users. Having determined the additional information it requires in order to generate the supplemental information, media application 206 requests the additional information from the plurality of users. In system 200, media application 206 has transmitted the same task (e.g., the same question) to each of the plurality of users. In some embodiments, one or more of the users may receive different tasks. For example, by breaking the additional information into small, independent tasks, media application 206 may increase the speed (e.g., multiple users may work concurrently to solve different parts of a problem) and accuracy (e.g., reducing the tasks to smaller, less complex problems reduces the chance of human error) of the additional information returned by the plurality of users.
In addition, by breaking the additional information into small, independent tasks, the plurality of users may not know to what they are contributing (enhancing the privacy of the user that requested the supplemental information), however, the plurality of users can still be effective in their individual tasks. In addition, by breaking the additional information into small, independent tasks, the media application may more easily outsource the requests for additional information. For example, one or more of the tasks used to generate the additional information may be the same as one or more of the tasks used to generate other additional information (e.g., additional information used to generate different supplemental information in response to a request for supplemental information about the same or a different event issued by the same or a different user). The response to each of the request and/or the additional information may be stored (e.g., on any of the devices accessible by communications network 414 (FIG. 4)) for subsequent retrieval.
Based on the responses, transmitted as messages including the additional information, from the plurality of other users, media application 206 may generate the supplemental information (e.g., supplemental information 110 (FIG. 1)) for display to the user on the user device 204. For example, media application may aggregate, append, and/or compare the additional information in each of the messages received from the plurality of users. The supplemental information may then be generated based on the aggregated, appended, and/or compared additional information (e.g., as described in FIG. 9 below).
In some embodiments, the plurality of users may receive summary information about the event with the request for additional information. (e.g., a video clip of a portion or segment of the media asset, a textual description, etc.), which may help the plurality of users provide additional information. For example, in some embodiments, the media application may instead of (or in addition to) determining the context of an event, determine a particular portion of the event that would be needed for the plurality of users to provide additional information about the event.
For example, the media application may use progress information associated with the progress of the media asset (e.g., line 506 (FIG. 5)) to determine at what point during the progression of the media asset the event occurred, and in response, transmit a portion of the media asset beginning ten second before that point and ending ten seconds after that point. For example, if the event is a statement made by a character or person in a media asset, the media application may determine when the statement began (e.g., the point of progress of the media asset in which the statement began) and ended. The media application may then include the portion containing the entire statement (and the event) in the request for additional information sent to the plurality of users.
The selected portion may include any amount of summary information that the media application determines is necessary for the user or any one of the plurality of users to understand the main action sequence. This summary information (e.g., a portion of the media asset) may be included with the request for additional information (e.g., in a file transmitted with the request), or may be included with the generated supplemental information as a reference for the user. For example, the media application may select a segment of the play length of the media asset or a particular scene of the media asset, which includes the event, for to display to the plurality of users along with the request for additional information.
For example, if an event (e.g., a statement) was in response to a question, the media application may also determine when the question began and ended, and send the entire question (or the play length of the media asset corresponding to the question) to the plurality of users as well. After determining the portion to provide to the plurality of users (e.g., a segment including the ten seconds before and the ten seconds after the event), the media application may provide the summary information of the event and any other material needed by the plurality of users to understand the event and/or request for supplemental information from the user.
In some embodiments, a portion of the media asset containing the event, as selected by the media application, may also include any amount of the play length of the media asset, or any amount of scenes or segments from the media asset. In some embodiments, the portion may include segments of the play length of the media asset or scenes from the media asset that are not adjacent during the normal playback of the media asset. For example, in some embodiments, a portion of the media asset may include one or more sequences or scenes of interest to the plurality of users, even though the particular sequences or scenes are featured at different points in the play length of the media asset. The media application may determine the segments or scenes to include based on a content recognition file (e.g., data structure 500 (FIG. 5)) describing the media asset. For example, if a plot point or other information, which may be relevant to an event is displayed earlier in the media asset, the summary information may include a portion of the media asset displaying the plot point.
In some embodiments, the length of a portion may be determined based on the genre of the media asset. In some embodiments, the length of the portion may depend on a user profile for the user or for anyone of the plurality of users. For example, a user profile and/or a content recognition file (e.g., data structure 500 (FIG. 5)) may indicate that a particular user may require more or less additional content. For example, the user may be aware of particular characters or plot points in the media asset and, therefore, may not require the additional content to introduce those aspects.
In some embodiments, the plurality of users may receive a particular user interface, which organizes the data about the event (e.g., a clip of the actual event, summary information about the event, information about the request for supplemental information issued by the user, etc.). The interface may also include an automatic submission form, which may be used to generate a message, which is sent to the media application.
In some embodiments, the media application may also receive user input from the user requesting the supplemental information that further affects the generation of supplemental information by the media application. For example, the user may request the supplemental information includes particular information (e.g., the factual basis of a statement), may request a multimedia format of the supplemental information (e.g., textual description, a video clip, etc.), may request a form of the supplemental information (e.g., a short description about the event, an Internet link to other sources of information on the event, or a true or false designation about the event) by entering user inputs (e.g., via user input interface 310 (FIG. 3)).
It should be noted that any information or process referred to in this disclosure that is referred to as being in response to a user input may alternatively and/or additionally be performed automatically by the media application (e.g., via control circuitry 304 (FIG. 3)). For example, in some embodiments, a user may request a true or false designation (e.g., an on-screen pop-up box indicating whether an event was true or false). Additionally and/or alternatively, in some embodiments, the true or false designation may appear automatically based on predetermined settings indicating to the media application to display a true or false designation in response to detecting an event.
In some embodiments, an indicator that supplemental information has previously been generated or is currently ready to generate (e.g., a plurality of users are available) may be displayed to a user (e.g., on display 100 (FIG. 1) during the event). The indicator may also indicate the particular information, the multimedia format, and/or the form of supplemental information that is available. An indicator may also appear with the supplemental information (e.g., supplemental information 110 (FIG. 1)), which allows the user to request additional supplemental information or provide feedback/responses (e.g., rating the quality of the supplemental information) to the media application and/or plurality of users.
In some embodiments, a user may also access (e.g., via selection of an indicator and/or automatically upon the supplemental information being generated) summary information about the event. For example, in some embodiments (e.g., when the supplemental information is not generated in real-time), the media asset may have progressed to a different point by the time the supplemental information is ready for display. Therefore, the media application may need to provide a video clip of the event or other summary information, so that the user remembers about what or why the supplemental information was requested.
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an illustrative user equipment device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. It should be noted that the components shown in FIG. 3 may be used to store, receive, transmit, and/or display the media assets, additional information, and/or supplemental information as described herein. For example, media application 206 (FIG. 2) may be implemented on user equipment device 300, and may issue instructions (e.g., displaying supplemental information 110 (FIG. 1)) via control circuitry 304.
Users may access media assets and the media application (and its display screens described above and below) from one or more of their user equipment devices. FIG. 3 shows a generalized embodiment of illustrative user equipment device 300. More specific implementations of user equipment devices are discussed below in connection with FIG. 4. User equipment device 300 may receive content and data via input/output (hereinafter “I/O”) path 302. I/O path 302 may provide content (e.g., broadcast programming, on-demand programming, Internet content, content available over a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), and/or other content) and data to control circuitry 304, which includes processing circuitry 306 and storage 308. Control circuitry 304 may be used to send and receive commands, requests, and other suitable data using I/O path 302. I/O path 302 may connect control circuitry 304 (and specifically processing circuitry 306) to one or more communications paths (described below). I/O functions may be provided by one or more of these communications paths, but are shown as a single path in FIG. 3 to avoid overcomplicating the drawing.
Control circuitry 304 may be based on any suitable processing circuitry such as processing circuitry 306. As referred to herein, processing circuitry should be understood to mean circuitry based on one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, programmable logic devices, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), etc., and may include a multi-core processor (e.g., dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core, or any suitable number of cores) or supercomputer. ",['It uses a content-recognition module or algorithm.'],5567,multifieldqa_en,en,,690d6407b1ef9f8d373370bbcb02f7ecf198379774101140," While viewing media assets, users may wish to learn more information about an event. In some embodiments, a media application may use a content-recognition module to determine the context of an event in a media asset and distribute itemized tasks to multiple users in order to generate the supplemental information about the event. The use of general search terms may not provide the accuracy or precision needed by the user. The effort and time required may distract the user from the media asset. By using multiple viewpoints and/or sources, the media application enhances the completeness (e.g., by providing unbiased information) and accuracy of the supplemental info. The user may not be able to determine (even using a search engine) more information than is provided by the content producer. For example, when a statement or action is made by a character or person appearing on a television program, a user may request supplemental information. In response, theMedia application may determine thecontext of the statement and to what the statement was referring to. The Media application may collect large amounts of information in relatively short periods of time (or in real-time) and aggregate and/ or filter the information. The methods and systems described herein alleviate the need for a user to determine the proper context (e.g., who said a statement, what was the tone of the statement, when was the statement said, etc.) of an event in a media asset. In some embodiments, a media application may use multiple types of content-recognition modules and/or algorithms. The methods and system described herein increase the completeness and accuracy of the information compared to information gathered using traditional searching methods. The information can be easily displayed without distracting the user from the media asset, for example, by using a video or audio segment. The system and methods described above may be applied to, or used in accordance with, other systems, methods and/ or apparatuses. The systems and methods are described in FIG. 9 of the disclosure. The flowchart is a flowchart of illustrative steps for generating supplemental information based on additional information provided by a plurality of users. As used herein, an “event” is any action (e.g., a verbal statement, opinion and/or physical movement) that may be of particular interest to a user. Media applications also allow users to navigate among and locate content. As referred to herein, the term “multimedia” should be understood to mean content that utilizes at least two different content forms described above, for example, text, audio, images, video, or interactivity content forms. For example, in some embodiments an event may be a statement or gesture made by a character or person in a media asset affirming or denying a claim. In some embodiments, the user equipment device may have a front facing screen and a rear facing screen, multiple front screens, or multiple angled screens. The terms “media asset” and “content” mean an electronically consumable user asset, such as television programming, as well as pay-per-view programs, on-demand programs (as in video-on-demand (VOD) systems), Internet content. The media applications may be provided as on-line applications (i.e., provided on a website), or as stand-alone applications or clients on user equipment devices. The media provided may be for content available only through a television, or for content. available through one or more of other types of user equipment. devices. In some embodiments, a media application may transmit, to a plurality of users, a request for additional information regarding a context of an event shown in a media asset. The content-recognition module may use object recognition techniques such as edge detection, pattern recognition, and/or neural networks to determine the context of a video frame or series of frames. For example, a high volume in a video may indicate an angry tone. The module may also use multiple types of optical character recognition and/ or fuzzy logic, for example, when determining the context. of a keyword retrieved from data (e.g., media data, translated audio data, subtitle data, user-generated data, etc. associated with the media asset) The “context” of an event refers to the set of circumstances or facts that surround a particular event that influence or affect the meaning of the event. In some embodiments, the system may analyze particular data fields of a data structure or media asset frame for particular values or text. The data fields could be associated with characteristics, additional information, and/or any other data required for the function of the embodiments described herein. As shown in FIG. 1, event 106 is a statement (e.g., “We export a lot of coal”) by a person in the media asset. The media application may determine via a content-recognition module or algorithm the words spoken and/ or actions by the person during the event and analyze the words for a predetermined amount of time before and after the event in order to better understand the context of the events. For example, the media application might determine that the term “a lot” refers to a particular numerical amount. It should be noted that display 100 and display 108 may be presented on any of the devices shown inFIGS. 3-4. The content-recognition module or algorithm may also determine the relationships between words and/or other information obtained by the content- Recognition module. The media application may also have stored supplemental information generated by previous requests and display the information again during the event. For example, in some embodiments, system 200 may be used to generate supplemental information (e.g., supplemental information 110 (FIG. 1) on a display of a user device. It should be noted that in some. embodiments, the devices shown in FIG. 2 may correspond to one or more devices in FIGS. 3-4. The technology is described in the section entitled ""System 200"" (see FIG. 1 for an example) and the section titled ""Systems"" (""Systems"") (""System 200"") is the name of the system discussed in this section. It is also known as the ""Media Application System"" (S.A.S.C.I) and ""Media Applications System"" (""MAS"" or ""SAS"") Curacy (e.g., reducing the tasks to smaller, less complex problems reduces the chance of human error) of the additional information returned by the plurality of users. The response to each of the request and/or the additional Information may be stored ( e.g. on any of the devices accessible by communications network 414 (FIG. 4) for subsequent retrieval. The supplemental information may then be generated based on the aggregated, appended, and/ or compared additional information. The media application may instead of (or in addition to) determining the context of an event, determine a particular portion of the event that would be needed to provide additional information about the event. This summary information may be included with the request for additional information or may be used as a reference for the user. For example, if an event is a statement made by a character or person in a media asset, the media application might determine when the statement began and ended, and in response, transmit a portion of that media asset beginning ten second before and ending ten seconds after that point. so determine when the question began and ended, and send the entire question (or the play length of the media asset corresponding to the question) to the plurality of users as well. The media application may determine the segments or scenes to include based on a content recognition file (e.g., data structure 500 (FIG. 5) describing the media Asset. In some embodiments, the length of a portion may be determined based on the genre of theMedia Asset. For example, a user profile may indicate that a particular user may require more or less additional content. For. example, the user may be aware of particular characters or plot points in the media. asset and, therefore, may not require the additional content to introduce those aspects. The user may also request a form of the supplemental information ( e.g. a short description about the event, an Internet link to other sources of. information on the event), or a true or false designation about the. event. play a true or false designation in response to detecting an event. An indicator that supplemental information has previously been generated or is currently ready to generate may be displayed to a user (e.g., on display 100 (FIG. 1) during the event) The indicator may also indicate the particular information, the multimedia format, and/or the form of supplemental information that is available. Users may access media assets and the media application (and its display screens described above and below) from one or more of their user equipment devices. For example, media application 206 ( FIG. 2) may be implemented on user equipment device 300, and may issue instructions via control circuitry 304. Control circuitry 304 may be used to send and receive commands, requests, and other suitable data using I/O path 302. The components shown in FIG. 3 may be. used to store, receive, transmit, and or display the media assets, additional information, and. supplemental information as described herein."

What was the club known as before being officially renamed FC Urartu?,"Football Club Urartu (, translated Futbolayin Akumb Urartu), commonly known as Urartu, is an Armenian professional football team based in the capital Yerevan that currently plays in the Armenian Premier League. The club won the Armenian Cup three times, in 1992, 2007 and 2016. In 2013–2014, they won the Armenian Premier League for the first time in their history.

In early 2016, the Russia-based Armenian businessman Dzhevan Cheloyants became a co-owner of the club after purchasing the major part of the club shares. The club was known as FC Banants until 1 August 2019, when it was officially renamed FC Urartu.

History

Kotayk
Urartu FC were founded as FC Banants by Sarkis Israelyan on 21 January 1992 in the village of Kotayk, representing the Kotayk Province. He named the club after his native village of Banants (currently known as Bayan). Between 1992 and 1995, the club was commonly referred to as Banants Kotayk. During the 1992 season, the club won the first Armenian Cup. At the end of the 1995 transitional season, Banants suffered a financial crisis. The club owners decided that it was better to merge the club with FC Kotayk of Abovyan, rather than disband it. In 2001, Banants demerged from FC Kotayk, and was moved from Abovyan to the capital Yerevan.

Yerevan

FC Banants was relocated to Yerevan in 2001. At the beginning of 2003, Banants merged with FC Spartak Yerevan, but was able to limit the name of the new merger to FC Banants. Spartak became Banants's youth academy and later changed the name to Banants-2. Because of the merger, Banants acquired many players from Spartak Yerevan, including Samvel Melkonyan. After the merger, Banants took a more serious approach and have finished highly in the league table ever since. The club managed to lift the Armenian Cup in 2007.
Experience is making way for youth for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. The departures of most of the experienced players have left the club's future to the youth. Along with two Ukrainian players, Ugandan international, Noah Kasule, has been signed.

The club headquarters are located on Jivani Street 2 of the Malatia-Sebastia District, Yerevan.

European

Stadium

The construction of the Banants Stadium was launched in 2006 in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, with the assistance of the FIFA goal programme. It was officially opened in 2008 with a capacity of 3,600 seats. Further developments were implemented later in 2011, when the playing pitch was modernized and the capacity of the stadium was increased up to 4,860 seats (2,760 at the northern stand, 1,500 at the southern stand and 600 at the western stand).

Training centre/academy
Banants Training Centre is the club's academy base located in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan. In addition to the main stadium, the centre houses 3 full-size training pitches, mini football pitches as well as an indoor facility. The current technical director of the academy is the former Russian footballer Ilshat Faizulin.

Fans
The most active group of fans is the South West Ultras fan club, mainly composed of residents from several neighbourhoods within the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, since the club is a de facto representer of the district. Members of the fan club benefit from events organized by the club and many facilities of the Banants training centre, such as the mini football pitch, the club store and other entertainments.

Sample records for consumption influences mercury
Epidemiologic confirmation that fruit consumption influences mercury exposure in riparian communities in the Brazilian Amazon
Sousa Passos, Carlos Jose; Mergler, Donna; Fillion, Myriam; Lemire, Melanie; Mertens, Frederic; Guimaraes, Jean Remy Davee; Philibert, Aline
Since deforestation has recently been associated with increased mercury load in the Amazon, the problem of mercury exposure is now much more widespread than initially thought. A previous exploratory study suggested that fruit consumption may reduce mercury exposure. The objectives of the study were to determine the effects of fruit consumption on the relation between fish consumption and bioindicators of mercury (Hg) exposure in Amazonian fish-eating communities. A cross-sectional dietary survey based on a 7-day recall of fish and fruit consumption frequency was conducted within 13 riparian communities from the Tapajos River, Brazilian Amazon. Hair samples were collected from 449 persons, and blood samples were collected from a subset of 225, for total and inorganic mercury determination by atomic absorption spectrometry. On average, participants consumed 6.6 fish meals/week and ate 11 fruits/week. The average blood Hg (BHg) was 57.1Â±36.3 Î¼g/L (median: 55.1 Î¼g/L), and the average hair-Hg (HHg) was 16.8Â±10.3 Î¼g/g (median: 15.7 Î¼g/g). There was a positive relation between fish consumption and BHg (r=0.48; P 2 =36.0%) and HHg levels (fish: Î²=1.2, P 2 =21.0%). ANCOVA models showed that for the same number of fish meals, persons consuming fruits more frequently had significantly lower blood and HHg concentrations. For low fruit consumers, each fish meal contributed 9.8 Î¼g/L Hg increase in blood compared to only 3.3 Î¼g/L Hg increase for the high fruit consumers. In conclusion, fruit consumption may provide a protective effect for Hg exposure in Amazonian riparians. Prevention strategies that seek to maintain fish consumption while reducing Hg exposure in fish-eating communities should be pursued
Influence of mercury bioaccessibility on exposure assessment associated with consumption of cooked predatory fish in Spain.
Torres-Escribano, Silvia; Ruiz, Antonio; Barrios, Laura; VÃ©lez, Dinoraz; Montoro, Rosa
Predatory fish tend to accumulate high levels of mercury (Hg). Food safety assessment of these fish has been carried out on the raw product. However, the evaluation of the risk from Hg concentrations in raw fish might be modified if cooking and bioaccessibility (the contaminant fraction that solubilises from its matrix during gastrointestinal digestion and becomes available for intestinal absorption) were taken into account. Data on Hg bioaccessibility in raw predatory fish sold in Spain are scarce and no research on Hg bioaccessibility in cooked fish is available. The aim of the present study was to evaluate Hg bioaccessibility in various kinds of cooked predatory fish sold in Spain to estimate their health risk. Both Hg and bioaccessible Hg concentrations were analysed in raw and cooked fish (swordfish, tope shark, bonito and tuna). There were no changes in Hg concentrations during cooking. However, Hg bioaccessibility decreased significantly after cooking (42 Â± 26% in raw fish and 26 Â± 16% in cooked fish), thus reducing in swordfish and tope shark the Hg concentration to which the human organism would be exposed. In future, cooking and bioaccessibility should be considered in risk assessment of Hg concentrations in predatory fish. Copyright Â© 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.
Intake of mercury through fish consumption
Sarmani, S.B.; Kiprawi, A.Z.; Ismail, R.B.; Hassan, R.B.; Wood, A.K.; Rahman, S.A.
Fish has been known as a source of non-occupational mercury exposure to fish consuming population groups, and this is shown by the high hair mercury levels. In this study, hair samples collected from fishermen and their families, and commercial marine fishes were analyzed for mercury and methylmercury by neutron activation and gas chromatography. The results showed a correlation between hair mercury levels and fish consumption patterns. The levels of mercury found in this study were similar to those reported by other workers for fish consuming population groups worldwide. (author)
Fish consumption limit for mercury compounds
Abbas Esmaili-Sari
Full Text Available Background and objectives: Methyl mercury can carry out harmful effects on the reproductive, respiratory, and nervous system of human. Moreover, mercury is known as the most toxic heavy metal in nature. Fish and seafood consumption is the major MeHg exposure route for human. The present study tries to cover researches which have been conducted on mercury levels in 21 species of fish from Persian Gulf, Caspian Sea and Anzali Wetland during the past 6 years, and in addition to stating mercury level, it provides recommendations about the restriction of monthly fish consumption for each species separately. Material and methods: Fish samples were transferred to the laboratory and stored in refrigerator under -20oC until they were dissected. Afterwards, the muscle tissues were separated and dried. The dried samples were ground and changed into a homogenous powder and then the mercury concentration rate has been determined by advanced mercury analyzer, model 254. Results: In general, mercury contamination in fishes caught from Anzali Wetland was much more than fishes from Caspian Sea. Also, from among all studied fishes, oriental sole (Euryglossa orientalis, caught from Persian Gulf, allocated the most mercury level to itself with the rate of 5.61ml per kg., therefore, it exercises a severe consumption restriction for pregnant women and vulnerable groups. Conclusion: Based on the calculations, about 50% of fishes, mostly with short food chain, can be easily consumed during the year. However, with regard to Oriental sole (Euryglossa orientalis and shark (Carcharhinus dussumieri, caught from Persian Gulf, special consideration should be taken in their consumption. On the other hand, careful planning should be made for the high rate of fish consumption among fishing community.
Hair Mercury Concentrations and Fish Consumption Patterns in Florida Residents
Adam M. Schaefer
Full Text Available Mercury exposure through the consumption of fish and shellfish represents a significant public health concern in the United States. Recent research has demonstrated higher seafood consumption and subsequent increased risk of methylmercury exposure among subpopulations living in coastal areas. The identification of high concentrations of total mercury in blood and skin among resident Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL, a coastal estuary in Florida, alerted us to a potential public health hazard in the contiguous human population. Therefore, we analyzed hair mercury concentrations of residents living along the IRL and ascertained their sources and patterns of seafood consumption. The total mean mercury concentration for 135 residents was 1.53 Â± 1.89 Âµg/g. The concentration of hair mercury among males (2.02 Â± 2.38 Âµg/g was significantly higher than that for females (0.96 Â± 0.74 Âµg/g (p < 0.01. Log transformed hair mercury concentration was significantly associated with the frequency of total seafood consumption (p < 0.01. Individuals who reported consuming seafood once a day or more were 3.71 (95% CI 0.84â€“16.38 times more likely to have a total hair mercury concentration over 1.0 Âµg/g, which corresponds approximately to the U.S. EPA reference dose, compared to those who consumed seafood once a week or less. Hair mercury concentration was also significantly higher among individuals who obtained all or most of their seafood from local recreational sources (p < 0.01. The elevated human mercury concentrations mirror the elevated concentrations observed in resident dolphins in the same geographical region. The current study is one of the first to apply the concept of a sentinel animal to a contiguous human population.
Fish consumption and bioindicators of inorganic mercury exposure
Sousa Passos, Carlos Jose; Mergler, Donna; Lemire, Melanie; Fillion, Myriam; Guimaraes, Jean Remy Davee
Background: The direct and close relationship between fish consumption and blood and hair mercury (Hg) levels is well known, but the influence of fish consumption on inorganic mercury in blood (B-IHg) and in urine (U-Hg) is unclear. Objective: Examine the relationship between fish consumption, total, inorganic and organic blood Hg levels and urinary Hg concentration. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 171 persons from 7 riparian communities on the Tapajos River (Brazilian Amazon), with no history of inorganic Hg exposure from occupation or dental amalgams. During the rising water season in 2004, participants responded to a dietary survey, based on a seven-day recall of fish and fruit consumption frequency, and socio-demographic information was recorded. Blood and urine samples were collected. Total, organic and inorganic Hg in blood as well as U-Hg were determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Results: On average, participants consumed 7.4 fish meals/week and 8.8 fruits/week. Blood total Hg averaged 38.6 Â± 21.7 Î¼g/L, and the average percentage of B-IHg was 13.8%. Average organic Hg (MeHg) was 33.6 Â± 19.4 Î¼g/L, B-IHg was 5.0 Â± 2.6 Î¼g/L, while average U-Hg was 7.5 Â± 6.9 Î¼g/L, with 19.9% of participants presenting U-Hg levels above 10 Î¼g/L. B-IHg was highly significantly related to the number of meals of carnivorous fish, but no relation was observed with non-carnivorous fish; it was negatively related to fruit consumption, increased with age, was higher among those who were born in the Tapajos region, and varied with community. U-Hg was also significantly related to carnivorous but not non-carnivorous fish consumption, showed a tendency towards a negative relation with fruit consumption, was higher among men compared to women and higher among those born in the region. U-Hg was strongly related to I-Hg, blood methyl Hg (B-MeHg) and blood total Hg (B-THg). The Odds Ratio (OR) for U-Hg above 10 Î¼g/L for those who ate > 4 carnivorous fish
Methyl mercury exposure in Swedish women with high fish consumption

E-mail: Marika.Berglund@imm.ki.se
We studied the exposure to methyl mercury (MeHg) in 127 Swedish women of childbearing age with high consumption of various types of fish, using total mercury (T-Hg) in hair and MeHg in blood as biomarkers. Fish consumption was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), including detailed information about consumption of different fish species, reflecting average intake during 1 year. We also determined inorganic mercury (I-Hg) in blood, and selenium (Se) in serum. The average total fish consumption, as reported in the food frequency questionnaire, was approximately 4 times/week (range 1.6-19 times/week). Fish species potentially high in MeHg, included in the Swedish dietary advisories, was consumed by 79% of the women. About 10% consumed such species more than once a week, i.e., more than what is recommended. Other fish species potentially high in MeHg, not included in the Swedish dietary advisories, was consumed by 54% of the women. Eleven percent never consumed fish species potentially high in MeHg. T-Hg in hair (median 0.70 mg/kg; range 0.08-6.6 mg/kg) was associated with MeHg in blood (median 1.7 {mu}g/L; range 0.30-14 {mu}g/L; r {sub s}=0.78; p<0.001). Hair T-Hg, blood MeHg and serum Se (median 70 {mu}g/L; range 46-154 {mu}g/L) increased with increasing total fish consumption (r {sub s}=0.32; p<0.001, r {sub s}=0.37; p<0.001 and r {sub s}=0.35; p=0.002, respectively). I-Hg in blood (median 0.24 {mu}g/L; range 0.01-1.6 {mu}g/L) increased with increasing number of dental amalgam fillings. We found no statistical significant associations between the various mercury species measured and the Se concentration in serum. Hair mercury levels exceeded the levels corresponding to the EPA reference dose (RfD) of 0.1 {mu}g MeHg/kg b.w. per day in 20% of the women. Thus, there seems to be no margin of safety for neurodevelopmental effects in fetus, for women with high fish consumption unless they decrease their intake of certain fish species.

Fish Consumption and Mercury Exposure among Louisiana Recreational Anglers
Lincoln, Rebecca A; Shine, James P; Chesney, Edward J
Background: Methylmercury (MeHg) exposure assessments among average fish consumers in the U.S. may underestimate exposures among U.S. subpopulations with high intakes of regionally specific fish. Objectives: We examined relationships between fish consumption, estimated mercury (Hg) intake......, and measured Hg exposure among one such potentially highly-exposed group, recreational anglers in Louisiana USA. Methods: We surveyed 534 anglers in 2006 using interviews at boat launches and fishing tournaments combined with an internet-based survey method.

Umbilical cord blood and placental mercury, selenium and selenoprotein expression in relation to maternal fish consumption
Gilman, Christy L.; Soon, Reni; Sauvage, Lynnae; Ralston, Nicholas V.C.; Berry, Marla J.
Seafood is an important source of nutrients for fetal neurodevelopment. Most individuals are exposed to the toxic element mercury through seafood. Due to the neurotoxic effects of mercury, United States government agencies recommend no more than 340 g (12 oz) per week of seafood consumption during pregnancy. However, recent studies have shown that selenium, also abundant in seafood, can have protective effects against mercury toxicity. In this study, we analyzed mercury and selenium levels an...

Mercury exposure as a function of fish consumption in two Asian communities in coastal Virginia, USA.
Xu, Xiaoyu; Newman, Michael C
Fish consumption and associated mercury exposure were explored for two Asian-dominated church communities in coastal Virginia and compared with that of two non-Asian church communities. Seafood-consumption rates for the Chinese (36.9Â g/person/day) and Vietnamese (52.7Â g/person/day) church communities were greater than the general United States fish-consumption rate (12.8Â g/person/day). Correspondingly, hair mercury concentrations for people from the Chinese (0.52Â Âµg/g) and the Vietnamese church (1.46Â Âµg/g) were greater than the overall level for United States women (0.20Â Âµg/g) but lower than the published World Health Organization exposure threshold (14Â Âµg/g). A conventional regression model indicated a positive relationship between seafood consumption rates and hair mercury concentrations suggesting the importance of mercury exposure through seafood consumption. The annual-average daily methylmercury intake rate for the studied communities calculated by Monte Carlo simulations followed the sequence: Vietnamese communityÂ >Â Chinese communityÂ >Â non-Asian communities. Regardless, their daily methylmercury intake rates were all lower than the United States Environmental Protection Agency reference dose of 0.1Â Âµg/kg body weight-day. In conclusion, fish-consumption patterns differed among communities, which resulted in different levels of mercury exposure. The greater seafood and mercury ingestion rates of studied Asian groups compared with non-Asian groups suggest the need for specific seafood consumption advice for ethnic communities in the United States. Otherwise the health benefits from fish consumption could be perceived as trivial compared with the ill-defined risk of mercury exposure.
Feather growth influences blood mercury level of young songbirds.
Condon, Anne M; Cristol, Daniel A
Dynamics of mercury in feathers and blood of free-living songbirds is poorly understood. Nestling eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) living along the mercury-contaminated South River (Virginia, USA) had blood mercury levels an order of magnitude lower than their parents (nestling: 0.09 +/- 0.06 mg/kg [mean +/- standard deviation], n = 156; adult: 1.21 +/- 0.57 mg/kg, n = 86). To test whether this low blood mercury was the result of mercury sequestration in rapidly growing feathers, we repeatedly sampled free-living juveniles throughout the period of feather growth and molt. Mean blood mercury concentrations increased to 0.52 +/- 0.36 mg/kg (n = 44) after the completion of feather growth. Some individuals had reached adult blood mercury levels within three months of leaving the nest, but levels dropped to 0.20 +/- 0.09 mg/kg (n = 11) once the autumn molt had begun. Most studies of mercury contamination in juvenile birds have focused on recently hatched young with thousands of rapidly growing feathers. However, the highest risk period for mercury intoxication in young birds may be during the vulnerable period after fledging, when feathers no longer serve as a buffer against dietary mercury. We found that nestling blood mercury levels were not indicative of the extent of contamination because a large portion of the ingested mercury ended up in feathers. The present study demonstrates unequivocally that in songbirds blood mercury level is influenced strongly by the growth and molt of feathers.
High mercury seafood consumption associated with fatigue at specialty medical clinics on Long Island, NY
Shivam Kothari
Full Text Available We investigated the association between seafood consumption and symptoms related to potential mercury toxicity in patients presenting to specialty medical clinics at Stony Brook Medical Center on Long Island, New York. We surveyed 118 patients from Aprilâ€“August 2012 about their seafood consumption patterns, specifically how frequently they were eating each type of fish, to assess mercury exposure. We also asked about symptoms associated with mercury toxicity including depression, fatigue, balance difficulties, or tingling around the mouth. Of the 118 adults surveyed, 14 consumed high mercury seafood (tuna steak, marlin, swordfish, or shark at least weekly. This group was more likely to suffer from fatigue than other patients (pÂ =Â 0.02. Logistic regression confirmed this association of fatigue with frequent high mercury fish consumption in both unadjusted analysis (ORÂ =Â 5.53; 95% CI: 1.40â€“21.90 and analysis adjusted for age, race, sex, income, and clinic type (ORÂ =Â 7.89; 95% CI: 1.63â€“38.15. No associations were observed between fish intake and depression, balance difficulties, or tingling around the mouth. Findings suggest that fatigue may be associated with eating high mercury fish but sample size is small.

Predatory fish tend to accumulate high levels of mercury (Hg) Food safety assessment of these fish has been carried out on the raw product. However, the evaluation of the risk from Hg concentrations in raw fish might be modified if cooking and bioaccessibility (the contaminant fraction that solubilises from its matrix during gastrointestinal digestion and becomes available for intestinal absorption) were taken into account. In future, cooking andBioaccessibility should be considered in risk assessment of Hg concentration in predatory fish.

Mercury contamination in fishes caught from Anzali Wetland was much more than fishes from Caspian Sea. oriental sole (Euryglossa orientalis, caught from Persian Gulf, allocated the most mercury level to itself with the rate of 5.61ml per kg.) The levels of mercury found in this study were similar to those reported by other workers for fish consuming population groups worldwide. The elevated human mercury concentrations mirror the elevated concentrations observed in resident dolphins in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL, a coastal estuary in Florida) The identification of high concentrations of total mercury in blood and skin among resident Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) alerted us to a potential public health hazard in the contiguous human population. The total mean mercury concentration for 135 residents was 1.53 Â± 1.89 Âµg/g. Hair mercury concentration was significantly higher among individuals who obtained all or most of their seafood from local recreational sources. Study is one of the first to apply the concept of a sentinel animal to a contiguous human population. On average, participants consumed 7.4 fish meals/week and 8.8 fruits/week. Average organic Hg (MeHg) was 33.6 Â± 19.4 Î¼g/L. B-IHg was highly significantly related to the number of meals of carnivorous fish, but no relation was observed with non-carnivorous fish. Methyl mercury exposure was found in 127 Swedish women of childbearing age with high consumption of various types of fish. Eleven percent of the women consumed potentially high MeHg fish species, not included in the Swedish dietary advisories. About 10% consumed such species more than once a week, i.e., what is more than what is recommended. The average total fish consumption, as reported in the food frequency questionnaire, was approximately 4 times/week (1.6-19 times/ week) The Odds Ratio (OR) for U-Hg above 10 Î g /L for those who ate > 4 carnivorous. fish was higher among men compared to women and higher among those born in the region. We also determined the average inorganic mercury concentration in blood, and selenium in serum. Hair mercury levels exceeded the levels corresponding to the EPA reference dose (RfD) of 0.1 {mu}g MeHg/kg b.w. per day in 20% of the women. There seems to be no margin of safety for neurodevelopmental effects in fetus, for women with high fish consumption unless they decrease their intake of certain fish species. Fish consumption was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), including detailed information about consumption of different fish species, reflecting average intake during 1 year. We also determined inorganic mercury (I-Hg) in blood, and selenium (Se) in serum. The average total fish consumption, as reported in the FFQ, was approximately 4 times/week (range 1.6-19 times/ week) Fish species potentially high in MeHG, included in the Swedish dietary advisories, was consumed by 79% of women. About 10% consumed such species more than once a week, i.e., more than what is recommended. Eleven percent never consumed fish species potentiallyhigh in Mehg. We examined relationships between fish intake and estimated mercury exposure among highly-exposed anglers in Louisiana, USA. We found no statistical significant associations between the various mercury species measured and the Se concentration in Serum.

How does the scoring engine generate a stream of content for the channel?,"A system and method for generating a stream of content for a channel. The channel application includes a content categorizer, a scoring engine and a channel engine. The content categorizer categorizes new content items received from heterogeneous data sources. The channel engine identifies a channel category for a user based at least in part on at least one of a historical trend and a user activity. The scoring engine queries the new content items based on the channel category and at least one other channel attribute. The scoring engine retrieves candidate content items that include the channel category and the other channel attribute. The scoring engine then generates a stream of content from the candidate content items for the channel.
This application claims priority under 35 USC §120 to U.S. application Ser. No. 13/225,209, entitled, “Generating a Stream of Content for a Channel,” filed on Sep. 2, 2011, and claims priority under 35 USC §119(e) to U.S. Application No. 61/424,636, entitled “Scoring Stream Items with Models Based on User Interests” filed Dec. 18, 2010, the entireties of which are herein incorporated by reference.
The specification relates to a system and method for generating a stream of content for a channel. In particular, the specification relates to generating a stream of content for a channel based on user interests and historical trends.
Many consumers of digital media have two somewhat contradictory goals: keep apprised of information in the areas they already find interesting and discover new content that is also enjoyable. Keeping apprised of information can become burdensome in the digital age because there is so much information. Hence, there is a need to present the best and most relevant information, without overwhelming the consumer. Furthermore, consumers have varied interests depending on the time of a year or a day. As a result, there is also a need to cater to the time dependent changes in the consumer's interests while presenting information. Similarly, discovering new content is difficult when the consumer is overburdened with existing content.
Prior attempts to solve these problems allow consumers to create personalized sections in feed aggregation websites that are defined by keywords. Often, these personalized sections present any item that includes the keywords even though the item is not of interest to the consumer, per se. In another method, consumers are allowed to manually subscribe to Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds from multiple websites. This method often leads to the consumer viewing multiple items which contain redundant information.
In some examples, the specification describes a system and method for generating a stream of content for a channel using a channel application. The channel application includes a processing unit, a model generation engine, a scoring engine, a collaborative filtering engine, a content categorizer, a channel engine, and a user interface engine. The model generation engine generates a model that is used to determine suggestions for channels. The content categorizer categorizes new content items received from heterogeneous data sources. The channel engine identifies a channel category for a user based on at least one of a historical trend and a user activity. The historical trend is at least one of an increase in a number of new content items for a content category, an increase in a number of times one of the new content items is accessed and an event. A scoring engine queries the new content items based on the channel category and at least one other channel attribute. The scoring engine receives candidate content items that include the channel category and the at least one other channel attribute. The scoring engine then generates a stream of content from the candidate content items for the channel. The scoring engine transmits the stream of content to the channel engine, which generates a channel.
In one embodiment, the user interface engine generates a user interface for the user to define the channel category and the channel attribute. The scoring engine queries the new content items based on the user defined channel category and channel attribute and then generates the stream of content. In another embodiment, the channel engine enables the user to subscribe to an existing channel.
In one embodiment, the channel engine enables the user to share the channel with at least one of a friend of the user, a community, a group, and an internet user.
The specification is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals are used to refer to similar elements.

A system and method for generating a stream of content for a channel is described below. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the specification. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the specification. For example, the specification is described in one embodiment below with reference to user interfaces and particular hardware. However, the description applies to any type of computing device that can receive data and commands, and any peripheral devices providing services.
Some portions of the detailed descriptions that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.
It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as “processing,” “computing,” “calculating,” “determining,” “displaying,” or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.
The specification also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, flash memories including USB keys with non-volatile memory, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, each coupled to a computer system bus.
An embodiment can take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment containing both hardware and software elements. A preferred embodiment is implemented in software, which includes but is not limited to firmware, resident software, microcode, etc.
Furthermore, an embodiment can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description, a computer-usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.

The entertainment server 137 includes websites with entertaining information, such as news articles. In FIG. 1A and the remaining figures, a letter after a reference number, such as “115 a” is a reference to the element having that particular reference number. A reference number in the text without a following letter, such as “115,” is a general reference to any or all instances of the element bearing that reference number. In the illustrated embodiment, these entities are communicatively coupled via a network 105.
In one embodiment, the channel application 103 a is operable on the social network server 101, which is coupled to the network via signal line 104. The social network server 101 also contains a social network application 109 and a social graph 179. Although only one social network server 101 is shown, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that multiple social network servers 101 may be present. A social network is any type of social structure where the users are connected by a common feature, for example, Google+. The common feature includes friendship, family, work, an interest, etc. The common features are provided by one or more social networking systems, such as those included in the system 100, including explicitly-defined relationships and relationships implied by social connections with other online users, where the relationships form a social graph 179. In some examples, the social graph 179 reflects a mapping of these users and how they are related.
In another embodiment, the channel application 103 b is stored on a third-party server 107, which is connected to the network via signal line 106. The third-party server 107 includes software for generating a website (not shown). In one embodiment, the notifying application generates a user interface that is incorporated into the website.

Although only two user devices 115 a, 115 n are illustrated, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any number of user devices 115 n are available to any number of users 125 n.
The network 105 is a conventional type, wired or wireless, and may have any number of configurations such as a star configuration, token ring configuration or other configurations known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, the network 105 may comprise a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) (e.g., the Internet), and/or any other interconnected data path across which multiple devices may communicate. In yet another embodiment, the network 105 may be a peer-to-peer network. The network 105 may also be coupled to or includes portions of a telecommunications network for sending data in a variety of different communication protocols. In yet another embodiment, the network 105 includes Bluetooth communication networks or a cellular communications network for sending and receiving data such as via short messaging service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), direct data connection, WAP, email, etc. While only one network 105 is coupled to the user devices 115 a, 115 n, the social network server 101, and the third party server 107, in practice any number of networks 105 can be connected to the entities.
The channel application 103 receives data for generating a stream of content for a channel from heterogeneous data sources. In one embodiment, the channel application 103 receives data from a third-party server 107, a social network server 101, user devices 115 a, 115 n, a search server 135 that is coupled to the network 105 via signal line 136, an entertainment server 137 that is coupled to the network 105 via signal line 138, a ratings server 139 that is coupled to the network 105 via signal line 140 and an email server 141 that is coupled to the network 105 via signal line 142. In one embodiment, the search server 135 includes a search engine 143 for retrieving results that match search terms from the Internet. In one embodiment, the search engine 143 is powered by Google®. In one embodiment, the channel application 103 generates a model based on the data from the heterogeneous data sources, identifies a channel category based on a user's activities and historical trends, receives candidate content items that include the channel category from heterogeneous data sources, scores the candidate content items by comparing them to the model, and generates a stream of content for the channel.
Referring now to FIG. 1B, the channel application 103 is shown in detail. FIG. 1B is a block diagram of a computing device 200 that includes the channel application 103, a memory 237 and a processor 235. In one embodiment, the computing 200 device is a social network server 101. In another embodiment, the computing device 200 is a third party server 107. In yet another embodiment, the computing device 200 is a user device 115 a.
The processor 235 comprises an arithmetic logic unit, a microprocessor, a general purpose controller, or some other processor array to perform computations and provide electronic display signals to a display device. The processor 235 is coupled to the bus 220 for communication with the other components via signal line 236. Processor 235 processes data signals and may comprise various computing architectures including a complex instruction set computer (CISC) architecture, a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture, or an architecture implementing a combination of instruction sets. Although only a single processor is shown in FIG. 1B, multiple processors may be included. The processing capability may be limited to supporting the display of images and the capture and transmission of images. The processing capability might be enough to perform more complex tasks, including various types of feature extraction and sampling. It will be obvious to one skilled in the art that other processors, operating systems, sensors, displays, and physical configurations are possible.
The memory 237 stores instructions and/or data that may be executed by processor 235. The memory 237 is coupled to the bus 220 for communication with the other components via signal line 238. The instructions and/or data may comprise code for performing any and/or all of the techniques described herein.

In one embodiment, the memory 237 also includes a non-volatile memory or similar permanent storage device and media such as a hard disk drive, a floppy disk drive, a CD-ROM device, a DVD-ROM device, a DVD-RAM device, a DVD-RW device, a flash memory device, or some other mass storage device known in the art for storing information on a more permanent basis.
In one embodiment, the channel application 103 comprises a processing unit 202, a model generation engine 207, a scoring engine 211, a collaborative filtering engine 217, a content categorizer 250, a channel engine 240, and a user interface engine 260 that are coupled to a bus 220.
The processing unit 202 is software including routines for receiving information about a user's interests, activities and social connections and for storing the information in the memory 237. In one embodiment, the processing unit 202 is a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide the functionality described below for processing the information. In another embodiment, the processing unit 202 is stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and is accessible and executable by the processor 235. In either embodiment, the processing unit 202 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor 235, the model generation engine 207, and other components of the computing device 200 via signal line 222.
The processing unit 202 obtains information about users from user input and/or prior actions of a user across a range of heterogeneous data sources including search (such as web, video, news, maps, alerts), entertainment (such as news, video, a personalized homepage, blogs, a reader, gadget subscriptions), social activity (such as interactions through email, profile information, text messaging such as short message service (SMS), microblogs, geographical locations, comments on photos, a social graph and other social networking information), and activity on third-party sites (such as websites that provide ratings, reviews and social networks where users indicate that they approve of content). This information is obtained, for example, from a user's search history, browsing history and other interactions with the Internet. The processing unit 202 stores the information with a designation of the source of the information.
In one embodiment, there are multiple processing units 202 that each receive data from a different heterogeneous data source. In another embodiment, the user information is received by the same processing unit 202. The processing unit 202 transmits the user information to memory 237 for storage. In one embodiment, the memory 237 partitions the user information from each heterogeneous data source in a separate data storage location. In another embodiment, the user information from heterogeneous data sources is stored in the same location in the memory 237. In yet another embodiment, the memory 237 partitions the model and the stream of content into separate storage locations as well.
The model generation engine 207 is software including routines for retrieving the user information from the memory 237 and generating a model based on the user information. In one embodiment, the model generation engine 207 is a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide the functionality described below for generating the model. In another embodiment, the model generation engine 207 is stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and is accessible and executable by the processor 235. In either embodiment, the model generation engine 207 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor 235, the processing unit 202, the scoring engine 211, the channel engine 240 and other components of the computing device 200 via signal line 224.
The model generation engine 207 receives user information from a variety of sources including, for example, queries, clicks, news clicks, gadgets, email interactions, etc., extracts features from the information and generates a model based on the extracted features. The model determines the relevance of items to users, along with floating point values to indicate the extent to which the relevance holds. Examples include liking a source, a primary location and a list of interests. The interests are generated from explicit information and inferred information. Explicit information is derived, for example, from a user's list of interests on a social network or indicating that they liked a particular content item. Inferred information takes into account a user's activities.
The model generation engine 207 will infer that a user is interested in a particular subject, for example, if the subject matter appears in search terms. For example, the model generation engine 207 infers that a user who searches for information about different types of butterflies is interested in butterflies. The model generation engine 207 can even infer information based on the user's friends' activities. For example, content items that interest the user's friends might also interest the user. As a result, in one embodiment, the model includes the user's friends' interests.
In one embodiment, the model generation engine 207 also generates a model that contains several pieces of global meta-information about the user's consumption patterns including how frequently the user consumes the stream of content of a channel and global statistics on how likely the user is to reshare various types of items. Lastly, the model includes a sequence of weights and multipliers that are used to make predictions about the user's likelihood of clicking on, sharing or otherwise engaging with stream items.
The model generation engine 207 generates the model from the user information across the heterogeneous data sources. In one embodiment, the model generation engine 207 builds extensions to the model that employ the patterns of behavior of other users. For example, the model predicts the user's behavior based on the reaction of similar users. All the data that is derived from other users is anonymized before it is incorporated into the model.
In one embodiment, the model generation engine 207 generates a model based on user information, for example, based on the user's search history or third-party accounts. Alternatively, the model generation engine 207 receives periodic updates (one hour, one day, one week, etc.) from the heterogeneous data sources and in turn updates the model.
In yet another embodiment, the model generation engine 207 generates a model each time it receives a request for generating a stream of content for a channel. The advantage of this method is that the newest updates are included and the model is current. The disadvantage is that generating the model and then comparing the candidate content items to the model to generate the stream of content takes more time than comparing the candidate content items to a pre-existing model. The model generation engine 207 transmits the model to memory 237 for storage.
The content categorizer 250 is software including routines for receiving and categorizing new content items from heterogeneous sources according to at least one category and other features. In one embodiment, the content categorizer 250 is a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide the functionality described below for receiving and categorizing new content items. In another embodiment, the content categorizer 250 is stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and is accessible and executable by the processor 235. In either embodiment, the content categorizer 250 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor 235, the scoring engine 211 and other components of the computing device 200 via signal line 227.
The content categorizer 250 receives new content items from heterogeneous data sources and annotates them with specific tags, such as features, global scores, etc. In this embodiment, the heterogeneous data sources include a search engine 143, an entertainment server 137, an email server 141, a ratings server 139, a social network server 101, and a third-party server 107. Once the items are annotated, the content categorizer 250 indexes each new content item based on the features and stores the content items in the memory 237. The new content items, in one embodiment, are indexed according to an identification format (MediaType#UniqueItemID, for example, “YOUTUBE#video_id” and “NEWS#doc_id”), an item static feature column that holds an item's static features (title, content, content classification, context, etc.), an item dynamic feature column that holds an item's dynamic features (global_score, number of clicks, number of following, etc.), a source (src) static feature column where the source is a publisher of an item (magazine in news, video uploading in YouTube, etc.) and a src dynamic feature column that holds the source's dynamic features. The content categorizer 250 categorizes the new content items to make their retrieval more efficient and fast.
The channel engine 240 is software including routines for generating a channel for a user. In one embodiment, the channel engine 240 is a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide the functionality described below for generating a channel for a user. In another embodiment, the channel engine 240 is stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and is accessible and executable by the processor 235. In either embodiment, the channel engine 240 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor 235, the scoring engine 211, the model generation engine 207, the user interface engine 240, and other components of the computing device 200 via signal line 230.
In one embodiment, the channel engine 240 identifies a channel category for a user based on historical trends and the user's activities, interests and social connections. The channel engine 240 submits a request for a stream of content that includes the channel category and channel attributes to the scoring engine 211. The channel engine 240 then receives a stream of content from the scoring engine 211 and generates the channel. The generated channel is either public or private depending on the user's settings. The channel engine 240 is explained in greater detail below with regard to FIG. 3A.
The scoring engine 211 is software including routines for generating a stream of content for a channel. In one embodiment, the scoring engine 211 is a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide the functionality described below for globally scoring content items and for generating a stream of content for a channel. In another embodiment, the scoring engine 211 is stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and is accessible and executable by the processor 235. In either embodiment, the scoring engine 211 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor 235, the processing unit 202, the collaborative filtering engine 217, the model generation engine 207, the channel engine 240 and other components of the computing device 200 via signal line 228.
In one embodiment, the scoring engine 211 receives the request from the channel engine 240 and queries the new content items stored in memory 237. In another embodiment, the scoring engine 211 directly queries the heterogeneous data sources. The scoring engine 211 receives candidate content items that include the channel category and the channel attributes. The scoring engine 211 then compares the candidate content items to the model to determine whether the user would find the candidate content items interesting.
In one embodiment, the scoring engine 211 first performs the query and then compares the results to the model to determine whether the user would find them interesting. In another embodiment, these steps are performed simultaneously. In yet another embodiment, the scoring engine 211 compares candidate content items to the model and then filters the results according to the subject matter of the queries. The scoring engine 211 is explained in greater detail below with regard to FIG. 3B.
The collaborative filtering engine 217 is software including routines for generating additional candidate content items for the channel through collaborative filtering and transmitting the additional candidate content items to the scoring engine 211 that were derived from collaborative filtering. In one embodiment, the collaborative filtering engine 217 is a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide the functionality described below for generating additional candidate content items for the channel. In another embodiment, the collaborative filtering engine 217 is stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and is accessible and executable by the processor 235. In either embodiment, the collaborative filtering engine 217 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor 235, the scoring engine 211 and other components of the computing device via signal line 226.
The collaborative filtering engine 217 obtains additional candidate content items that are socially relevant from a stream of content derived from people with whom the user has a relationship and transmits them to the scoring engine 211. For example, the stream of content is derived from friends in a social network such as the social network application 109 or people that the user frequently emails. The more important that the person appears to be to the user, the more likely that the user will be interested in the candidate content item. Thus, in one embodiment, the collaborative filtering engine 217 applies a weight to candidate content items based on the social relationship of the user to the friend. For example, users that are friends receive higher weights than candidate content items from second generation friends of the user (i.e., a friend of a friend). In one embodiment, the collaborative filtering engine 217 receives information about relationships between users from the social graph 179.
The collaborative filtering engine 217 increases the weights applied to candidate content items from friends when the user positively responds to the items. For example, if the user comments on the item or indicates that the user found the item interesting, the collaborative filtering engine 217 increase the weight so that more candidate content items from the friend become part of the stream of content.
The user interface engine 260 is software including routines for generating a user interface that, when rendered on a browser, displays a channel generated for a user and enables the user to customize the channel. In one embodiment, the user interface engine 260 is a set of instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide the functionality described below for generating a user interface. In another embodiment, the user interface engine 260 is stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and is accessible and executable by the processor 235. In either embodiment, the user interface engine 260 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor 235, the channel engine 240 and other components of the computing device 200 via signal line 232.
The user interface engine 260 receives instructions from the channel engine 240 for generating a display. The user interface includes options for viewing a channel, requesting a new channel, modifying the user interests, and following suggested channels.
FIG. 2 is a high-level block diagram illustrating another embodiment of a system for generating a stream of content for a channel. In this embodiment, the components of the channel application 103 are divided among various servers so that the information is efficiently processed. The system includes a search server 135, an entertainment server 137, a ratings server 139, an email server 141, a content categorizer 250, a data storage server 265, a model server 255, a scoring server 262, a social network server 101, a user device 115, and a channel application 103.
A content categorizer 250 crawls the heterogeneous data sources (search server 135, entertainment server 137, ratings server 139, and email server 141) are crawled for new content items by the content categorizer 250 or the new content items are directly transmitted to the content categorizer 250.
The content categorizer 250 categorizes the new content items as mentioned above with regards to FIG. 1B and stores them in the database 267 of the data storage server 265. The content categorizer 240 also includes a processing unit 202 for processing user information (activities, interests and social connections). In one embodiment, the processing unit 202 stores the database 267.
In one embodiment, the data storage server 265 dynamically phases out the old content items. For example, news items expire after 24 hours, videos expire after 48 hours and feeds are kept for 24 hours or only the 10 most recent items, whichever is larger, etc.
The content categorizer 250 also transmits the new content items to the scoring server 262 for a global user ranking. The global scores are transmitted from the scoring server 262 to the data storage server 265, which stores the global scores in association with the new content items. The global scores are helpful for organizing the new content items in the data storage server 265 according to the more popular items.
Turning now to the model server 255, the model server 255 receives the user's activity, interests and social connections from the processing unit 202 or the data storage server 265. The model generation engine 207 generates a model based on user input and/or prior actions. The model server 255 transmits a model to the scoring server 262 and the channel application 103 periodically or upon request.
The channel application 103 includes a channel engine 240 and a user interface engine 260. In one embodiment, the channel engine 240 requests the model from the model server 255 and identifies a channel category that a user would find interesting. The channel engine 240 then transmits a request for a stream of content to the scoring server 262. The channel engine 240 receives the stream of content from the scoring server 262 and generates the channel. The user interface engine 260 generates a user interface for displaying a user interface that includes the channel and transmits it to the user device 115. In addition, the user interface engine 260 generates a user interface to allow the user to customize the channel or define a new channel. These user interfaces are explained in greater detail below with regard to FIGS. 4-5.
In one embodiment, the channel engine 240 transmits a query based on the channel category to the scoring server 262. The scoring server 262 queries and receives candidate content items from the data storage server 265. The scoring server 262 also queries and receives candidate content items from the social network server 101. The candidate content items from the social network server 101 are pre-scored by the collaborative filtering engine 217 and, in one embodiment, the unread candidate content items are saved to a cache on the social network server 101. These items are saved to a cache because the quantity of social updates can be large enough that performing the scoring during write time enables faster reads.
In one embodiment, the scoring engine 211 requests the model from the model server 255. The scoring server 262 then compares the candidate content items to the model and scores the candidate content items. The scoring engine 211 compares the candidate content items received from the social network server 101 to the model and rescores them according to the model. In another embodiment, the scoring engine 211 scores the candidate content items according to the category and any keywords associated with a channel. In either embodiment, the scoring engine 211 generates a stream of content based on the scored candidate content items and transmits the stream of content to the channel application 103.
Referring now to FIG. 3A, one embodiment of a channel engine 240 is shown in more detail. The channel engine 240 includes a historical analyzer 372, a category identifier 374, a subscription module 376 and a channel generator 378 that are each coupled to signal line 230.
The historical analyzer 372 is used to identify when a user will be interested in a particular category. The historical analyzer 372 identifies, for example, a time of the day or a year that a user will be interested in a category by analyzing historical trends associated with the category. In one embodiment, the historical analyzer 372 performs such analyses by measuring the increase or decrease in the number of new content items that are categorized under a content category or by measuring an increase or decrease in the number of times a new content item is accessed. For example, the number of times a tutorial on filing taxes is accessed would be very high during February-April. In another embodiment, the historical analyzer 372 also keeps track of events such as holidays, festivals, etc. Tracking such events is advantageous as, for example, many users might be interested in costume rentals during Halloween or camping during the Memorial Day and July 4th weekends.
The category identifier 374 identifies a channel category for a user based on the user's interests, activities and social connections. In one embodiment, the category identifier 374 requests the model generated by the model generation engine 207 to identify the channel category. For example, the category identifier 374 identifies sports cars as a channel category because it is an explicit interest of the user. The category identifier 374 suggests channels including a source, a category, keywords, a media type, a size of a content item, and a location for a channel. For example, for a user that is interested in foreign politics, especially relations between the United States and China, the category identifier 374 suggests the category of U.S. and Chinese relations (e.g., entity=“us_china_relations”), keywords such as trade and deficit because the user is particularly interested in the economic aspect of the relationship between China and the United States, a source such as The Economist (source=“economist.com”) because the user prefers The Economist over U.S. media outlets and the media being news articles because the user does not enjoy viewing videos.
In one embodiment, the category identifier 374 uses the analyses of the historical analyzer 374 for identifying a channel category for the user. This is advantageous as a user who has searched for US taxes might not be interested in knowing about it throughout the year, but it is beneficial for the user to have a separate channel for US taxes during the tax filing season. In yet another embodiment, the category identifier 374 uses contextual cues of the user for identifying channel categories. For example, the category identifier 374 identifies skiing in Switzerland as a channel category because winter sports is listed as an interest of the user and the user's current IP address is in Switzerland.
The subscription module 376 enables a user to subscribe to existing channels that are public. In one embodiment, the subscription module 376 enables a user to subscribe to a pre-defined channel (such as breaking news, most popular videos, updates from a social group, etc.). The channel application 103 generates the stream of content for pre-defined channels based on global scores of the new content items. Subscribing to pre-defined channels such as breaking news is advantageous as it helps the user to keep apprised of current information and discover new interests. Furthermore, because in one embodiment the breaking news channel is personalized since the content items are compared to a model for the user, the breaking news channel is more relevant than simply a list of popular or recent news items.
In another embodiment, the subscription module 376 enables a user to subscribe to another user's channel (a friend, a famous person, etc.) that is public. Subscribing to another user's channel is advantageous because, for example, a user who is interested in the stock market will benefit by viewing the stream of content that is viewed by a famous stock market analyst. In yet another embodiment, the subscription module 376 enables the user to search for channels that are public using the search engine 143. The subscription module 376, suggests such channels that are viewed by other users based on the interests of the user. In another embodiment, the subscription module 376 communicates with the collaborative filtering engine 217 to suggest channels viewed by other users with whom the user has a relationship.
The channel generator 378 submits a request for a stream of content for a channel to the scoring engine 211. The request includes the channel category identified by the category identifier 374 and channel attributes. The channel attributes include any attribute known to a person with ordinary skill in the art such as a source, presence of keywords, absence of keywords, a media type, a location, a time, a size of a content item, a date, etc. In one embodiment, the channel category and the channel attributes are defined by the user. In another embodiment, channel generator 378 defines the channel attributes for the channel category based on the user's preferences and activities. For example, if a user always reads news articles and seldom watches news videos, the channel generator 378 would define the media type for the channel as text based articles. At any point in time, the user can customize both the channel category and the channel attributes. The channel generator 378 then resubmits the request based on the changes made by the user.
In response to the request, the channel generator 378 receives a stream of content from the scoring engine 211 and generates the channel for the user. The generated channel is either public or private depending upon the user's preferences. In one embodiment, the user shares the channel to a community, a group of people or any internet user. The channel is then displayed to the user with an interface generated by the user interface engine 260.
Referring now to FIG. 3B, one embodiment of a scoring engine 211 is shown in more detail. The scoring engine 211 includes a query generator 301, a global scorer 302 and a content stream generator 304 that are each coupled to signal line 228.
The global scorer 302 is used to rank new content items that are stored in the data storage server 265 or memory 237 (depending upon the embodiment). The global scorer 302 uses signals from the different verticals to compute a global user-independent score for each item to approximate its popularity or importance within the stream that produced it. The global scorer 302 normalizes the score across streams so that items from various streams are comparable to aid in generating a quick yet reasonable ranking of items. The global score is a combination of its quality specific to the source stream (depending on the rank of the source, number of known followers of a source, etc.) and its global popularity (trigger rate on universal search, relevance to trending queries, number of clicks, long clicks received, etc.).
The global scorer 302 transmits the global score to storage where it is associated with the item. The global score helps rank the items for faster retrieval. For example, if the query generated by the query generator 301 includes a request for the top ten items about skiing, those items are already organized in the data storage server 265 or memory 237 according to the global score.
The query generator 301 receives a request for a stream of content for a channel from the channel engine 240. The query generator 301 generates a query based on the channel attributes that are included in the request. The query generator 301 queries the data storage server 265 or memory 237 depending upon the embodiment. The following is an example query generated by the query generator 301: ((Category: Politics) AND (global_score>80) AND (source: NewsWebsite) AND (media type: Text)).
The content stream generator 304 receives candidate content items that include the channel attributes. The content stream generator 304, for the above mentioned query, receives text based articles that include the channel category politics and have a global score greater than 80. Additionally, the text based articles are from the source NewsWebsite. In one embodiment, the content stream generator 304 generates the stream by ordering the content items in order of their scores. In another embodiment, the content stream generator 304 determines an interestingness of each candidate content item to the user. The content stream generator 304 determines the interestingness by comparing the candidate content items with a model generated for the user by the model generation engine 207 and scoring them.
where p is a property, that is, a setting A=a of the attributes. The latter quantity, Pr(p|user) is approximated from the user's history of interactions with content items as well as the user's search history and other opt-in data. Similarly, the former quantity, Pr(item|p) is approximated by the (suitably weighted) reciprocal of the number of items with property p (e.g., if it is expected that p=((Politics) AND (global_score>80) AND (source: NewsWebsite) AND (media type: Text)) to generate 300 items, take Pr(item|p) to be 1/300).
where the properties p are summed over single-attribute properties (as opposed to all possible settings of an entire collection of attributes), and G is an exponential function of the form G(x)=2(100 x), so that when applied in this form, if there are several values of p for which Pr(item|p) Pr(p|user) is large, the sum of their G-values slowly increases.
Once the scores are calculated, the content stream generator 304 generates a stream of content for the channel that is ordered according to the candidate content item scores. In one embodiment, only the candidate content items that exceed a certain threshold are included in the stream of content for the channel.
Turning now to the user interface engine 260, FIG. 4 is a graphic representation 400 of a user interface generated by the user interface engine 260 for displaying the stream of content of a channel. In this example, the user interface 400 also includes channels 405 that are pre-defined, channels 410 that are suggested for the user and channels 415 that are subscribed to by the user. The user can also define new channels and attributes by clicking the link 420.
The example includes the stream of content for the user's soccer channel 425. The stream of content includes news items 445, videos 450 and social network news feeds 455 from the content sources 440 defined by the user. The candidate content items are listed in decreasing order of their scores. The user interface engine 260 lists five candidate content items with the highest scores in the hot items section 430. The remaining candidate content items are listed in the other items section 435. In another embodiment, the entire stream of content is listed in a single section.
FIG. 5 is a graphic representation 500 of a user interface that is generated by the user interface engine 260 for a user to define a new channel or customize an existing channel. In this example, the user interface includes all the channel categories 505 that have been either pre-defined, suggested to the user, or subscribed by the user, and the content sources 510 for each channel category. The user customizes a channel by adding or removing content sources for the channel. In one embodiment, the user edits more advanced channel attributes such as media type, size of the content items, etc. by clicking on the link 515. The user makes the channel public, private or restricts it to a group of people by clicking on link 520. Additionally, the user can also define a new channel by adding a new channel category.
Referring now to FIGS. 6-7, various embodiments of the method of the specification will be described. FIG. 6 is a flow diagram 600 of one embodiment of a method for generating a stream of content for a channel. The channel engine 240 defines 602 a channel category and submits a request for a stream of content. The request includes channel attributes including any of a category, a source, keywords, a media type, a location, a size of a content item, and a date. The channel category is defined based on a model for a user that is generated by the model generation engine 207 or the channel is defined by a user. The scoring engine 211 receives 604 the request including the channel category and generates 606 a stream of content based on the channel category. The channel engine 240 generates 608 a channel with the stream of content and transmits it to the user.
FIG. 7 is a flow diagram 700 of another embodiment of a method for generating a stream of content for a channel. The content categorizer 250 categorizes 702 new content items that are received from heterogeneous data sources. The new content items that are received from heterogeneous data sources include, for example, news articles, microblogs, blogs, videos, photos, etc. The content categorizer 250 categorizes the content according to a category and other features. The content categorizer 250 also stores 704 the new content items in a data storage server 265 or a memory 237, depending upon the embodiment. The global scorer 302 generates 706 a global score for each new content item. The category identifier 374 identifies 708 a channel category for a user based on the user's activities and a historical trend identified by the historical analyzer 372. The user's activity includes a search (such as web, video, news, maps, alerts), entertainment (such as news, video, a personalized homepage, blogs, a reader, gadget subscriptions), social activity (such as interactions through email, profile information, text messaging such as short message service (SMS), microblog, comments on photos, a social graph, and other social networking information), and activity on third-party sites (such as websites that provide ratings, reviews and social networks where users indicate that they approve of content) In one embodiment, the category identifier 374 also uses contextual information of the user to identify the channel category.
The query generator 301 generates a query based on the channel category and the channel attributes and queries 710 the new content items stored on the data storage server 265. The content stream generator 304 receives 712 candidate content items that include the channel category and channel attributes. In one embodiment, the content stream generator 304 receives additional candidate content items from the collaborative filtering engine 217.
The content stream generator 304 scores 714 each candidate content item by comparing it to a model generated by the model generation engine 207. The score is calculated by determining an interestingness of the candidate content item to the user. The content stream generator 304 then generates 716 the stream of content based on the scores for each candidate content item. The channel engine 240 then generates 718 a channel with the stream of content and transmits it to the user.

No. 13/225,209, entitled, “Generating a Stream of Content for a Channel,” filed on Sep. 2, 2011. In particular, the specification relates to generating a stream of content for a channel based on user interests and historical trends. The channel application includes a processing unit, a model generation engine, a scoring engine, and a collaborative filtering engine. The content categorizer categorizes new content items received from heterogeneous data sources. The scoring engine retrieves candidate content items that include the channel category and the at least one other channel attribute. It then generates a stream. of content from the candidate content. items for the channel. In one embodiment, the user interface engine generates a channel for a particular channel. The application also includes a channel engine and a user interface. engine for a specific channel. For more information on this application, visit: http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/26/technology/channel-applications/index.html. nerates a user interface for the user to define the channel category. The scoring engine queries the new content items based on the user defined channel category and channel attribute and then generates the stream of content. In one embodiment, the channel engine enables theuser to share the channel with at least one of a friend of the user, a community, a group, and an internet user. The specification is illustrated by way of example in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals are used to refer to similar elements. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that discussions utilizing terms such as “processing,” “computing” and “calculating” refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device. ystem's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices. The specification also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. An embodiment can take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment containing both hardware and software elements. A social network is any type of social structure where the users are connected by a common feature, for example, Google+. The common feature includes friendship, family, work, an interest, etc. The common features are provided by one or more social networking systems, such as those included in the system 100, including explicitly-defined relationships and relationships implied by social connections with other online users. In FIG. 1A and the remaining figures, a letter after a reference number, like “115 a” is a reference to the element having that particular reference number. In the illustrated embodiment, these entities are communicatively coupled via a network 105. ing application generates a user interface that is incorporated into the website. In one embodiment, the channel application 103 receives data from a third-party server 107, a social network server 101, user devices 115 a, 115 n, a search server 135, an entertainment server 137, a ratings server 139, and an email server 141. In yet another embodiment, a computing device 200 is a user device 115 a. The processor 235 comprises an arithmetic logic unit, a microprocessor, a general purpose controller, or some other processor array to perform computations and provide electronic display signals to a display device. It is coupled to the bus 220 for communication with the other components via signal line 236. The network 105 is a conventional type, wired or wireless, and may have any number of configurations such as a star configuration, token ring configuration or other configurations known to those skilled in the art. It may also be coupled to or includes portions of a telecommunications network for sending data in a variety of different communication protocols. The channel application 103 comprises a processing unit 202, a model generation engine 207, a scoring engine 211, a collaborative filtering engine 217, a content categorizer 250, a channel engine 240, and a user interface engine 260. Although only a single processor is shown in FIG. 1B, multiple processors may be included. The processing capability may be limited to supporting the display of images and the capture and transmission of images. It will be obvious to one skilled in the art that other processors, operating systems, sensors, displays, and physical configurations are possible. The information is stored in the memory 237 of the computing device 200 and is accessible and executable by the processor 235. The memory 237 may be a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device, a static random accessMemory (SRAM)Device, flash memory, or some other memory device known in theArt for storing information on a more permanent basis. This information is obtained from a user's search history, browsing history and other interactions with the Internet. The model generation engine 207 is software including routines for retrieving the user information from the memory 237 and generating a model. The model determines the relevance of items to users, along with floating point values to indicate the extent to which the relevance holds. The interests are generated from explicit information and inferred information. For example, a user who searches for information about different types of butterflies is interested in butterflies. In another embodiment, the model generates a model each time it receives a request for generating a stream of content for a channel. The advantage of this method is that the newest updates are included and the model is current. The disadvantage is that generating the model means that the model has to be updated every time a request is made for a new stream to be generated by the engine. It also means that all the data that is derived from other users is anonymized before it is incorporated into the model. It can even infer information based on the user's friends' activities. The content categorizer 250 receives new content items from heterogeneous data sources and annotates them with specific tags, such as features, global scores, etc. The channel engine 240 identifies a channel category for a user based on historical trends and the user's activities, interests and social connections. It submits a request for a stream of content that includes the channel category and channel attributes to the scoring engine 211, which then generates the channel. The generated channel is either public or private depending on the user’s settings. In one embodiment, the model generation engine 207 transmits the model to memory 237 for storage in the computing device 200. In another embodiment, it is stored in memory 237 and is accessible and executable by the processor 235. In either embodiment,  the content categorizers 250 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the scoring engines and other components of the device 200 via signal line 227. The scoring engine is a set of instructions that provide the functionality described below for generating a channel. The scoring engine 211 is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor 235, the processing unit 202, the collaborative filtering engine 217, the model generation engine 207, the channel engine 240 and other components of the computing device 200 via signal line 228. In one embodiment, the score engine 211 receives candidate content items that include the channel category and the channel attributes. It then compares the candidate content Items to the model to determine whether the user would find them interesting. In another embodiment, it filters the results according to the subject matter of the queries. The scoring engine is explained in greater detail below with regard to FIG. 3B. The user interface engine 260 is software including routines for generating a user interface that, when rendered on a browser, displays a channel generated for a user and enables the user to customize the channel. For example, the stream of content is derived from friends in a social network such as the social network application 109 or people that the user frequently emails. FIG. 2 is a high-level block diagram illustrating another embodiment of a system for generating a stream of content for a channel. In this embodiment, the components of the channel application 103 are divided among various servers so that the information is efficiently processed. The system includes a search server 135, an entertainment server 137, a ratings server 139, an email server 141, a content categorizer 250, a data storage server 265, a model server 255, a scoring server 262, a social network server 101, a user device 115, and a channelApplication 103. The user interface includes options for viewing a channel, requesting a new channel, modifying the user interests, and following suggested channels. These user interfaces are explained in greater detail below with regard to FIGS. 4-5 and FIG. 1B and FIGs. 2-3 and 4-4 and 5 are also available for download from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The channel engine 240 includes a historical analyzer 372, a category identifier 374, a subscription module 376 and a channel generator 378 that are each coupled to signal line 230. In one embodiment, the scoring engine 211 compares the candidate content items received from the social network server 101 to the model and rescores them according to the models. In another embodiment,. the scoring engines generates a stream of content based on the scored candidate content. items and transmits the stream of. content to the channel application 103. For example, for a user that is interested in foreign. politics, especially relations between the United States and China, the category identifier. 374 suggests the category of U.S. and Chinese relations (e.g., entity=“us_china_relations”), keywords such as trade and deficit because the user is. particularly interested in the economic aspect of the relationship between China and the United. States. The category identifier identifies sports cars as a channel category because it is an explicit interest of the user. The channel application 103 generates the stream of content for pre-defined channels based on global scores of the new content items. The category identifier 374 uses contextual cues of the user for identifying channel categories. The channel generator 378 defines the channel attributes for the channel category based on the user's preferences and activities. The generated channel is either public or private depending upon the user’s preferences. In one embodiment, the user shares the channel to a community, a group of people or any internet user. The channels are then displayed to the user with an interface generated by the user interface engine 260. The subscription module 376 enables a user to subscribe to existing channels that are public. For example, a user who is interested in the stock market will benefit by viewing the stream. of content that is viewed by a famous stock market analyst. In another embodiment, a person can subscribe to another user's channel (a friend, a famous person, etc.) that is public. The global scorer 302 uses signals from the different verticals to compute a global user-independent score for each item. The global score helps rank the items for faster retrieval. In one embodiment, the content stream generator 304 determines an interestingness of each candidate content item to the user. In another embodiment, only the candidate content items that exceed a certain threshold are included in the stream of content for the channel. In this example, the user interface 400 also includes channels 405 that are pre-defined, channels 410 that are suggested for the user and channels 415 that are subscribed to by theuser. The user can also define channels 405, 410, 415 and the channel that is suggested to them. The query generator 301 queries the data storage server 265 or memory 237 depending upon the embodiment. For example, if the query includes a request for the top ten items about skiing, those items are already organized according to the global score. The content stream Generator 304 generates the stream by ordering the content items in order of their scores. New channels and attributes by clicking the link 420. The user customizes a channel by adding or removing content sources for the channel. The content categorizer 250 categorizes the content according to a category and other features. The global scorer 302 generates 706 a global score for each new content item. The category identifier identifies 708 a channel category for a user based on the user's activities and a historical trend identified by the historical analyzer 372. In one embodiment, the category identifier also uses contextual information of the user to identify the channel category. The channel engine 240 generates 608 a channel with the stream of content and transmits it to the user. The new content items that are received from heterogeneous data sources include, for example, news articles, microblogs, blogs, videos, photos, etc. It also stores 704 the newcontent items in a data storage server 265 or a memory 237, depending upon the embodiment. For more information, see FIGS. 6-7. on the data storage server 265. The content stream generator 304 receives 712 candidate content items that include the channel category and channel attributes. The channel engine 240 then generates 718 a channel with the stream of content and transmits it to the user. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the specification to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. As will be understood by those familiar with the art, the examples may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. Also, the particular naming and division of the modules, routines, features, attributes, methodologies, and other aspects are not mandatory or significant, and the mechanisms that implement the description or its features may have different names, divisions and/or formats. The disclosure is intended. to be illustrative, but not limiting, of the scope of the specification, which is set forth in the following claims. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 comprises removing pre-existing content items included in the customized stream ofcontent for the channel. The historical trend is one of an increase in a number of the new content items for a content category. The system of claim 17 is further configured to remove pre-existing content items included in the customized stream of content for the channel. The channel category is also based on an interest of the user and a connection of theuser. The user activity is an interaction of the. user with an application. This includes providing at least one of a user. preference, a user interest, a comment, a tag, and a search.r interest. The computer readable program when executed on the computer also causes the. computer to receive a request from the user to subscribe to an existing channel. It is also possible for the computer to provide the user with at least two data sources. These include a news. article post, a news feed, a social feed, an email message, a micro-blog post, an audio, an video, an. email message and a text based message. The program product of claim 9 is also called the ""computer readable program"""
When did the club win the Armenian Premier League for the first time?,"Football Club Urartu (, translated Futbolayin Akumb Urartu), commonly known as Urartu, is an Armenian professional football team based in the capital Yerevan that currently plays in the Armenian Premier League. The club won the Armenian Cup three times, in 1992, 2007 and 2016. In 2013–2014, they won the Armenian Premier League for the first time in their history.

In early 2016, the Russia-based Armenian businessman Dzhevan Cheloyants became a co-owner of the club after purchasing the major part of the club shares. The club was known as FC Banants until 1 August 2019, when it was officially renamed FC Urartu.

History

Kotayk
Urartu FC were founded as FC Banants by Sarkis Israelyan on 21 January 1992 in the village of Kotayk, representing the Kotayk Province. He named the club after his native village of Banants (currently known as Bayan). Between 1992 and 1995, the club was commonly referred to as Banants Kotayk. During the 1992 season, the club won the first Armenian Cup. At the end of the 1995 transitional season, Banants suffered a financial crisis. The club owners decided that it was better to merge the club with FC Kotayk of Abovyan, rather than disband it. In 2001, Banants demerged from FC Kotayk, and was moved from Abovyan to the capital Yerevan.

Yerevan

FC Banants was relocated to Yerevan in 2001. At the beginning of 2003, Banants merged with FC Spartak Yerevan, but was able to limit the name of the new merger to FC Banants. Spartak became Banants's youth academy and later changed the name to Banants-2. Because of the merger, Banants acquired many players from Spartak Yerevan, including Samvel Melkonyan. After the merger, Banants took a more serious approach and have finished highly in the league table ever since. The club managed to lift the Armenian Cup in 2007.
Experience is making way for youth for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. The departures of most of the experienced players have left the club's future to the youth. Along with two Ukrainian players, Ugandan international, Noah Kasule, has been signed.

The club headquarters are located on Jivani Street 2 of the Malatia-Sebastia District, Yerevan.

Stadium

The construction of the Banants Stadium was launched in 2006 in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, with the assistance of the FIFA goal programme. It was officially opened in 2008 with a capacity of 3,600 seats. Further developments were implemented later in 2011, when the playing pitch was modernized and the capacity of the stadium was increased up to 4,860 seats (2,760 at the northern stand, 1,500 at the southern stand and 600 at the western stand).

Training centre/academy
Banants Training Centre is the club's academy base located in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan. In addition to the main stadium, the centre houses 3 full-size training pitches, mini football pitches as well as an indoor facility. The current technical director of the academy is the former Russian footballer Ilshat Faizulin.

Fans
The most active group of fans is the South West Ultras fan club, mainly composed of residents from several neighbourhoods within the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, since the club is a de facto representer of the district. Members of the fan club benefit from events organized by the club and many facilities of the Banants training centre, such as the mini football pitch, the club store and other entertainments.

What is the proposed approach in this research paper?,"\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Probabilistic models have proven to be very useful in a lot of applications in signal processing where signal estimation is needed \cite{rabiner1989tutorial,arulampalam2002tutorial,ji2008bayesian}. Some of their advantages are that 1) they force the designer to specify all the assumptions of the model, 2) they provide a clear separation between the model and the algorithm used to solve it, and 3) they usually provide some measure of uncertainty about the estimation.

On the other hand, adaptive filtering is a standard approach in estimation problems when the input is received as a stream of data that is potentially non-stationary. This approach is widely understood and applied to several problems such as echo cancellation \cite{gilloire1992adaptive}, noise cancellation \cite{nelson1991active}, and channel equalization \cite{falconer2002frequency}.

Although these two approaches share some underlying relations, there are very few connections in the literature. The first important attempt in the signal processing community to relate these two fields was the connection between a linear Gaussian state-space model (i.e. Kalman filter) and the RLS filter, by Sayed and Kailath \cite{sayed1994state} and then by Haykin \emph{et al.} \cite{haykin1997adaptive}. The RLS adaptive filtering algorithm emerges naturally when one defines a particular state-space model (SSM) and then performs exact inference in that model. This approach was later exploited in \cite{van2012kernel} to design a kernel RLS algorithm based on Gaussian processes.

A first attempt to approximate the LMS filter from a probabilistic perspective was presented in \cite{park2014probabilistic}, focusing on a kernel-based implementation. The algorithm of \cite{park2014probabilistic} makes use of a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate as an approximation for the predictive step. However, this approximation does not preserve the estimate of the uncertainty in each step, therefore degrading the performance of the algorithm.

In this work, we provide a similar connection between state-space models and least-mean-squares (LMS). Our approach is based on approximating the posterior distribution with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. We show how the computation of this approximated posterior leads to a linear-complexity algorithm, comparable to the standard LMS. Similar approaches have already been developed for a variety of problems such as channel equalization using recurrent RBF neural networks \cite{cid1994recurrent}, or Bayesian forecasting \cite{harrison1999bayesian}. Here, we show the usefulness of this probabilistic approach for adaptive filtering.

The probabilistic perspective we adopt throughout this work presents two main advantages. Firstly, a novel LMS algorithm with adaptable step size emerges naturally with this approach, making it suitable for both stationary and non-stationary environments. The proposed algorithm has less free parameters than previous LMS algorithms with variable step size \cite{kwong1992variable,aboulnasr1997robust,shin2004variable}, and its parameters are easier to be tuned w.r.t. these algorithms and standard LMS. Secondly, the use of a probabilistic model provides us with an estimate of the error variance, which is useful in many applications.

Experiments with simulated and real data show the advantages of the presented approach with respect to previous works. However, we remark that the main contribution of this paper is that it opens the door to introduce more Bayesian machine learning techniques, such as variational inference and Monte Carlo sampling methods \cite{barber2012bayesian}, to adaptive filtering.\\


\section{Probabilistic Model}

Throughout this work, we assume the observation model to be linear-Gaussian with the following distribution,

\begin{equation}
p(y_k|{\bf w}_k) = \mathcal{N}(y_k;{\bf x}_k^T {\bf w}_k , \sigma_n^2),
\label{eq:mess_eq}
\end{equation}
where  $\sigma_n^2$ is the variance of the observation noise, ${\bf x}_k$ is the regression vector and ${\bf w}_k$ is the parameter vector to be sequentially estimated, both $M$-dimensional column vectors.


In a non-stationary scenario, ${\bf w}_k$ follows a dynamic process. In particular, we consider a diffusion process (random-walk model) with variance $\sigma_d^2$ for this parameter vector:


\begin{equation}
p({\bf w}_k|{\bf w}_{k-1})= \mathcal{N}({\bf w}_k;{\bf w}_{k-1}, \sigma_d^2 {\bf I}),
\label{eq:trans_eq}
\end{equation}
where $\bf I$ denotes the identity matrix. In order to initiate the recursion, we assume the following prior distribution on ${\bf w}_k$

\begin{equation}
p({\bf w}_0)= \mathcal{N}({\bf w}_0;0, \sigma_d^2{\bf I}).\nonumber
\end{equation}

\section{Exact inference in this model: Revisiting the RLS filter}

Given the described probabilistic SSM, we would like to infer the posterior probability distribution $p({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k})$.
Since all involved distributions are Gaussian, one can perform exact inference, leveraging the probability rules in a straightforward manner. The resulting probability distribution is
\begin{equation}
p({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k}) =  \mathcal{N}({\bf w}_k;{\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k}, \boldsymbol\Sigma_{k}), \nonumber
\end{equation}
in which the mean vector ${\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
{\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_k = {\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k-1} + {\bf K}_k (y_k - {\bf x}_k^T {\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k-1}){\bf x}_k, \nonumber
\end{equation}
where we have introduced the auxiliary variable
\begin{equation}
{\bf K}_k = \frac{ \left(\boldsymbol\Sigma_{k-1} + \sigma_d^2 {\bf I}\right)}{{\bf x}_k^T  \left(\boldsymbol\Sigma_{k-1} + \sigma_d^2 {\bf I}\right)  {\bf x}_k + \sigma_n^2}, \nonumber
\end{equation}
and the covariance matrix $\boldsymbol\Sigma_k$ is obtained as
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol\Sigma_k = \left( {\bf I} -  {\bf K}_k{\bf x}_k {\bf x}_k^T \right) ( \boldsymbol\Sigma_{k-1} +\sigma_d^2), \nonumber
\end{equation}
Note that the mode of $p({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k})$, i.e. the maximum-a-posteriori estimate (MAP), coincides with the RLS adaptive rule
\begin{equation}
{{\bf w}}_k^{(RLS)} = {{\bf w}}_{k-1}^{(RLS)} + {\bf K}_k (y_k - {\bf x}_k^T {{\bf w}}_{k-1}^{(RLS)}){\bf x}_k .
\label{eq:prob_rls}
\end{equation}
This rule is similar to the one introduced in \cite{haykin1997adaptive}.

Finally, note that the covariance matrix $\boldsymbol\Sigma_k$ is a measure of the uncertainty of the estimate ${\bf w}_k$ conditioned on the observed data $y_{1:k}$. Nevertheless, for many applications a single scalar summarizing the variance of the estimate could prove to be sufficiently useful. In the next section, we show how such a scalar is obtained naturally when $p({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k})$ is approximated with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. We also show that this approximation leads to an LMS-like estimation.
 


\section{Approximating the posterior distribution: LMS filter }

The proposed approach consists in approximating the posterior distribution $p({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k})$, in general a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a full covariance matrix, by an isotropic spherical Gaussian distribution 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:aprox_post}
\hat{p}({\bf w}_{k}|y_{1:k})=\mathcal{N}({\bf w}_{k};{\bf \hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k}, \hat{\sigma}_{k}^2 {\bf I} ).
\end{equation}

In order to estimate the mean and covariance of the approximate distribution $\hat{p}({\bf w}_{k}|y_{1:k})$, we propose to select those that minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to the original distribution, i.e., 

\begin{equation}
\{\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}_k,\hat{\sigma}_k\}=\arg \displaystyle{  \min_{\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}_k,\hat{\sigma}_k}} \{ D_{KL}\left(p({\bf w}_{k}|y_{1:k}))\| \hat{p}({\bf w}_{k}|y_{1:k})\right) \}. \nonumber
\end{equation}

The derivation of the corresponding minimization problem can be found in Appendix A. In particular, the optimal mean and the covariance are found as
\begin{equation}
{\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k} = {\boldsymbol\mu}_{k};~~~~~~ \hat{\sigma}_{k}^2 = \frac{{\sf Tr}\{ \boldsymbol\Sigma_k\} }{M}.
\label{eq:sigma_hat}
\end{equation}


We now show that by using \eqref{eq:aprox_post} in the recursive predictive and filtering expressions we obtain an LMS-like adaptive rule. First, let us assume that we have an approximate posterior distribution at $k-1$, $\hat{p}({\bf w}_{k-1}|y_{1:k-1}) =  \mathcal{N}({\bf w}_{k-1};\hat{\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k-1}, \hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2 {\bf I} )$. Since all involved distributions are Gaussian, the predictive distribution
is obtained as %
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{p}({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k-1}) &=& \int p({\bf w}_k|{\bf w}_{k-1}) \hat{p}({\bf w}_{k-1}|y_{1:k-1}) d{\bf w}_{k-1} \nonumber\\
&=& \mathcal{N}({\bf w}_k;{\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k|k-1}, \boldsymbol\Sigma_{k|k-1}), 
\label{eq:approx_pred}
\end{eqnarray}
where the mean vector and covariance matrix are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k|k-1} &=& \hat{\bf\boldsymbol\mu}_{k-1} \nonumber \\
\hat{\boldsymbol\Sigma}_{k|k-1} &=& (\hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2 + \sigma_d^2 ){\bf I}\nonumber.
\end{eqnarray}

From \eqref{eq:approx_pred}, the posterior distribution at time $k$ can be computed using Bayes' Theorem and standard Gaussian manipulations (see for instance \cite[Ch. 4]{murphy2012machine}). Then, we approximate the posterior $p({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k})$ with an isotropic Gaussian,
\begin{equation}
\hat{p}({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k}) =  \mathcal{N}({\bf w}_k ; {\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k}, \hat{\sigma}_k^2 {\bf I} ),\nonumber
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{eqnarray}
{\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k} &= & {\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k-1}+ \frac{ (\hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2+ \sigma_d^2)  }{(\hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2+ \sigma_d^2)  \|{\bf x}_k\|^2 + \sigma_n^2} (y_k - {\bf x}_k^T {\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k-1}){\bf x}_k  \nonumber  \\
&=& {\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k-1}+ \eta_k (y_k - {\bf x}_k^T {\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}}_{k-1}){\bf x}_k . 
\label{eq:prob_lms}
\end{eqnarray}
Note that, instead of a gain matrix ${\bf K}_k$ as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:prob_rls}, we now have a scalar gain $\eta_k$ that operates as a variable step size.


Finally, to obtain the posterior variance, which is our measure of uncertainty, we apply \eqref{eq:sigma_hat} and the trick ${\sf Tr}\{{\bf x}_k{\bf x}_k^T\}= {\bf x}_k^T{\bf x}_k= \|{\bf x}_k \|^2$,

\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\sigma}_k^2 &=& \frac{{\sf Tr}(\boldsymbol\Sigma_k)}{M} \\
&=& \frac{1}{M}{\sf Tr}\left\{ \left( {\bf I} -  \eta_k {\bf x}_k {\bf x}_k^T \right) (\hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2 +\sigma_d^2)\right\} \\
&=& \left(1 - \frac{\eta_k \|{\bf x}_k\|^2}{M}\right)(\hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2 +\sigma_d^2).
\label{eq:sig_k}
\end{eqnarray}
If MAP estimation is performed, we obtain  an adaptable step-size LMS estimation

\begin{equation}
{\bf w}_{k}^{(LMS)} = {\bf w}_{k-1}^{(LMS)} + \eta_k (y_k - {\bf x}_k^T {\bf w}_{k-1}^{(LMS)}){\bf x}_k, 	
\label{eq:lms}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\eta_k = \frac{ (\hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2+ \sigma_d^2)  }{(\hat{\sigma}_{k-1}^2+ \sigma_d^2)  \|{\bf x}_k\|^2 + \sigma_n^2}.\nonumber
\end{equation}
At this point, several interesting remarks can be made:

\begin{itemize}

\item The adaptive rule \eqref{eq:lms} has linear complexity since it does not require us to compute the full matrix $\boldsymbol\Sigma_k$.

\item For a stationary model, we have $\sigma_d^2=0$ in \eqref{eq:prob_lms} and \eqref{eq:sig_k}. In this case, the algorithm remains valid and both the step size and the error variance, $\hat{\sigma}_{k}$, vanish over time $k$. 

\item Finally, the proposed adaptable step-size LMS has only two parameters, $\sigma_d^2$ and $\sigma_n^2$, (and only one, $\sigma_n^2$, in stationary scenarios) in contrast to other variable step-size algorithms \cite{kwong1992variable,aboulnasr1997robust,shin2004variable}. More interestingly, both $\sigma_d^2$ and $\sigma_n^2$ have a clear underlying physical meaning, and they can be estimated in many cases. We will comment more about this in the next section. 
\end{itemize}



\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in both stationary and tracking experiments. In the first experiment, we estimate a fixed vector ${\bf w}^{o}$ of dimension $M=50$. The entries of the vector are independently and uniformly chosen in the range $[-1,1]$. Then, the vector is normalized so that $\|{\bf w}^o\|=1$. Regressors $\boldsymbol{x}_{k}$ are zero-mean Gaussian vectors with identity covariance matrix. The additive noise variance is such that the SNR is $20$ dB. We compare our algorithm with standard RLS and three other LMS-based algorithms: LMS, NLMS \cite{sayed2008adaptive}, VSS-LMS \cite{shin2004variable}.\footnote{The used parameters for each algorithm are: for RLS $\lambda=1$, $\epsilon^{-1}=0.01$; for LMS $\mu=0.01$; for NLMS $\mu=0.5$; and for VSS-LMS $\mu_{max}=1$, $\alpha=0.95$, $C=1e-4$.} The probabilistic LMS algorithm in \cite{park2014probabilistic} is not simulated because it is not suitable for stationary environments.

In stationary environments, the proposed algorithm has only one parameter, $\sigma^2_n$. We simulate both the scenario where we have perfectly knowledge of the amount of noise (probLMS1) and the case where the value $\sigma^2_n$ is $100$ times smaller than the actual value (probLMS2). The Mean-Square Deviation (${\sf MSD} = {\mathbb E} \| {\bf w}_0 - {\bf w}_k \|^2$), averaged out over $50$ independent simulations, is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:msd_statationary}.

\caption{Performance in terms of MSD of probabilistic LMS with both optimal (probLMS1) and suboptimal (probLMS2) compared to LMS, NLMS, VS-LMS, and RLS.}
\label{fig:msd_statationary}
\end{figure}

The performance of probabilistic LMS is close to RLS (obviously at a much lower computational cost) and largely outperforms previous variable step-size LMS algorithms proposed in the literature. Note that, when the model is stationary, i.e. $\sigma^2_d=0$ in \eqref{eq:trans_eq},  both the uncertainty $\hat{\sigma}^2_k$, and the adaptive step size $\eta_k$, vanish over time. This implies that the error tends to zero when $k$ goes to infinity. Fig. \ref{fig:msd_statationary} also shows that the proposed approach is not very sensitive to a bad choice of its only parameter, as demonstrated by the good results of probLMS2, which uses a $\sigma^2_n$ that is $100$ times smaller than the optimal value.

\newpage
In a second experiment, we test the tracking capabilities of the proposed algorithm with {real} data of a wireless MISO channel acquired in a realistic indoor scenario. More details on the setup can be found in \cite{gutierrez2011frequency}. Fig. \ref{fig_2} shows the real part of one of the channels, and the estimate of the proposed algorithm. The shaded area represents the estimated uncertainty for each prediction, i.e. $\hat{\mu}_k\pm2\hat{\sigma}_k$. Since the experimental setup does not allow us to obtain the optimal values for the parameters, we fix these parameters to their values that optimize the steady-state mean square deviation (MSD). \hbox{Table \ref{tab:table_MSD}} shows this steady-state MSD of the estimate of the MISO channel with different methods. As can be seen, the best tracking performance is obtained by standard LMS and the proposed method. 





\section{Conclusions and Opened Extensions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

{We have presented a probabilistic interpretation of the least-mean-square filter. The resulting algorithm is an adaptable step-size LMS that performs well both in stationary and tracking scenarios. Moreover, it has fewer free parameters than previous approaches and these parameters have a clear physical meaning. Finally, as stated in the introduction, one of the advantages of having a probabilistic model is that it is easily extensible:}

\begin{itemize}
\item If, instead of using an isotropic Gaussian distribution in the approximation, we used a Gaussian with diagonal covariance matrix, we would obtain a similar algorithm with different step sizes and measures of uncertainty, for each component of ${\bf w}_k$. Although this model can be more descriptive, it needs more parameters to be tuned, and the parallelism with LMS vanishes.
\item Similarly, if we substitute the transition model of \eqref{eq:trans_eq} by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, 

\begin{equation}
p({\bf w}_k|{\bf w}_{k-1})= \mathcal{N}({\bf w}_k;\lambda {\bf w}_{k-1}, \sigma_d^2), \nonumber
\label{eq:trans_eq_lambda}
\end{equation}
a similar algorithm is obtained but with a forgetting factor $\lambda$ multiplying ${\bf w}_{k-1}^{(LMS)}$ in \eqref{eq:lms}. This algorithm may have improved performance under such a kind of autoregresive dynamics of ${\bf w}_{k}$, though, again, the connection with standard LMS becomes dimmer.

\item As in \cite{park2014probabilistic}, the measurement model \eqref{eq:mess_eq} can be changed to obtain similar adaptive algorithms for classification, ordinal regression, and Dirichlet regression for compositional data. 

\item A similar approximation technique could be applied to more complex dynamical models, i.e. switching dynamical models \cite{barber2010graphical}. The derivation of efficient adaptive algorithms that explicitly take into account a switch in the dynamics of the parameters of interest is a non-trivial and open problem, though the proposed approach could be useful.

\item Finally, like standard LMS, this algorithm can be kernelized for its application in estimation under non-linear scenarios.

\end{itemize}

\section{KL divergence between a general gaussian distribution and an isotropic gaussian}
\label{sec:kl}

 We want to approximate  $p_{{\bf x}_1}(x) = \mathcal{N}({\bf x}; \boldsymbol\mu_1,\boldsymbol\Sigma_1)$ by $p_{{\bf x}_2}({\bf x}) = \mathcal{N}({\bf x}; \boldsymbol\mu_2,\sigma_2^2 {\bf I})$. In order to do so, we have to compute the parameters of $p_{{\bf x}_2}({\bf x})$, $\boldsymbol\mu_2$ and $\sigma_2^2$, that minimize the following Kullback-Leibler divergence,

\begin{eqnarray}
D_{KL}(p_{{\bf x}_1}\| p_{{\bf x}_2}) &=&\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p_{{\bf x}_1}({\bf x}) \ln{\frac{p_{{\bf x}_1}({\bf x})}{p_{{\bf x}_2}({\bf x})}}d{\bf x} \nonumber  \\
&= &  \frac{1}{2} \{ -M + {\sf Tr}(\sigma_2^{-2} {\bf I}\cdot \boldsymbol\Sigma_1^{-1})  \nonumber \\
  & &  + (\boldsymbol\mu_2 - \boldsymbol\mu_1 )^T \sigma^{-2}_2{\bf I} (\boldsymbol\mu_2 - \boldsymbol\mu_1 )  \nonumber \\
 & &   +  \ln \frac{{\sigma_2^2}^M}{\det\boldsymbol\Sigma_1} \}.  
\label{eq:divergence}
\end{eqnarray}
Using symmetry arguments, we obtain 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol\mu_2^{*} =\arg \displaystyle{  \min_{\boldsymbol\mu_2}} \{ D_{KL}(p_{{\bf x}_1}\| p_{{\bf x}_2}) \} = \boldsymbol\mu_1.
\end{equation}
Then, \eqref{eq:divergence} gets simplified into 

\begin{eqnarray}
D_{KL}(p_{{\bf x}_1}\| p_{{\bf x}_2}) = \frac{1}{2}\lbrace { -M + {\sf Tr}(\frac{\boldsymbol\Sigma_1}{\sigma_2^{2}}) + \ln \frac{\sigma_2^{2M}}{\det\boldsymbol\Sigma_1}}\rbrace.
\end{eqnarray}
The variance $\sigma_2^2$ is computed in order to minimize this Kullback-Leibler divergence as

\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_2^{2*} &=& \arg\min_{\sigma_2^2} D_{KL}(P_{x_1}\| P_{x_2}) \nonumber \\
 &=& \arg\min_{\sigma_2^2}\{ \sigma_2^{-2}{\sf Tr}\{\boldsymbol\Sigma_1\} + M\ln \sigma_2^{2} \} .
\end{eqnarray}
Deriving and making it equal zero leads to

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma_2^2} \left[ \frac{{\sf Tr}\{\boldsymbol\Sigma_1\}}{\sigma_2^{2}} + M \ln \sigma_2^{2} \right] = \left. {\frac{M}{\sigma_2^{2}}-\frac{{\sf Tr}\{\boldsymbol\Sigma_1\}}{(\sigma_2^{2})^2}}\right|_{\sigma_2^{2}=\sigma_2^{2*}}\left. =0 \right. .
\nonumber
\end{equation}
Finally, since the divergence has a single extremum in $R_+$,
\begin{equation}
\sigma_2^{2*} = \frac{{\sf Tr}\{\boldsymbol\Sigma_1\}}{M}.
\end{equation}

In order to initiate the recursion, we assume the following prior distribution. The resulting probability distribution is the maximum-a-posteriori estimate (MAP), which coincides with the RLS adaptive rule. In the next section, we show how such a scalar is obtained when such a data set is conditioned on the observed data $y_k. Nevertheless, many applications could prove to be useful to prove the estimate could be sufficiently useful to be sufficiently powerful to be of interest to a large number of people. For example, we could use it to prove that a single scalar for a single set of data could be useful for a large group of people to work with. We will also use the model to show that such scalar could be used to prove many other applications, such as in the case of a large data set with a large sample size and a large distribution of observed data. We conclude that the model can be used as a basis for a number of different types of machine-learning algorithms, for example, to predict the outcome of a test on a set of real-world data. For the purposes of this article, we will use the Bayes' Bayes test. We now show that by using the recursive predictive and filtering expressions we obtain an LMS-like adaptive rule. First, let us assume that we have an approximate posterior distribution at $k-1. Then, we approximate the posterior $p({\bf w}_k|y_{1:k})$ with an isotropic Gaussian. Finally, we apply the scalar gain, which operates as a variable step size, to obtain the measure of uncertainty, which is our measure of the posterior variance. The result is a Gaussian distribution with a gain of a gain matrix of size 1/3 of the mean vector and a covariance matrix of 2/3 the square root of the value of the gain matrix. The posterior distribution can be computed using Bayes' Theorem and standard Gaussian manipulations (see for instance \cite[Ch. 4]{murphy2012machine} for more details. For more details on the Bayes Theorem, see http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/29/science/features/bayes-theorem-predictive-prediction.html#storylink=cpy. To see the rest of the article, please visit: http://science-news.co.uk/2013-01/30/science-science-features/predicting-predicted-predictions.html. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in both stationary and tracking experiments. We compare our algorithm with standard RLS and three other LMS-based algorithms: LMS, NLMS, VS-LMS, and RLS. The performance of probabilistic LMS is close to RLS (obviously at a much lower computational cost) and largely outperforms previous variable step-size LMS algorithms proposed in the literature. We simulate both the scenario where we have perfectly knowledge of the amount of noise (probLMS1) and the case where the value $\sigma^2_n$ is $100$ times smaller than the actual value. The Mean-Square Deviation (MSD) averaged out over $50$ independent simulations is presented in Fig. 1. The algorithm is not simulated because it is not suitable for stationary environments. It also shows that the proposed approach is not very sensitive to a bad choice of its only parameter, as demonstrated by the good results of probLMS2, which uses a $100 $ smaller value than the optimal value. We conclude that when the model is stationary, i.e. both the uncertainty and adaptive step size vanish over time. This implies that the error tends to zero when $k$ goes to infinity. We have presented a probabilistic interpretation of the least-mean-square filter. Since the experimental setup does not allow us to obtain the optimal values for the parameters, we fix these parameters to their values that optimize the steady-state mean square deviation. The resulting algorithm is an adaptable step-size LMS that performs well both in stationary and tracking scenarios. The algorithm can be kernelized for its application in estimation under non-linear scenarios. A similar approximation technique could be applied to more complex dynamical models. The derivation of efficient adaptive algorithms that explicitly take into account a switch in the dynamics of the parameters of interest is a non-trivial and open problem, though the proposed approach could be useful in this case. We want to approximate  $p 1 (x) = \mathcal{N}({\bf x}; \boldsymbol\mu_2,  ‘sigma_2’, ‘’sigma’ I’;. ‘p’ (x), “p” (x) (‘x’), ’’‘”’(x),’. ’.”.’,.’., ‘;’ ‘.‘,’.’: ‘, ’,”,. ’;”, ”. ”,.”., ’,. ‘:’!’].’ The variance $sigma_2^2$ is computed in order to minimize this Kullback-Leibler divergence as $R_+$. Since the divergence has a single extremum in $R +$, making it equal zero leads to the equation: $Sigma 2 2* = M R R_R_1 + M}. The formula is: $RRR_2* = M R R_R 1 + M S S_S_1+M S-S R-S."
Does DUO contain more instances per image than COCO?,"\section{Introduction}
Underwater robot picking is to use the robot to automatically capture sea creatures like holothurian, echinus, scallop, or starfish in an open-sea farm where underwater object detection is the key technology for locating creatures. Until now, the datasets used in this community are released by the Underwater Robot Professional Contest (URPC$\protect\footnote{Underwater Robot Professional Contest: {\bf http://en.cnurpc.org}.}$) beginning from 2017, in which URPC2017 and URPC2018 are most often used for research. Unfortunately, as the information listed in Table \ref{Info}, URPC series datasets do not provide the annotation file of the test set and cannot be downloaded after the contest. 
Therefore, researchers \cite{2020arXiv200511552C,2019arXiv191103029L} first have to divide the training data into two subsets, including a new subset of training data and a new subset of testing data, and then train their proposed method and other \emph{SOTA} methods. On the one hand, training other methods results in a significant increase in workload. On the other hand, different researchers divide different datasets in different ways,

causing there is no unified benchmark to compare the performance of different algorithms.
In terms of the content of the dataset images, there are a large number of similar or duplicate images in the URPC datasets. URPC2017 only retains 15\% images after removing similar images compared to other datasets. Thus the detector trained on URPC2017 is easy to overfit and cannot reflect the real performance.
For other URPC datasets, the latter also includes images from the former, \emph{e.g.}, URPC2019 adds 2,000 new images compared to URPC2018; compared with URPC2019, URPC2020$_{ZJ}$ adds 800 new images. The URPC2020$_{DL}$ adds 1,000 new images compared to the URPC2020$_{ZJ}$. It is worth mentioning that the annotation of all datasets is incomplete; some datasets lack the starfish labels and it is easy to find error or missing labels. \cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/ZhangBHRV17} pointed out that although the CNN model has a strong fitting ability for any dataset, the existence of dirty data will significantly weaken its robustness.
Therefore, a reasonable dataset (containing a small number of similar images as well as an accurate annotation) and a corresponding recognized benchmark are urgently needed to promote community development.


To address these issues, we introduce a dataset called Detecting Underwater Objects (DUO) by collecting and re-annotating all the available underwater datasets. It contains 7,782 underwater images after deleting overly similar images and has a more accurate annotation with four types of classes (\emph{i.e.,} holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish). 
Besides, based on the MMDetection$\protect\footnote{MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. {\bf https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection}}$ \cite{chen2019mmdetection} framework, we also provide a \emph{SOTA} detector benchmark containing efficiency and accuracy indicators, providing a reference for both academic research and industrial applications. It is worth noting that JETSON AGX XAVIER$\protect\footnote{JETSON AGX XAVIER is an embedded development board produced by NVIDIA which could be deployed in an underwater robot. Please refer {\bf https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-agx-xavier-developer-kit} for more information.}$ was used to assess all the detectors in the efficiency test in order to simulate robot-embedded environment. DUO will be released in https://github.com/chongweiliu soon.

In summary, the contributions of this paper can be listed as follows.

  $\bullet$ By collecting and re-annotating all relevant datasets, we introduce a dataset called DUO with more reasonable annotations as well as a variety of underwater scenes.

  $\bullet$ We provide a corresponding benchmark of \emph{SOTA} detectors on DUO including efficiency and accuracy indicators which could be a reference for both academic research and industrial applications.

\section{Background}
In the year of 2017, underwater object detection for open-sea farming is first proposed in the target recognition track of Underwater Robot Picking Contest 2017$\protect\footnote{From 2020, the name has been changed into Underwater Robot Professional Contest which is also short for URPC.}$ (URPC2017) which aims to promote the development of theory, technology, and industry of the underwater agile robot and fill the blank of the grabbing task of the underwater agile robot. The competition sets up a target recognition track, a fixed-point grasping track, and an autonomous grasping track. The target recognition track concentrates on finding the {\bf high accuracy and efficiency} algorithm which could be used in an underwater robot for automatically grasping.

The datasets we used to generate the DUO are listed below. The detailed information has been shown in Table \ref{Info}.

  {\bf URPC2017}: It contains 17,655 images for training and 985 images for testing and the resolution of all the images is 720$\times$405. All the images are taken from 6 videos at an interval of 10 frames. However, all the videos were filmed in an artificial simulated environment and pictures from the same video look almost identical. 
  
   {\bf URPC2018}: It contains 2,901 images for training and 800 images for testing and the resolutions of the images are 586$\times$480, 704$\times$576, 720$\times$405, and 1,920$\times$1,080. The test set's annotations are not available. Besides, some images were also collected from an artificial underwater environment.
  
  {\bf URPC2019}: It contains 4,757 images for training and 1029 images for testing and the highest resolution of the images is 3,840$\times$2,160 captured by a GOPro camera. The test set's annotations are also not available and it contains images from the former contests.
  
  {\bf URPC2020$_{ZJ}$}: From 2020, the URPC will be held twice a year. It was held first in Zhanjiang, China, in April and then in Dalian, China, in August. URPC2020$_{ZJ}$ means the dataset released in the first URPC2020 and URPC2020$_{DL}$ means the dataset released in the second URPC2020. This dataset contains 5,543 images for training and 2,000 images for testing and the highest resolution of the images is 3,840$\times$2,160. The test set's annotations are also not available.
  
  {\bf URPC2020$_{DL}$}: This dataset contains 6,575 images for training and 2,400 images for testing and the highest resolution of the images is 3,840$\times$2,160. The test set's annotations are also not available.
  
  {\bf UDD \cite{2020arXiv200301446W}}: This dataset contains 1,827 images for training and 400 images for testing and the highest resolution of the images is 3,840$\times$2,160. All the images are captured by a diver and a robot in a real open-sea farm.

\section{Proposed Dataset}

\subsection{Image Deduplicating}
As we explained in Section 1, there are a large number of similar or repeated images in the series of URPC datasets. Therefore, it is important to delete duplicate or overly similar images and keep a variety of underwater scenarios when we merge these datasets together. Here we employ the Perceptual Hash algorithm (PHash) to remove those images. PHash has the special property that the hash value is dependent on the image content, and it remains approximately the same if the content is not significantly modified. Thus we can easily distinguish different scenarios and delete duplicate images within one scenario. 

After deduplicating, we obtain 7,782 images (6,671 images for training; 1,111 for testing). The retention rate of the new dataset is 95\%, which means that there are only a few similar images in the new dataset. Figure \ref{exam} shows that our dataset also retains various underwater scenes.

\subsection{Image Re-annotation}
Due to the small size of objects and the blur underwater environment, there are always missing or wrong labels in the existing annotation files. In addition, some test sets' annotation files are not available and some datasets do not have the starfish annotation. In order to address these issues, we follow the next process which combines a CNN model and manual annotation to re-annotate these images. Specifically, we first train a detector (\emph{i.e.,} GFL \cite{li2020generalized}) with the originally labeled images. After that, the trained detector predicts all the 7,782 images. We treat the prediction as the groundtruth and use it to train the GFL again. We get the final GFL prediction called {\bf the coarse annotation}. Next, we use manual correction to get the final annotation called {\bf the fine annotation}. Notably, we adopt the COCO \cite{Belongie2014} annotation form as the final format.
\subsection{Dataset Statistics}
{\bf The proportion of classes}: The total number of objects is 74,515. Holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish are 7,887, 50,156, 1,924, and 14,548, respectively. Figure \ref{pie} shows the proportion of each creatures where echinus accounts for 67.3\% of the total. The whole data distribution shows an obvious long-tail distribution because the different economic benefits of different seafoods determine the different breed quantities.

{\bf The distribution of instance sizes}: Figure \ref{sum}(a) shows an instance size distribution of DUO. \emph{Percent of image size} represents the ratio of object area to image area, and \emph{Percent of instance} represents the ratio of the corresponding number of objects to the total number of objects. Because of these small creatures and high-resolution images, the vast majority of objects occupy 0.3\% to 1.5\% of the image area.

{\bf The instance number per image}: Figure \ref{sum}(b) illustrates the number of categories per image for DUO. \emph{Number of instances} represents the number of objects one image has, and \emph{ Percentage of images} represents the ratio of the corresponding number of images to the total number of images. Most images contain between 5 and 15 instances, with an average of 9.57 instances per image.

{\bf Summary}:
In general, smaller objects are harder to detect. For PASCAL VOC \cite{Everingham2007The} or COCO \cite{Belongie2014}, roughly 50\% of all objects occupy no more than 10\% of the image itself, and others evenly occupy from 10\% to 100\%. 
In the aspect of instances number per image, COCO contains 7.7 instances per image and VOC contains 3. In comparison, DUO has 9.57 instances per image and most instances less than 1.5\% of the image size.
Therefore, DUO contains almost exclusively massive small instances and has the long-tail distribution at the same time, which means it is promising to design a detector to deal with massive small objects and stay high efficiency at the same time for underwater robot picking.

\section{Benchmark}
Because the aim of underwater object detection for robot picking is to find {\bf the high accuracy and efficiency} algorithm, we consider both the accuracy and efficiency evaluations in the benchmark as shown in Table \ref{ben}.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
Here we adopt the standard COCO metrics (mean average precision, \emph{i.e.,} mAP) for the accuracy evaluation and also provide the mAP of each class due to the long-tail distribution.

{\bf AP} -- mAP at IoU=0.50:0.05:0.95.

{\bf AP$_{50}$} --  mAP at IoU=0.50.

{\bf AP$_{75}$} --  mAP at IoU=0.75. 

{\bf AP$_{S}$} --   {\bf AP} for small objects of area smaller than 32$^{2}$.

{\bf AP$_{M}$} --   {\bf AP} for objects of area between 32$^{2}$ and 96$^{2}$.

{\bf AP$_{L}$} --   {\bf AP} for large objects of area bigger than 96$^{2}$.

{\bf AP$_{Ho}$} --  {\bf AP} in holothurian.

{\bf AP$_{Ec}$} --  {\bf AP} in echinus.

{\bf AP$_{Sc}$} --  {\bf AP} in scallop.

{\bf AP$_{St}$} --  {\bf AP} in starfish.


For the efficiency evaluation, we provide three metrics:

{\bf Param.} --  The parameters of a detector.

{\bf FLOPs} --  Floating-point operations per second.

{\bf FPS} --  Frames per second.

Notably, {\bf FLOPs} is calculated under the 512$\times$512 input image size and {\bf FPS} is tested on a JETSON AGX XAVIER under MODE$\_$30W$\_$ALL. 

\subsection{Standard Training Configuration}
We follow a widely used open-source toolbox, \emph{i.e.,} MMDetection (V2.5.0) to produce up our benchmark. During the training, the standard configurations are as follows:

  $\bullet$ We initialize the backbone models (\emph{e.g.,} ResNet50) with pre-trained parameters on ImageNet \cite{Deng2009ImageNet}.

  $\bullet$ We resize each image into 512 $\times$ 512 pixels both in training and testing. Each image is flipped horizontally with 0.5 probability during training.

  $\bullet$ We normalize RGB channels by subtracting 123.675, 116.28, 103.53 and dividing by 58.395, 57.12, 57.375, respectively.

  $\bullet$ SGD method is adopted to optimize the model. The initial learning rate is set to be 0.005 in a single GTX 1080Ti with batchsize 4 and is decreased by 0.1 at the 8th and 11th epoch, respectively. WarmUp \cite{2019arXiv190307071L} is also employed in the first 500 iterations. Totally there are 12 training epochs.

  $\bullet$ Testing time augmentation (\emph{i.e.,} flipping test or multi-scale testing) is not employed.



\subsection{Benchmark Analysis}
Table \ref{ben} shows the benchmark for the \emph{SOTA} methods. Multi- and one- stage detectors with three kinds of backbones (\emph{i.e.,} ResNet18, 50, 101) give a comprehensive assessment on DUO. We also deploy all the methods to AGX to assess efficiency.

In general, the multi-stage (Cascade R-CNN) detectors have high accuracy and low efficiency, while the one-stage (RetinaNet) detectors have low accuracy and high efficiency. However, due to recent studies \cite{zhang2019bridging} on the allocation of more reasonable positive and negative samples in training, one-stage detectors (ATSS or GFL) can achieve both high accuracy and high efficiency.

Therefore, in terms of accuracy, the accuracy difference between the multi- and the one- stage methods in AP is not obvious, and the AP$_{S}$ of different methods is always the lowest among the three size AP. For class AP, AP$_{Sc}$ lags significantly behind the other three classes because it has the smallest number of instances. In terms of efficiency, large parameters and FLOPs result in low FPS on AGX, with a maximum FPS of 7.4, which is hardly deployable on underwater robot. Finally, we also found that ResNet101 was not significantly improved over ResNet50, which means that a very deep network may not be useful for detecting small creatures in underwater scenarios. 

Consequently, the design of high accuracy and high efficiency detector is still the main direction in this field and there is still large space to improve the performance.
In order to achieve this goal, a shallow backbone with strong multi-scale feature fusion ability can be proposed to extract the discriminant features of small scale aquatic organisms; a specially designed training strategy may overcome the DUO's long-tail distribution, such as a more reasonable positive/negative label sampling mechanism or a class-balanced image allocation strategy within a training batch.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce a dataset (DUO) and a corresponding benchmark to fill in the gaps in the community. DUO contains a variety of underwater scenes and more reasonable annotations. Benchmark includes efficiency and accuracy indicators to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the \emph{SOTA} decoders. The two contributions could serve as a reference for academic research and industrial applications, as well as promote community development.","['Yes, DUO has 9.57 instances per image while COCO contains 7.7.']",2619,multifieldqa_en,en,,dffb383ee06d8413ac40e2c1ec7bde5548ef07fc8f35ad2f," Underwater robot picking is to use the robot to automatically capture sea creatures like holothurian, echinus, scallop, or starfish in an open-sea farm. Until now, the datasets used in this community are released by the Underwater Robot Professional Contest. There are a large number of similar or duplicate images in the URPC datasets. There is no unified benchmark to compare the performance of different algorithms. To address these issues, we introduce a dataset called Detecting Underwater Objects (DUO) It contains 7782 images after deleting all the underwater images after the contest. It contains a small number of images as well as an accurate annotation and a corresponding benchmark are urgently needed to promote development of the DUO community. It is worth mentioning that the annotation of all datasets is incomplete; the starfish labels of the new datasets is the only part of the dataset that is not missing. The dataset is free to download and can be downloaded by any researcher. It has been released to the public for the first time in the U.S. and is available for download in the UK and Europe. It was released to all researchers for free in the EU and the UK in the first week of January 2019. It will be available in the US in the second week of February 2019. This paper presents a dataset called DUO with more reasonable annotations as well as a variety of underwater scenes. DUO will be released in https://github.com/chongweiliu soon. We provide a benchmark of SOTA detectors on DUO including efficiency and accuracy indicators which could be a reference for both academic research and industrial applications. It is worth noting that JETSON AGX XAVIER is an embedded development board produced by NVIDIA that could be deployed in an underwater robot. All the images are captured by a diver and a real open-sea farm and are taken from 6 videos at an interval of 10 frames. However, all the videos were filmed in an artificial simulated environment and pictures from the same video look almost identical. The test set's annotations are also not available and it contains images from the former contests. The detailed information has been shown in Table \ref{Info}. It contains 17,655 images for training and 985 images for testing and the resolution of all the images is 720$\times$405. It contains 5,543 images forTraining and 2,000 images forTesting and the highest resolution of the pictures is 3,840$\ times$2,160. There are a large number of similar or repeated images in the series of URPC datasets. It is important to delete duplicate or overly similar images and keep a variety of underwater scenarios when we merge these datasets together. After deduplicating, we obtain 7,782 images (6,671 images for training; 1,111 for testing) The retention rate of the new dataset is 95\%, which means that there are only a few similar images. The total number of objects is 74,515. Holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish are 7,887, 50,156, 1,924, and 14,548, respectively. Because of these small creatures and high-resolution images, the vast majority of objects occupy 0.3\% to 1.5\% of the image area. Most images contain between 5 and 15 instances with an average of 9.57 instances per image. For general, general, and general, smaller objects are harder to detect. For COCO, roughly 50% of all objects occupy no more than 10\%. than the image itself, and others evenly from 10 to 100%. For POCAL, roughly 77 instances per image, COCOCO contains 7.7 inst instances. Duo has 9.57 instances per image and most instances less than 1.5\% of the image size. DUO contains almost exclusively massive small instances and has the long-tail distribution at the same time. This means it is promising to design a detector to deal with massive small objects and stay high efficiency at theSame time for underwater robot picking. However, recent studies have low accuracy and high efficiency, due to the positive and negative allocation of samples in more reasonable and negative samples. We also deploy all the methods to assess efficiency to AGX XAVIER in general, the multi-stage (Cascade R-Cascade) and one-stage detectors in particular. We follow a widely used open-source toolbox, \emph{i.e.,} MMDetection (V2.5.0) to produce up our benchmark. The initial learning rate is set to be 0.005 in a single GTX 1080Ti with batchsize 4 and is decreased by 0.1 at the 8th and 11th epoch, respectively. During the training, the standard configurations are as follows: We resize each image into 512 pixels both in training and testing. Each image is flipped horizontally with 0.5 probability during training. We normalize RGB channels by subtracting 123.675, 116.28, 103.53 and dividing by 58.395, 57.12, 57375, respectively, to optimize the model.

What are the symptoms of vitamin K deficiency?,"Vitamin K - Wikipedia

This article is about the family of vitamers. For vitamin K1 the form usually used as a supplement, see Phytomenadione.
Vitamin K structures. MK-4 and MK-7 are both subtypes of K2.
Vitamin K deficiency, Warfarin overdose
Vitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins the human body requires for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are prerequisites for blood coagulation and which the body also needs for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues. The vitamin K-related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Low levels of vitamin K also weaken bones and promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues[citation needed].
Chemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 and vitamin K2.[1] Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms.
Vitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It may be thought of as the plant form of vitamin K. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2.
Bacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into vitamin K2. In addition, bacteria typically lengthen the isoprenoid side chain of vitamin K2 to produce a range of vitamin K2 forms, most notably the MK-7 to MK-11 homologues of vitamin K2. All forms of K2 other than MK-4 can only be produced by bacteria, which use these forms in anaerobic respiration. The MK-7 and other bacterially derived forms of vitamin K2 exhibit vitamin K activity in animals, but MK-7's extra utility over MK-4, if any, is unclear and is a matter of investigation.
Three synthetic types of vitamin K are known: vitamins K3, K4, and K5. Although the natural K1 and all K2 homologues and synthetic K4 and K5 have proven nontoxic, the synthetic form K3 (menadione) has shown toxicity.[2]

11.3 Controversy
A review of 2014 concluded that there is positive evidence that monotherapy using MK-4, one of the forms of Vitamin K2, reduces fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, and suggested further research on the combined use of MK-4 with bisphosphonates. In contrast, an earlier review article of 2013 concluded that there is no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation helps prevent osteoporosis or fractures in postmenopausal women.[3]
A Cochrane systematic review of 2006 suggested that supplementation with Vitamin K1 and with MK4 reduces bone loss; in particular, a strong effect of MK-4 on incident fractures among Japanese patients was emphasized.[4]
A review article of 2016 suggested to consider, as one of several measures for bone health, increasing the intake of foods rich in vitamins K1 and K2.[5]
Cardiovascular health[edit]
Adequate intake of vitamin K is associated with the inhibition of arterial calcification and stiffening,[6] but there have been few interventional studies and no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation is of any benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.[7]
One 10-year population study, the Rotterdam Study, did show a clear and significant inverse relationship between the highest intake levels of menaquinone (mainly MK-4 from eggs and meat, and MK-8 and MK-9 from cheese) and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in older men and women.[8]
Vitamin K has been promoted in supplement form with claims it can slow tumor growth; there is however no good medical evidence that supports such claims.[9]
Coumarin poisoning[edit]
Vitamin K is part of the suggested treatment regime for poisoning by rodenticide (coumarin poisoning).[10]
Although allergic reaction from supplementation is possible, no known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K, so no tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set.[11]
Blood clotting (coagulation) studies in humans using 45 mg per day of vitamin K2 (as MK-4)[12] and even up to 135 mg per day (45 mg three times daily) of K2 (as MK-4),[13] showed no increase in blood clot risk. Even doses in rats as high as 250 mg/kg, body weight did not alter the tendency for blood-clot formation to occur.[14]
Unlike the safe natural forms of vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 and their various isomers, a synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), is demonstrably toxic at high levels. The U.S. FDA has banned this form from over-the-counter sale in the United States because large doses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells.[2]
Phylloquinone (K1)[15][16] or menaquinone (K2) are capable of reversing the anticoagulant activity of the anticoagulant warfarin (tradename Coumadin). Warfarin works by blocking recycling of vitamin K, so that the body and tissues have lower levels of active vitamin K, and thus a deficiency of vitamin K.
Supplemental vitamin K (for which oral dosing is often more active than injectable dosing in human adults) reverses the vitamin K deficiency caused by warfarin, and therefore reduces the intended anticoagulant action of warfarin and related drugs.[17] Sometimes small amounts of vitamin K are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable.[17] The proper anticoagulant action of the drug is a function of vitamin K intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient.[citation needed] The action of warfarin and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect, and neither warfarin or vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given.[18]
The newer anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have different mechanisms of action that do not interact with vitamin K, and may be taken with supplemental vitamin K.[19][20]
Vitamin K2 (menaquinone). In menaquinone, the side chain is composed of a varying number of isoprenoid residues. The most common number of these residues is four, since animal enzymes normally produce menaquinone-4 from plant phylloquinone.
A sample of phytomenadione for injection, also called phylloquinone
The three synthetic forms of vitamin K are vitamins K3 (menadione), K4, and K5, which are used in many areas, including the pet food industry (vitamin K3) and to inhibit fungal growth (vitamin K5).[21]
Conversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2[edit]
Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) – both forms of the vitamin contain a functional naphthoquinone ring and an aliphatic side chain. Phylloquinone has a phytyl side chain.
The MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls.[22] While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in germ-free rats[23][24] and in parenterally-administered K1 in rats.[25][26] In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4.[27][28] There is evidence that the conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also prenylation) to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrione) form.[29]
Vitamin K2[edit]
Main article: Vitamin K2
Vitamin K2 (menaquinone) includes several subtypes. The two subtypes most studied are menaquinone-4 (menatetrenone, MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7).
Vitamin K1, the precursor of most vitamin K in nature, is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants, where it functions as an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis. For this reason, vitamin K1 is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.). Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. The function of phylloquinone in plants appears to have no resemblance to its later metabolic and biochemical function (as ""vitamin K"") in animals, where it performs a completely different biochemical reaction.
Vitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are often (but not always) situated within specific protein domains called Gla domains. Gla residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins.[30]
At this time[update], 17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered, and they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes:
Blood coagulation: prothrombin (factor II), factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C, S, and Z[31]
Bone metabolism: osteocalcin, also called bone Gla protein (BGP), matrix Gla protein (MGP),[32] periostin,[33] and the recently discovered Gla-rich protein (GRP).[34][35]
Vascular biology: growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6)[36]
Unknown function: proline-rich γ-carboxyglutamyl proteins (PRGPs) 1 and 2, and transmembrane γ-carboxy glutamyl proteins (TMGs) 3 and 4.[37]
Like other lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D and E), vitamin K is stored in the fatty tissue of the human body.
Absorption and dietary need[edit]
Previous theory held that dietary deficiency is extremely rare unless the small intestine was heavily damaged, resulting in malabsorption of the molecule. Another at-risk group for deficiency were those subject to decreased production of K2 by normal intestinal microbiota, as seen in broad spectrum antibiotic use.[38] Taking broad-spectrum antibiotics can reduce vitamin K production in the gut by nearly 74% in people compared with those not taking these antibiotics.[39] Diets low in vitamin K also decrease the body's vitamin K concentration.[40] Those with chronic kidney disease are at risk for vitamin K deficiency, as well as vitamin D deficiency, and particularly those with the apoE4 genotype.[41] Additionally, in the elderly there is a reduction in vitamin K2 production.[42]
The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) updated an estimate of what constitutes an adequate intake (AI) for vitamin K in 2001. The NAM does not distinguish between K1 and K2 – both are counted as vitamin K. At that time there was not sufficient evidence to set the more rigorous estimated average requirement (EAR) or recommended dietary allowance (RDA) given for most of the essential vitamins and minerals. The current daily AIs for vitamin K for adult women and men are 90 μg and 120 μg respectively. The AI for pregnancy and lactation is 90 μg. For infants up to 12 months the AI is 2–2.5 μg, and for children aged 1 to 18 years the AI increases with age from 30 to 75 μg. As for safety, the FNB also sets tolerable upper intake levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of vitamin K no UL is set, as evidence for adverse effects is not sufficient. Collectively EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as dietary reference intakes.[43] The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and did not set an UL.[44]
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percentage of daily value (%DV). For vitamin K labeling purposes the daily value was 80 μg, but as of May 2016 it has been revised upwards to 120 μg. A table of the pre-change adult daily values is provided at reference daily intake. Food and supplement companies have until 28 July 2018 to comply with the change.

Vitamin K1 is found chiefly in leafy green vegetables such as dandelion greens (which contain 778.4 μg per 100 g, or 741% of the recommended daily amount), spinach, swiss chard, lettuce and Brassica vegetables (such as cabbage, kale, cauliflower, broccoli, and brussels sprouts) and often the absorption is greater when accompanied by fats such as butter or oils; some fruits, such as avocados, kiwifruit and grapes, are also high in vitamin K. By way of reference, two tablespoons of parsley contains 153% of the recommended daily amount of vitamin K.[47] Some vegetable oils, notably soybean oil, contain vitamin K, but at levels that would require relatively large calorie consumption to meet the USDA-recommended levels.[48] colonic bacteria synthesize a significant portion of humans' vitamin K needs; newborns often receive a vitamin K shot at birth to tide them over until their colons become colonized at five to seven days of age from the consumption of breast milk.
The tight binding of vitamin K1 to thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts makes it less bioavailable. For example, cooked spinach has a 5% bioavailability of phylloquinone, however, fat added to it increases bioavailability to 13% due to the increased solubility of vitamin K in fat.[49]
Main article: Vitamin K deficiency
Average diets are usually not lacking in vitamin K, and primary deficiency is rare in healthy adults. Newborn infants are at an increased risk of deficiency. Other populations with an increased prevalence of vitamin K deficiency include those who suffer from liver damage or disease (e.g. alcoholics), cystic fibrosis, or inflammatory bowel diseases, or have recently had abdominal surgeries. Secondary vitamin K deficiency can occur in people with bulimia, those on stringent diets, and those taking anticoagulants. Other drugs associated with vitamin K deficiency include salicylates, barbiturates, and cefamandole, although the mechanisms are still unknown. Vitamin K1 deficiency can result in coagulopathy, a bleeding disorder.[50]Symptoms of K1 deficiency include anemia, bruising, nosebleeds and bleeding of the gums in both sexes, and heavy menstrual bleeding in women.
Osteoporosis[51][52] and coronary heart disease[53][54] are strongly associated with lower levels of K2 (menaquinone). Vitamin K2 (as menaquinones MK-4 through MK-10) intake level is inversely related to severe aortic calcification and all-cause mortality.[8]
Function in animals[edit]
Mechanism of action of vitamin K1.
The function of vitamin K2 in the animal cell is to add a carboxylic acid functional group to a glutamate (Glu) amino acid residue in a protein, to form a gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residue. This is a somewhat uncommon posttranslational modification of the protein, which is then known as a ""Gla protein"". The presence of two −COOH (carboxylic acid) groups on the same carbon in the gamma-carboxyglutamate residue allows it to chelate calcium ions. The binding of calcium ions in this way very often triggers the function or binding of Gla-protein enzymes, such as the so-called vitamin K-dependent clotting factors discussed below.
Within the cell, vitamin K undergoes electron reduction to a reduced form called vitamin K hydroquinone, catalyzed by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR).[55] Another enzyme then oxidizes vitamin K hydroquinone to allow carboxylation of Glu to Gla; this enzyme is called gamma-glutamyl carboxylase[56][57] or the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. The carboxylation reaction only proceeds if the carboxylase enzyme is able to oxidize vitamin K hydroquinone to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The carboxylation and epoxidation reactions are said to be coupled. Vitamin K epoxide is then reconverted to vitamin K by VKOR. The reduction and subsequent reoxidation of vitamin K coupled with carboxylation of Glu is called the vitamin K cycle.[58] Humans are rarely deficient in vitamin K1 because, in part, vitamin K1 is continuously recycled in cells.[59]
Warfarin and other 4-hydroxycoumarins block the action of VKOR.[60] This results in decreased concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in tissues, such that the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by the glutamyl carboxylase is inefficient. This results in the production of clotting factors with inadequate Gla. Without Gla on the amino termini of these factors, they no longer bind stably to the blood vessel endothelium and cannot activate clotting to allow formation of a clot during tissue injury. As it is impossible to predict what dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, warfarin treatment must be carefully monitored to avoid overdose.
Gamma-carboxyglutamate proteins[edit]
Main article: Gla domain
The following human Gla-containing proteins (""Gla proteins"") have been characterized to the level of primary structure: blood coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, anticoagulant proteins C and S, and the factor X-targeting protein Z. The bone Gla protein osteocalcin, the calcification-inhibiting matrix Gla protein (MGP), the cell growth regulating growth arrest specific gene 6 protein (Gas6), and the four transmembrane Gla proteins (TMGPs), the function of which is at present unknown. Gas6 can function as a growth factor to activate the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase and stimulate cell proliferation or prevent apoptosis in some cells. In all cases in which their function was known, the presence of the Gla residues in these proteins turned out to be essential for functional activity.
Gla proteins are known to occur in a wide variety of vertebrates: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The venom of a number of Australian snakes acts by activating the human blood-clotting system. In some cases, activation is accomplished by snake Gla-containing enzymes that bind to the endothelium of human blood vessels and catalyze the conversion of procoagulant clotting factors into activated ones, leading to unwanted and potentially deadly clotting.
Another interesting class of invertebrate Gla-containing proteins is synthesized by the fish-hunting snail Conus geographus.[61] These snails produce a venom containing hundreds of neuroactive peptides, or conotoxins, which is sufficiently toxic to kill an adult human. Several of the conotoxins contain two to five Gla residues.[62]
Methods of assessment[edit]
Vitamin K status can be assessed by:
The prothrombin time (PT) test measures the time required for blood to clot. A blood sample is mixed with citric acid and put in a fibrometer; delayed clot formation indicates a deficiency. This test is insensitive to mild deficiency, as the values do not change until the concentration of prothrombin in the blood has declined by at least 50%.[63]
Undercarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II); in a study of 53 newborns, found ""PT (prothrombin time) is a less sensitive marker than PIVKA II"",[64] and as indicated above, PT is unable to detect subclinical deficiencies that can be detected with PIVKA-II testing.
Plasma phylloquinone was found to be positively correlated with phylloquinone intake in elderly British women, but not men,[65] but an article by Schurgers et al. reported no correlation between FFQ[further explanation needed] and plasma phylloquinone.[66]
Urinary γ-carboxyglutamic acid responds to changes in dietary vitamin K intake. Several days are required before any change can be observed. In a study by Booth et al., increases of phylloquinone intakes from 100 μg to between 377 and 417 μg for five days did not induce a significant change. Response may be age-specific.[67]
Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (UcOc) levels have been inversely correlated with stores of vitamin K[68] and bone strength in developing rat tibiae. Another study following 78 post-menopausal Korean women found a supplement regimen of vitamins K and D, and calcium, but not a regimen of vitamin D and calcium, was inversely correlated with reduced UcOc levels.[69]
Function in bacteria[edit]
Many bacteria, such as Escherichia coli found in the large intestine, can synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7 or MK-7, up to MK-11),[70] but not vitamin K1 (phylloquinone). In these bacteria, menaquinone transfers two electrons between two different small molecules, during oxygen-independent metabolic energy production processes (anaerobic respiration).[71] For example, a small molecule with an excess of electrons (also called an electron donor) such as lactate, formate, or NADH, with the help of an enzyme, passes two electrons to menaquinone. The menaquinone, with the help of another enzyme, then transfers these two electrons to a suitable oxidant, such fumarate or nitrate (also called an electron acceptor). Adding two electrons to fumarate or nitrate converts the molecule to succinate or nitrite plus water, respectively.
Some of these reactions generate a cellular energy source, ATP, in a manner similar to eukaryotic cell aerobic respiration, except the final electron acceptor is not molecular oxygen, but fumarate or nitrate. In aerobic respiration, the final oxidant is molecular oxygen (O2), which accepts four electrons from an electron donor such as NADH to be converted to water. E. coli, as facultative anaerobes, can carry out both aerobic respiration and menaquinone-mediated anaerobic respiration.
Injection in newborns[edit]
The blood clotting factors of newborn babies are roughly 30–60% that of adult values; this may be due to the reduced synthesis of precursor proteins and the sterility of their guts. Human milk contains 1–4 μg/L of vitamin K1, while formula-derived milk can contain up to 100 μg/L in supplemented formulas. Vitamin K2 concentrations in human milk appear to be much lower than those of vitamin K1. Occurrence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25–1.7%, with a prevalence of 2–10 cases per 100,000 births.[72] Premature babies have even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency.
Bleeding in infants due to vitamin K deficiency can be severe, leading to hospitalization, blood transfusions, brain damage, and death. Supplementation can prevent most cases of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the newborn. Intramuscular administration is more effective in preventing late vitamin K deficiency bleeding than oral administration.[73][74]
As a result of the occurrences of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended 0.5–1 mg of vitamin K1 be administered to all newborns shortly after birth.[74]
In the UK vitamin K supplementation is recommended for all newborns within the first 24 hours.[75] This is usually given as a single intramuscular injection of 1 mg shortly after birth but as a second-line option can be given by three oral doses over the first month.[76]
Controversy arose in the early 1990s regarding this practice, when two studies suggested a relationship between parenteral administration of vitamin K and childhood cancer,[77] however, poor methods and small sample sizes led to the discrediting of these studies, and a review of the evidence published in 2000 by Ross and Davies found no link between the two.[78] Doctors reported emerging concerns in 2013,[79] after treating children for serious bleeding problems. They cited lack-of newborn vitamin K administration, as the reason that the problems occurred, and recommended that breastfed babies could have an increased risk unless they receive a preventative dose.
In the early 1930s, Danish scientist Henrik Dam investigated the role of cholesterol by feeding chickens a cholesterol-depleted diet.[80] He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC).[81] McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, had used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow. They noticed that chicks fed only fat-depleted chow developed hemorrhages and started bleeding from tag sites.[82] Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that – together with the cholesterol – a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as Koagulationsvitamin. Edward Adelbert Doisy of Saint Louis University did much of the research that led to the discovery of the structure and chemical nature of vitamin K.[83] Dam and Doisy shared the 1943 Nobel Prize for medicine for their work on vitamin K (K1 and K2) published in 1939. Several laboratories synthesized the compound(s) in 1939.[84]
For several decades, the vitamin K-deficient chick model was the only method of quantifying vitamin K in various foods: the chicks were made vitamin K-deficient and subsequently fed with known amounts of vitamin K-containing food. The extent to which blood coagulation was restored by the diet was taken as a measure for its vitamin K content. Three groups of physicians independently found this: Biochemical Institute, University of Copenhagen (Dam and Johannes Glavind), University of Iowa Department of Pathology (Emory Warner, Kenneth Brinkhous, and Harry Pratt Smith), and the Mayo Clinic (Hugh Butt, Albert Snell, and Arnold Osterberg).[85]
The first published report of successful treatment with vitamin K of life-threatening hemorrhage in a jaundiced patient with prothrombin deficiency was made in 1938 by Smith, Warner, and Brinkhous.[86]
The precise function of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when three laboratories (Stenflo et al.,[87] Nelsestuen et al.,[88] and Magnusson et al.[89]) isolated the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor prothrombin (factor II) from cows that received a high dose of a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. It was shown that, while warfarin-treated cows had a form of prothrombin that contained 10 glutamate (Glu) amino acid residues near the amino terminus of this protein, the normal (untreated) cows contained 10 unusual residues that were chemically identified as γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla). The extra carboxyl group in Gla made clear that vitamin K plays a role in a carboxylation reaction during which Glu is converted into Gla.
The biochemistry of how vitamin K is used to convert Glu to Gla has been elucidated over the past thirty years in academic laboratories throughout the world.

Unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed. For vitamin K1 the form usually used as a supplement, see Phytomenadione. MK-4 and MK-7 are both subtypes of K2. Vitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2, which can only be produced by bacteria. The natural K1 and all K2 homologues and synthetic K4 and K5 have proven nontoxic, but the synthetic form K3 (menadione) has shown toxicity. A review of 2014 concluded that there is positive evidence that monotherapy using one of the forms of Vitamin K2 reduces fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis. In contrast, an earlier review article of 2013 concluded there is no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation helps prevent fractures in post menopausal women. No good evidence that vitamin K supplementation is of any benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), is demonstrably toxic at high levels. Vitamin K is part of the suggested treatment regime for poisoning by rodenticide (coumarin poisoning).[10] No known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (Vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of Vitamin K. The U.S. FDA has banned this form from over-the-counter sale in the United States because large doses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells. Sometimes small amounts of vitaminK are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable. The proper anticoagulant action is a function of vitamink intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient. The action of warfar in and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect. Neither warfarins or vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given. Vitamin K1 is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants. It is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach) It occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.) Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. Vitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins. 17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered, and they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes: blood coagulation, bone metabolism and vascular biology. Diets low in vitamin K also decrease the body's vitamin K concentration. Those with chronic kidney disease are at risk for vitamin K deficiency, as well as vitamin D deficiency, and particularly those with the apoE4 genotype. The National Academy of Medicine updated an estimate of what constitutes an adequate intake of vitamin K in 2001. Vitamin K1 is found chiefly in leafy green vegetables such as dandelion greens, spinach, swiss chard, lettuce and Brassica vegetables. Vitamin K1 deficiency can result in coagulopathy, a bleeding disorder. Secondary vitamin K deficiency can occur in people with bulimia, those on stringent diets, and those taking anticoagulants. Osteoporosis[51] and coronary heart disease are strongly associated with lower levels of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) Vitamin K2 intake level is inversely related to severe aortic calcification and all-cause mortality.[8]Function in animals is to add a carboxylic acid functional group to a glutamate (Glu) amino acid residue in a animal cell. This is a somewhat uncommon modification of the protein, which is then known as a post-translational modification. The presence of two protein groups on the same carb is known as the ""COOH"" (carboxyl acid) effect. For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percentage of daily value (%DV) For vitamin K labeling purposes the daily value was 80 μg, but as of May 2016 it has been revised upwards to 120 μg. Gla proteins are known to occur in a wide variety of vertebrates: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The venom of a number of Australian snakes acts by activating the human blood-clotting system. In some cases, activation is accomplished by snake Gla-containing enzymes that bind to the endothelium of human blood vessels and catalyze the conversion of procoagulant clotting factors into activated ones. Warfarin and other 4-hydroxycoumarins block the action of VKOR. This results in decreased concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in tissues. It is impossible to predict what dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, so it must be carefully monitored to avoid overdose. The prothrombin time (PT) test measures the time required for blood to clot. A blood sample is mixed with citric acid and put in a fibrometer. This test is insensitive to mild deficiency, as the values do not change until the blood has declined at least 50%.[63] In a study of 53 newborns, 53% found ""prothrom bin time"" to be less than 53 seconds. Plasma phylloquinone was found to be positively correlated with vitamin K intake in elderly British women, but not men. Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (UcOc) levels have been inversely correlated with stores of vitamin K and bone strength in developing rat tibiae. The blood clotting factors of newborn babies are roughly 30–60% that of adult values. Vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25–1.7%, with a prevalence of 2–10 cases per 100,000 births. Premature babies have even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency. Supplementation is recommended for all newborns within the first 24 hours of birth. Intramuscular administration is more effective in preventing late vitamin K deficiency bleed than oral administration. The Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended 0.5–1 mg of vitamins K1 be administered to all newbornS shortly after birth. This single intramususus is usually given as a second-line injection of 1 mg over the first month of life. In the early 1930s, Danish scientist Henrik Dam investigated the role of cholesterol by feeding chickens a cholesterol-depleted diet. Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that – together with the cholesterol – a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. Several laboratories synthesized the compound(s) in 1939. The precise function of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when three laboratories (Stenflo et al.,[87] Nelsestuen et al. and Magnusson et al.) isolated the vitamin K-dependent coagulating factor prothrombin (factor II) from cows that received a high dose of a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. The extra carboxyl group in Gla made clear that vitamin K plays a role in a carboxyglutamate reaction during which Glu is converted into Gla. The biochemistry of how vitamin K is used to convert Glu to Gla has been elucidated over the past thirty years in academic laboratories throughout the world. Vitamin K has been linked to a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. Vitamin K administration to elderly patients with osteoporosis induces no hemostatic activation, even in those with suspected vitamin K deficiency.

What is the security parameter for the AES-256 block cipher?,"\section{Introduction\label{sct::intro}}
Symmetric, public-key (asymmetric) and hash-based cryptography constitute a fundamental pillar of modern cryptography. 
Symmetric cryptography includes symmetric-key encryption, where a shared secret key is used for both encryption and decryption. Cryptographic hash functions map arbitrarily long strings to strings of a fixed finite length. Currently deployed public-key schemes are
used to establish a common secret key between two remote parties. They are based on factoring large numbers or solving the discrete logarithm problem over a finite group. For more details about modern cryptography the interested reader can consult one of the many excellent references on the topic, e.g.~\cite{Katz:2007:IMC:1206501}.

In contrast to asymmetric schemes based on factoring or solving the discrete logarithm problem and which are completely broken by a quantum adversary via Shor's algorithm~\cite{SJC.26.1484}, symmetric schemes and hash functions are less vulnerable to quantum attacks. The best known quantum attacks against them are based on Grover's quantum search algorithm~\cite{PhysRevLett.79.325}, which offers a quadratic speedup compared to classical brute force searching. Given a search space of size $N$, Grover's algorithm finds, with high probability, an element $x$ for which a certain property such as $f(x)=1$ holds, for some function $f$ we know how to evaluate (assuming such a solution exists). The algorithm evaluates $f$ a total of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ times. It applies a simple operation in between the evaluations of $f$, so the $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ evaluations of $f$ account for most of the complexity. In contrast, any classical algorithm that evaluates $f$ in a similar ``black-box'' way requires on the order of $N$ evaluations of $f$ to find such an element.

Any quantum algorithm can be mapped to a quantum circuit, which can be implemented on a quantum computer. The quantum circuit represents what we call the ``logical layer"". Such a circuit can always be decomposed in a sequence of ``elementary 
gates"", such as Clifford gates (CNOT, Hadamard etc.~\cite{NC00}) augmented by a non-Clifford gate such as the T gate.

Running a logical circuit on a full fault-tolerant quantum computer is highly non-trivial. The sequence of logical gates have to be mapped to 
sequences of surface code measurement cycles (see e.g.~\cite{PhysRevA.86.032324} for extensive details). By far, the most resource-consuming (in 
terms of number of qubits required and time) is the T gate\footnote{Clifford gates are ``cheap"", i.e. they require relatively small overhead for implementation in the surface code, but are not universals, hence a non-Clifford gate is required. One such gate is the T gate. There are other possible choices, however all of the non-Clifford gates require special techniques such as magic state distillation~\cite{1367-2630-14-12-123011,PhysRevA.86.052329} and significant overhead (order of magnitudes higher than Clifford gates) to be implemented in the surface code. In fact, to a first order approximation, for the purpose of resource estimation, one can simply ignore the overhead introduced by the Clifford gates and simply focus only on the T gates.}. 
In comparison with surface code defects and braiding techniques~\cite{PhysRevA.86.032324}, novel lattice surgery 
techniques~\cite{2018arXiv180806709F,1808.02892,1367-2630-14-12-123011} reduce the spatial overhead required for implementing T gates via magic state distillation by approximately a factor of 5, while also modestly improving the running time. 

In this paper we first analyze the security of symmetric schemes and hash functions against large-scale fault-tolerant quantum adversaries, using surface code defects and braiding techniques. We take into account the time-space trade-offs with parallelizing quantum search, down to the fault-tolerant layer. Naively, one might hope that $K$ quantum computers (or quantum ``processors'', as we will call them later in the paper) running in parallel reduce the number the circuit depth down to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})/K$ steps, similar to the classical case of distributing a search space across $K$ classical processors. However quantum searching does not parallelize so well, and the required number of steps
for parallel quantum searching is of the order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N/K})$~\cite{quantph.9711070}. This is a factor of $\sqrt{K}$ larger than $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})/K$ . As shown in~\cite{quantph.9711070}, the optimal way of doing parallel quantum search is to partition the search space into $N/K$ parts, and to perform independent quantum searches on each part.

Secondly, we investigate the security of public-key cryptographic schemes such as RSA and ECC against 
quantum attacks, using the latest developments in theory of fault-tolerant quantum error correction, i.e. novel lattice surgery 
techniques~\cite{2018arXiv180806709F,1808.02892,1367-2630-14-12-123011}.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec.~\ref{sct::method}, we provide an overview of the methodology used in our analysis. In Sec.~\ref{sct::ciphers} we investigate the security of the AES family of modern symmetric ciphers. In Sec.~\ref{sct::hash} we analyze the security of the SHA family of hash functions. In Sec.~\ref{sct::bitcoin} we investigate the security of Bitcoin's~\cite{satoshi:bitcoin} proof-of-work consensus mechanism. We conclude our investigation of symmetric and hash-based cryptographic schemes in Sec.~\ref{sct::intrinsic_parallel_grover}, where we evaluate the intrinsic cost of running the Grover algorithm with a trivial oracle (i.e., an oracle with a unit cost of 1 for each invocation).

In the subsequent sections  we analyze public-key cryptographic schemes. In Sec.~\ref{sct::rsa} and Sec.~\ref{sct::ecc} we examine the most common public-key establishment schemes, such as RSA and ECC, respectively. In the subsequent sections  we analyze public-key cryptographic schemes. In Sec.~\ref{sct::rsa} and Sec.~\ref{sct::ecc} we examine the most common public-key establishment schemes, such as RSA and ECC, respectively. Finally we summarize our findings and conclude in Sec.~\ref{sct::conclusion}.
\section{Methodology\label{sct::method}}

\subsection{Symmetric cryptography and hash functions\label{sct::symmetric}}
The methodology, sketched in Fig.~\ref{fgr:flowchart_lite} and Fig.~\ref{fgr:full_algorithm}, follows the same lines as the one described in great detail in our earlier paper~\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-69453-5_18}, which we refer the interested reader to for more details.

Our resource estimation methodology takes into account several of the layers between the high level description of an algorithm and the physical hardware required for its execution. Our approach is modular should assumptions about any of these layers change, and hence it allows one to calculate the impact of improvements in any particular layer.}

$G$, the \emph{Grover iteration}, or, if parallelized on $K$ processors, $\lfloor \frac{\pi}{4} 2^{N/(2K)}\rfloor$ calls to $G$. The Grover iteration has two
subroutines. The first, $U_g$, implements the predicate $g : \{0,1\}^k
\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ that maps $x$ to $1$ if and only if $f(x) = y$. Each call to $U_g$ involves two calls to a reversible implementation of $f$ and one call to a comparison circuit that checks whether $f(x) = y$.}
          \label{fgr:full_algorithm}
\end{figure}

We assume a surface-code based fault-tolerant architecture~\cite{PhysRevA.86.032324}, using Reed-Muller distillation schemes~\cite{Fowler:2013aa}. For each scheme we vary the possible physical error rates per gate from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-7}$. We believe that this range of physical error rates is wide enough to cover both first generation quantum computers as well as more advanced future machines.
In comparison to surface code defects and braiding methods~\cite{PhysRevA.86.032324}, lattice surgery 
techniques~\cite{2018arXiv180806709F,1808.02892,1367-2630-14-12-123011} mostly impact the physical footprint of the fault-tolerant layer required to run a specific quantum algorithm, reducing the distillation overhead by approximately a factor of 5. The temporal overhead (i.e. the number of surface code cycles) is reduced less drastically. For this reason, lattice surgery has less significant effects in estimating the security of symmetric schemes or hash functions, reducing the security parameter\footnote{The security parameter is defined as the logarithm base two of the number of fundamental operations (in our case surface code cycles) required to break the scheme.} by at most 1 and decreasing the spatial overhead by at most a factor of 5. Therefore when estimating the security of symmetric and hash-based cryptographic schemes we use surface code defects and braiding techniques.

For each cryptographic primitive, we display four plots, in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We plot the total number of surface code cycles per CPU (where a CPU is a quantum computer capable of executing a single instance of Grover's quantum search algorithm) as a function of the number of CPUs. We directly tie the quantum security parameter to the total number of surface code cycles (see~\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-69453-5_18} for more details). We also add to the plot the theoretical lower bound achievable by quantum search in the cases of: a) considering the oracle a black box of unit cost (lower line), and b) considering the oracle as composed of ideal quantum gates, each of unit cost (upper line). Note that the difference between b) and a) represents the intrinsic cost of logical overhead (i.e. the overhead introduced by treating the oracle as a logical circuit and not a blackbox), whereas the difference between the upper lines and b) represents the intrinsic cost introduced by the fault-tolerant layer.

\item We plot the total wall-time per CPU (i.e. how long will the whole computation take on a parallel quantum architecture) as a function of the number of CPUs. The horizontal dashed line represents the one-year time line, i.e. the $x$ coordinate of the intersection point between the ``Total time per CPU'' line and the one-year time line provides the number of processors required to break the system within one year (in $\log_2$ units).

\item We plot the total physical footprint (number of qubits) per CPU, as a function of the number of CPUs.
\item Finally we plot the total physical footprint (number of qubits) of all quantum search machines (CPUs) running in parallel.
\end{enumerate}

In the following sections we proceed to analyze symmetric ciphers (AES, Sec.~\ref{sct::ciphers}), hash functions (SHA-256, SHA3-256, Sec.~\ref{sct::hash}, Bitcoin's hash function, Sec.~\ref{sct::bitcoin}), and finally the minimal resources required for running Grover's algorithm with a trivial oracle~\ref{sct::intrinsic_parallel_grover} (e.g. the identity gate) on search spaces of various sizes.

Note that in some ranges of the plots from sections~\ref{sct::ciphers},~\ref{sct::hash},~\ref{sct::intrinsic_parallel_grover} and~\ref{sct::bitcoin} the total physical footprint increases slightly with the number of processors, which may seem counter-intuitive. This happens due to the fact that with more processors the required code distances decrease, and in some instances one can pipeline more magic states factories in parallel into the surface code, which in effect causes an increase in the overall physical footprint. Note that the total time per CPU is monotonically decreasing, as parallelizing distilleries does not increase the wall time. For more details see~\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-69453-5_18}. 

\subsection{Public-key cryptography\label{sct::pk}}

Most of the recent progress in quantum cryptanalysis is related to the fault-tolerant layer in Fig.~\ref{fgr:flowchart_lite}. New methods and techniques
based on surface code lattice surgery~\cite{2018arXiv180806709F,1808.02892,1367-2630-14-12-123011} allow a significant decrease of the overall 
footprint (number of qubits, or space) taken by the quantum computation, and also a relatively modest decrease in time, in comparison with  methods based on surface code defects and braiding~\cite{PhysRevA.86.032324,Fowler:2013aa}.

We consider the best up-to-date optimized logical quantum circuits for attacking RSA and ECC public-key 
schemes~\cite{1706.06752,PhysRevA.52.3457,cuccaro04,Beauregard:2003:CSA:2011517.2011525} then perform a physical footprint resource estimation
analysis using lattice surgery techniques. We remark that the overall time required to run the algorithm depends on the level of parallelization 
for the magic state factories\footnote{Every T gate in the circuit must be implemented by a specialized magic state factory, each of which occupies a 
significant physical footprint. One can implement more magic states in parallel if one is willing to increase the physical footprint of the computation.}. 

For each public-key cryptogrpric scheme, we analyze the space/time tradeoffs and plot the results on a double logarithmic scale. We fit the data using a third degree 
polynomial\footnote{A third degree polynomial fits the data very precisely, providing a coefficient of determination $R^2$ greater than 0.997.} and obtain an analytical closed-form formula for the relation between the time and the number of qubits required to attack the scheme, in 
the form

\begin{equation}\label{eqn1}
y(x) = \alpha x^3 + \beta x^2 + \gamma x + \delta,
\end{equation}
where $y$ represents logarithm base 2 of the number of qubits and $x$ represents the logarithm base 2 of the time (in seconds). For example,
the quantity 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn2}
y\left(\log_2(24\times 3600)\right) \approx y(16.3987)
\end{equation}
represents how many qubits are required to break the scheme in one day (24 hours) for a fixed physical error rate per gate $p_g$, assuming a 
surface code cycle time of 200ns. Note that the computation time scales linearly with the surface code cycle time, e.g. a 1000ns surface code cycle 
time will result in a computation that is 5 times longer than a $200ns$ surface code cycle time. Therefore, for a specific cryptographic scheme for 
which we plotted the space/time tradeoffs using a surface code cycle time of $200ns$ and a fixed physical error rate per gate $p_g$, the number of 
qubits required to break a specific scheme in a time $t$ using an alternative surface code cycle time $t_c$ is given by

\begin{equation}\label{eqn3}
y\left(\log_2\left(\frac{200ns}{t_c}t\right)\right),
\end{equation}
where $t$ is expressed in seconds and $t_c$ is expressed in nanoseconds.

We assume a surface code cycle time of 200ns, in conformance with~\cite{PhysRevA.86.032324}. For each scheme we analyze, we compare its security using the more conservative (and realistic in the short term) $p_g=10^{-3}$ and also the more optimistic  $p_g=10^{-5}$. Note that assuming the more optimistic assumption from a quantum computing perspective is the more conservative assumption from a cybersecurity perspective.

Furthermore, in this analysis, we are reporting the full physical footprint, including the memory required for magic state distillation.
Using present-day techniques, the memory required for generating these generic input states accounts for a substantial fraction of the total memory cost and thus we are including these in the total cost estimate and will track the impact of improved methods.

\section{Symmetric ciphers\label{sct::ciphers}}
Below we analyze the security of AES family of symmetric ciphers against large-scale fault-tolerant quantum adversaries. We used the highly optimized logical circuits produced in
\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-29360-8_3}. 

\subsection{AES-128}

        \includegraphics[width=0.429\textwidth]{figures/AES-128_cycles.pdf}
      	\captionof{figure}{AES-128 block cipher. Required surface clock cycles per processor, as a function of the  number of processors ($\log_2$ scale). The bottom brown line (theoretical lower bound, black box) represents the minimal number of queries required
	by Grover's algorithm, the cost function being the total number of queries to a black-box oracle, each query assumed to have unit cost, and a completely error-free circuit. The purple line (ideal grover, non-black-box) takes into consideration the structure of the oracle, the cost function being the total number of gates in the circuit, each gate having unit cost; the quantum circuit is assumed error-free as well. Both brown and magenta lines are displayed only for comparisons; for both of them, the $y$ axis should be interpreted as number of logical queries (operations, respectively).	
The curves above the purple line show the overhead introduced by fault tolerance (in terms of required surface code cycles, each surface code cycle assumed to have unit cost). More optimization at the logical layer will shift the purple line down, whereas more optimization at the fault-tolerant layer will move the upper curves closer to the purple line. Similar remarks to the above hold for the remaining plots in this manuscript.}
      	\label{fgr:aes_128_cycles}
	
	For example, the plots in Fig.~\ref{fgr:aes_128_cycles} tells us that if we have $2^{50}$ quantum computers running Grover's algorithm in parallel, with no physical errors, then it would take about $2^{63}$ gate calls (where the purple line intersects the vertical line at $50$), where we assume each gate to have unit cost. Still with no errors, a trivial cost for implementing the cryptographic function (oracle) would bring the cost down to about $2^{38}$ oracle calls per quantum computer. Keeping the actual function implementation, but adding the fault-tolerant layer with a physical error rate of $10^{-7}$ (with appropriate assumptions and using state-of-the-art quantum error correction) pushes the cost up to around $2^{76}$ surface code cycles per quantum computer (where now each code cycle is assumed to have unit cost). Similar remarks hold for the remaining plots in this manuscript.

      	\captionof{figure}{AES-128 block cipher. Required time per processor, as a function of the  number of processors ($\log_2$ scale). The horizontal dotted line indicates one year. The $x$-axis is deliberately extended to show the necessary number of CPUs for a total time of one year. Thus the figure shows that it would take, with the stated assumptions, over $2^{80}$ parallel quantum searches to break AES-128 in a year. Similar remarks to the above hold for the remaining plots in this manuscript.}

\section{Hash functions\label{sct::hash}}
In this section we study the effect of parallelized Grover attacks on the SHA-256~\cite{SHA2} snd SHA3-256~\cite{SHA3} family of hash functions. We used the highly optimized logical circuits produced in~\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-69453-5_18}.

\section{Bitcoin~\label{sct::bitcoin}}
In this section we analyze the security of Bitcoin's~\cite{satoshi:bitcoin} proof-of-work protocol, which is based on finding a hash\footnote{The hash function being used by the protocol is H($x$) := SHA-256(SHA-256($x$).} pre-image which that starts
with a certain number of zeros. The latter is dynamically adjusted by the protocol so that the problem is on average solved by
the whole network in 10 minutes. Currently, it takes around $2^{75}$ classical hashing operations~\cite{btc_difficulty} for finding a desired hash pre-image successfully via brute-force search with specialized hardware.

\section{Intrinsic cost of parallelized Grover's algorithm\label{sct::intrinsic_parallel_grover}}

More efficient quantum implementations of AES and SHA imply more efficient cryptanalysis. In this section, we aim to bound how much further optimized implementations of these cryptographic functions could help. We do so by assuming a trivial cost of $1$ for each function evaluation.

namely RSA-1024, RSA-2048, RSA-3072, RSA-4096, RSA-7680 and RSA-15360.

problem in finite groups generated over elliptic curves, namely NIST P-160, NIST P-192, NIST P-224, NIST P-256, NIST P-384 and NIST P-521. For 
each scheme, we plot the space/time tradeoff points then fit it with a third degree polynomial, for $p_g=10^{-3}$ and $p_g=10^{-5}$, respectively. We

\section{Summary and conclusions}\label{sct::conclusion}
We analyzed the security of several widely used symmetric ciphers and hash functions against parallelized quantum adversaries. We computed the security parameter, wall-time and physical footprint for each cryptographic primitive. Our attack model was based on a brute force searching via a parallelized version of Grover's algorithm, assuming a surface-code fault-tolerant architecture based on defects and braiding techniques.

It is worth noting that throughout we are assuming that brute-force search where we treat the cryptographic function as a black-box is essentially the optimal attack against SHA and AES, which is currently believed to be the case.

Some symmetric key algorithms are susceptible in a model that permits ``superposition attacks''~\cite{quantph.1602.05973}. In most realistic instances, these attacks are not practical, however they do shed light on the limitations of certain security proof methods in a quantum context, and remind us that we shouldn't take for granted that non-trivial attacks on symmetric key cryptography may be possible.
For example, very recently, there have been several cryptanalysis results~\cite{1712.06239} and~\cite{1802.03856} that attempt to reduce breaking some symmetric algorithms to solving a system of non-linear equations.  Solving these non-linear equations is then attacked using a modified version of the quantum linear equation solver algorithm~\cite{PhysRevLett.103.150502}. The results are heavily dependent on the condition number of the non-linear system, which turns to be hard to compute (it is not known for most ciphers and hash functions such as AES or SHA). Provided the condition number is relatively small, then one may get an  advantage compared to brute-force Grover search. However at this time it is not clear whether this is indeed the case, and we do not have large-scale quantum computers to experiment with.

The quantum security parameter (based on our assumptions of using state-of-the-art algorithms and fault-tolerance methods) for symmetric and hash-based cryptographic schemes is summarized in Table~\ref{tbl1}. For more details about space/time tradeoffs achievable via parallelization of Grover's algorithm please see the corresponding Sec.~\ref{sct::ciphers}, Sec.~\ref{sct::hash} and Sec.~\ref{sct::bitcoin}, respectively.

We also analyzed the security of asymmetric (public-key) cryptography, in particular RSA and ECC, in the light of new improvements in fault-tolerant 
quantum error correction based on surface code lattice surgery techniques. We computed the space/time tradeoff required to attack 
every scheme, using physical error rates of $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-5}$, respectively. We fitted the data with a third degree polynomial, which resulted in an analytical formula of the number of qubits required to break the 
scheme as a function of time.

The total number of physical qubits required to break the RSA schemes in 24 hours, together with the required number of $T$ gates, corresponding number of surface code cycles and corresponding classical security parameter is summarized in Table~\ref{tbl2}.

Recent developments in the theory of fault-tolerant quantum error correction have great impact on evaluating the effective strength of cryptographic
schemes against quantum attacks, as the fault-tolerant layer of a quantum computation is the most resource-intensive part of running a quantum  
algorithm. Therefore, monitoring the advances in the theory of quantum error correction is of crucial importance when estimating the strength (or 
weakness) of a cryptographic scheme against a quantum adversary. This work serves as a benchmark against which the impact of future advances can be compared.

The best known quantum attacks against them are based on Grover's quantum search algorithm, which offers a quadratic speedup compared to classical brute force searching. Any quantum algorithm can be mapped to a quantum circuit, which can be implemented on a quantum computer. We hope that one might hope, down to the fault-tolerant layer, that quantum computers (or quantumprocessors') could be used to improve the security of symmetric schemes and hash functions against large-scale quantum adversaries. We take into account the time-space trade-offs with quantum search, as well as trade-off techniques such as magic state distillation to reduce the running time of quantum computers. We conclude with a proposal for a new type of quantum computer, the K-processor, which would be able to solve the problem of quantum encryption without the need for a large number of qubits. We also propose a new kind of quantum algorithm, the Q-processer, which could be applied to quantum computers to solve problems such as quantum encryption and encryption. We end the paper with a suggestion for a quantum algorithm that would allow us to use quantum computers in the future. In the first section we investigate the security of public-key cryptographic schemes such as RSA and ECC against quantum attacks. In the second section we evaluate the intrinsic cost of running the Grover algorithm with a trivial oracle (i.e., an oracle with a unit cost of 1 for each invocation) We conclude our investigation of symmetric and hash-based cryptographic schemes in the third section. The methodology follows the same lines as the one described in great detail in our earlier paper, which we refer the interested reader to for more details. Our resource estimation methodology takes into account several of the layers between the high level description of an algorithm and the physical hardware required for its execution. Our approach is modular should assumptions about any of these layers change, and allows one to calculate the impact of improvements in any particular layer. We conclude in Sec.~\ref{sct::conclusion}. We provide an overview of the methodology used in our analysis. The algorithm makes the calls to Grover to the oracle, oracle to the floor, orfloor to thefloor, or floor to floor. We call these calls the ‘Groververtical’ oracle calls, or ‘grover-based’ calls, and we refer to them as ‘the Grover oracle’. In the following sections we analyze symmetric ciphers (AES, Sec.~\ref{sct::ciphers}), hash functions (SHA-256, SHA3-256), Bitcoin's hash function, and finally the minimal resources required for running Grover's algorithm with a trivial oracle. We plot the total wall-time per CPU (i.e. how long will the whole computation take on a parallel quantum architecture) as a function of the number of CPUs. We also add to the plot the theoretical lower bound achievable by quantum search in the cases of: a) considering the oracle a black box of unit cost (lower line) and b) considering it as composed of ideal quantum gates, each of unit costs (upper line) The horizontal dashed line represents the one-year time line, i.e the $x$ coordinate of the intersection point between the ``Total time per CPU'' line and the one year time line. We show the total physical footprint (number of qubits) per CPU, as a result of the different types of processors used in the study. We conclude by looking at the impact of the various search spaces of various cryptographic primitive. uses an increase in the overall physical footprint. Note that the total time per CPU is monotonically decreasing, as parallelizing distilleries does not increase the wall time. For each public-key cryptogrpric scheme, we analyze the space/time tradeoffs and plot the results on a double logarithmic scale. We consider the best up-to-date optimized logical quantum circuits for attacking RSA and ECC public-keys. We assume a surface code cycle time of 200ns and a fixed physical error rate per gate $p_g$, in conformance with the security of each scheme. We are reporting the full physical footprint, including the memory required for magic state distillation, for the present analysis, including memory for the full quantum footprint, and for the future analysis of quantum computing in the future. For more details see~\cite 10.1007/978-3-319-69453-5_18 and http://www.physRevA.com/news/article.php?storylink=cpy,%20title%20of%20the%20full%20physical%20footprint%20for%20quantum%20computing in the future, including%20memory%20and%20others%. We analyze the security of AES family of symmetric ciphers against large-scale fault-tolerant quantum adversaries. We used the highly optimized logical circuits produced in 10.1007/978-3-319-29360-8_3. The bottom brown line (theoretical lower bound, black box) represents the minimal number of queries required by Grover's algorithm. The purple line (ideal grover, non-black-box) takes into consideration the structure of the oracle, the cost function being the total number of gates in the circuit, each gate having unit cost; the quantum circuit is assumed error-free as well. The curves above the purple line show the overhead introduced by fault tolerance (in terms of required surface code cycles, each surface code cycle assumed to have unit cost) The horizontal dotted line indicates one year. The $x$-axis is deliberately extended to show the necessary number of CPUs for a total time of one year, with the stated assumptions that it would take over $2^{80$ parallel quantum searches to break AES-128 in a year. Similar remarks to the above hold for the remaining plots in this manuscript. For example, the plots in Fig.~\ref{fgr:aes_128_cycles} tell us that if we have $2.50$ quantum computers running Grover’s algorithm in parallel, with no physical errors, then it will take about $2 63$ gate calls. per processor, as a function of the  number of processors ($\log_2$ scale). We used the highly optimized logical circuits produced by the in~10-3-319-cite family of hash functions. In this section we study the effect of parallelized Grover attacks on the SHA-256 and SHA3-256~cite{SHA2} snd hash functions of the SHA3 family. We use the in-house SHA-2 and SHA-3 family of cryptographic hash functions for our analysis. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for the current state of the art in cryptanalysis. We also discuss the implications for the future development of cryptosystems and the development of new cryptographic algorithms. We end with a look at the results of our analysis of the hash functions used in the SHA2 andSHA3 family for the SHA4 and SHA5 crypto-components. We will conclude by looking at the effects of the Grover attack on the hash function in the next section of the paper. We hope that this will help us understand how to improve the security of our cryptographic algorithms in the future. The next section will focus on the impact of Grover Attacks on the cryptographic hash function, and how they can be used in a variety of new ways to attack SHA2. In this section we analyze the security of Bitcoin's proof-of-work protocol. The protocol is based on finding a hash pre-image which starts with a certain number of zeros. The latter is dynamically adjusted by the protocol so that the problem is on average solved by the whole network in 10 minutes. In this section, we aim to bound how much more efficient quantum implementations of SHA and AES imply more efficient cryptanalysis. We do so by assuming a trivial cost of $1$ for each evaluation of each function. We also assume a trivial size of $2,000 for each function, so that each function could be evaluated for $1,000 times the cost of each evaluation. We conclude by looking at how much better our analysis could have been if we had used a more efficient hash function, such as SHA-1 or SHA-2, instead of the more expensive SHA-3, and how much faster it would have been to evaluate each function for the same amount of space. We then look at the total number of qubits per processor, as a function of the number of processors ($\log_2$ scale) and how long it takes to solve the problem. We end with the results of our analysis of the hash function and the total footprint of the Bitcoin network. g Grover's algorithm with a trivial oracle, for a searching space of size $2^{56}$. Physical footprint (physical qubits) per processor, as a function of the number of processors ($\log_2$ scale). Note that the qubits are not correlated across processors. Required surface clock cycles per processor. Required time per processor as a result of the  number of  processors. Total physical footprint ( physical qubits), as afunction of the  number of processor ($log_1$ scale) and the size of the searching space. The number of qubits per processor is proportional to the number of  processors in the algorithm. The total physical footprint (physical qubits) of a processor is the same for all algorithms with and without an oracle. The total physical footprint per processor is the same as that of a single oracle with an oracle with an algorithm with no oracle on it. The qubits of each processor are the same, but the size of the searching space and time per processor is different for different alaxies on the same algorithm. For example, for the Grover64 algorithm, the total physical footprint per  processor is the same as the total footprint of the algorithm with no oracles. In the following section we compute the space/time tradeoffs for attacking public-key cryptographic schemes based on factoring large numbers. The schemes are RSA-1024, RSA-2048,. RSA-3072, RSA -4096, RSA -7680 and RSA-15360. For each scheme, we plot the space and time tradeoff points then fit it with a third degree polynomial. The scale is logarithmic (base 2). Approximately $y(16.3987) \approx 3.01\times 10^7$ physical qubits are required to break the scheme in one day (24 hours). The number of T gates in the circuit is $3.01 \times 10^{11}$, the corresponding number of logical qubits is 2050. The quantity $R^2$ represents the coefficient of determination (closer to 1, better the fitting). The classical security parameter is approximately 80 bits. The scheme tradeoffs with physical error rate per gate $p_g=10^{-5}$. The scheme space/ time tradeoffs are $10minus3/RSA1024.png, $10 minus 5/R SA-20 48.png and $10 plus 5/SA-15 360. assical security parameter is approximately 112 bits. The number of T gates in the circuit is $8.12\times 10^{12}$, the corresponding number of logical qubits is 6146, and the total number of surface code cycles is $1.58\times10^{15}$. The classical security parameter in this circuit is approximately 128 bits. Approximately $y(16.3987) is required to break the scheme in one day (24 hours) and $6.41 is needed to break it in 24 hours. The circuit has 15362 T gates and a surface code cycle of $3.75. It is estimated that the circuit can be solved in one hour and a half using a single-qubit algorithm. It can also be solved using multiple-qubits and a multiple-digit algorithm using multiple gates. It has an error rate of $10^{-3} and a space/time tradeoffs with physical error rate per gate of $p_g=10^-5$. The circuit can easily be solved with multiple-bit algorithms using a number of different algorithms. It could also be used to solve complex problems with multiple gates in a single operation. It would be possible to solve a complex problem with a multiple of gates in one operation. In the following section we compute the space/time tradeoffs for attacking public-key cryptographic schemes based on solving the discrete logarithm  problem. The schemes are generated over elliptic curves, namely NIST P-160, NIST. P-192, Nist P-224, NISM P-256, NISH P-384 and NISTP-521. For each scheme, we plot the space/.time tradeoff points then fit it with a third degree polynomial, for $p_g=10^{-3}$ and $p-g= 10^{-5}$, respectively. We  use the logical circuits from~\cite{1706.06752}. The number of T gates in the circuit is $2.08. The corresponding number of logical qubits is 1466, and the total number of surface code cycles is $4.05. The classical security parameter is 80 bits. We use the following schemes: NIST P.160, P.192, P- 224, and P.521, which are all based on the elliptic curve schemes. We also use a different scheme based on a different type of algorithm. We call this scheme the NIST-P-160 scheme. 4 elliptic curve space/time tradeoffs with physical error rate per gate $p_g=10^{-3}$. The scale is logarithmic (base 2). Approximately $y(16.3987) \approx 4.91\times 10^7$ physical qubits are required to break the scheme in one day (24 hours) The number of T gates in the circuit is $5.90\times. 10^{11}$, the corresponding number of logical qubits is 2042, and the total number of surface code cycles is $1.15\times10^{14]$. The classical security parameter is 112 bits. 4. The total number. of surfaces code cycles in the scheme is $6.6484, the total. number of. surface code. cycles is 10484 and the classical security. parameter is 192 bits. 5. The maximum number of qubits that can be used to break a scheme is 192, the maximum number that can't be used is 192. 6. The most common way to solve the problem is to use a computer program that has a large number of Turing-style gates. 7. The largest possible number of surfaces to use is 10, the most common number is 10. We analyzed the security of several widely used symmetric ciphers and hash functions against parallelized quantum adversaries. We computed the security parameter, wall-time and physical footprint for each cryptographic primitive. Our attack model was based on a brute force searching via a parallelized version of Grover's algorithm, assuming a surface-code fault-tolerant architecture based on defects and braiding techniques. The results are heavily dependent on the condition number of the non-linear system, which turns to be hard to compute (it is not known for most Ciphers or Hash functions). We also analyzed the. security of asymmetric (public-key) cryptography, in particular RSA and ECC, in the light of new fault- tolerant improvements in. new code-quantum error correction techniques. We fitted the data with a third degree polynomial, which computed the space/time tradeoff required to attack every scheme, using physical error rates of $10-3-5 and $ 10-5-5. We concluded that the classical security parameter is 256 bits, which is the same as the quantum security parameter. We are assuming that brute-force search where we treat the cryptographic function as a black-box is essentially the optimal attack against SHA and AES, which it is currently believed to be the case. a function of time. The total number of physical qubits required to break the RSA schemes in 24 hours, together with the required number of $T$ gates, corresponding number of surface code cycles and corresponding classical security parameter is summarized in Table~\ref{tbl2}. For more details about possible space/time tradeoffs please see the corresponding Section~’ref{sct::rsa’ of the manuscript. We assume a very conservative physical error rate per gate $p_g=10^{-3}$, more likely to be achievable by the first generations of fault-tolerant quantum computers. As observed before, breaking RSA schemes demands more quantum resources in comparison with elliptic curve-based schemes, for the same level of classical security. We also assume that the cost of breaking the ECC schemes is less than $1.5 billion dollars per qubit. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our results for the design of quantum computers and the development of quantum computing. We hope that this will be of interest to those who are interested in quantum computing and the security implications of the schemes we are proposing. We are happy to answer any questions you may have about the proposed schemes or our results. We will be happy to provide any further information about our results in the future.

What is the definition of mobile device management (MDM)?,"Hospitals as critical infrastructures has been historically dependent on various types of devices and equipment that are being revolutionized with digitalized solutions. The digitalization of conventional healthcare equipment is added with the new inclusion of numerous new devices for data collection, analysis, communication, and so on. All in all, the futures digital hospitals in 5G will be exponentially more data-dependent and digital-intensive. For that, this paper looks to theorize how the security scenario in a futures digital hospital would look like, and what relevant business possibilities could emerge for cybersecurity providers in the healthcare context. In this paper, we open up discussions on business possibilities relevant to Internet of Things-mobile device management for critical infrastructures such as future digital hospital. We apply business models as a conceptual lens to analyze how cybersecurity business could evolve for 5G enabled IoT-Mobile device management providers as a cybersecurity vendor.
The healthcare sector has progressed significantly since the introduction of Internet and proliferation of network technologies . Among many issues, the use of data, availability of data, data mass, and access control of data in healthcare remain are critical for keeping healthcare services trustworthy and secure for the end users, both hospital staff and the patients. Disruptions in healthcare services would have severe effects on people’s lives. However, as hospital managers and professionals need to design their data-dependent and digital-intensive networks in a manner, which is highly secure, they also should provide the basis for uninterrupted service for business sustainability. Security is often observed as a tradeoff between risk and business gains . Investing in security is important in order to secure business-critical systems and data for meeting business goals and eventually for creating competitive advantage [3, 4].
Innovative technologies have the power to disrupt industries and prompt business transformation . The coming of fifth generation (5G) of telecommunications networks is seen to result in this kind of disruption. As we are gradually moving towards 5G, it is worthwhile to theorize how the security scenario in a futures digital hospital would look like, and what relevant business possibilities could emerge from cybersecurity in the healthcare context. From this perspective, in this paper, we open up discussions on business possibilities relevant to Internet of Things mobile device management for critical infrastructures such as future digital hospital. We apply business models as a conceptual lens to analyze how cybersecurity business could evolve for 5G enabled IoT device management providers as a cybersecurity vendor.
A futures digital hospital facility is envisioned to consist tech-aided advanced critical medical devices, intelligent information systems, digital communication tools, hundreds of handheld mobile devices (smartphones, tablets), wireless clinical wearables, in addition to thousands of smart IoT nodes [6, 7]. These devices should be fully integrated to improve staff productivity, hospital functions, patient safety and privacy, and, overall improve patient experience through secure and reliable healthcare services. However, inclusion of these various kinds of digital devices to the hospital context make the overall device network quite complex and heterogeneous . Thus, from a critical infrastructures view point, to manage, configure, update and secure the immense fleet of digital devices besides all the high-tech medical equipment, the futures digital hospital will need to redefine device management policy and services .
Mobile device management (MDM) systems are usually referred to “support centralized control of an entire fleet of mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) and mobile applications by applying and ensuring pre-defined configuration settings” [8, 9]. In the scope of this paper, we broadly use the term IoT-MDM to refer to a device management system that is capable of managing, configuring and updating both handheld mobile devices and IoT devices in combination in a centralized manner. We will briefly open up the concept of MDM and IoT-MDM.
The purpose of this study is to identify business potential for IoT-MDM service providers as cybersecurity vendor in the context of the future digital hospital. In doing so, we apply the concept of business model in order to make sense of a ICT-oriented business environment . Among various available conceptualizations, business model is considered as a boundary-spanning unit of analysis that explain the underlying business logic and the value creation and value capturing logic of an organization [11–15].
Traditionally, device management has been associated with management and configuration of handheld mobile devices , thus, mobile device management (MDM). Gartner  perceives MDM software to be a policy tool to configure and manage mobile handheld devices. They also mark that MDM services need to ensure security in reference to connectivity and content that is being transmitted. Along with surge of smart mobile devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) is growing large during the last few years and promises to flood the market with billions of devices in the coming years too . Zhang et al.  states scalability, transparency and reliability as important issues that differentiates IoT from the conventional Internet. To that end, there are several IoT platforms available currently in the market for managing, updating and configuring IoT nodes, e.g. IBM Bluemix, Cumulocity, ARM mbed OS, etc. . However, the transition raises the question about the differences and similarities between MDM and IoT device management as approaches.
Takalo  marks MDM and IoT device management to be quite close on a conceptual level: both need solution for automated management of large device fleets consisting different form factors, device models, and operating system. Additionally, such systems conceptually needs to support various communication channels like: WiFi, cellular network and Ethernet. However, on practical level, MDM is more strictly controlled by operating systems and device vendors. IoT device management, on the other hand, is characterized by multiple operating systems, multiple hardware platform variations, non-complete standards, multiple communication methods and protocols. This agile approach allows the coexistence of various types of devices and nodes in the same environment. Recently, services are appearing where MDM and IoT device management are brought together under the same platform, which in a way reduces the complexity in device management and also improves the overall security of the system.
While we are still in early phase of mass IoT deployment and 5G deployment is approaching, it is important to revisit some of the key security threats that has been identified in recent literature relevant mainly to IoT. Zhang et al. [19, 21] identified privacy preservation as a critical issue for information security in IoT ecosystems. They further state that conventional naming, identification and authentication policies need to be improved and rather needs approaching differently. Farooq et al.  look at the four layer generic IoT architecture consisting perception layer, network layer, middle-ware layer & application layer. Additionally, they offer a list of security challenges for each layer. Some of the key challenges are: unauthorized access, tag cloning, eavesdropping, spoofing, RF jamming, sinkhole attack, sleep deprivation attack, denial of service attack, malicious code injection, man-in-the-middle attack, spear-phishing attack, sniffing attack. Backman et al.  state, a comprehensive security solution needs to address endpoint security, management and monitoring security, and secure data distribution and storage.
Ortbach et al.  enumerate the drivers for adoption of MDM in organization through a quantitative analysis, reflecting three broad drivers: organization, environment, and technology. From organizational perspective, the company size, mobile IT usage, employee innovativeness with IT and BYOD (bring your own device) culture were identified as important drivers. From environmental viewpoint, regulations and other business partner influence are significant drivers for MDM adoption. Finally, from technology point of view, perceived security benefits and perceived cost of the service seems to affect the managerial attitude towards MDM adoption.
MDM systems are today a very common tool to manage users’ devices. With MDM, all mobile device types, tablets and PCs with typical operating systems can be controlled centrally . It is often thought that MDM can manage only mobile phones, but actually the MDM framework includes also users’ identities and profiles. This makes MDM a viable tool for organizations to manage their employees identities, user profiles, all devices, all applications and security controls under same system.
From an emerging technology perspective, SDN (software-defined network)/NFV (network functions virtualization) based 5G Slicing will challenge some of the traditional MDM features . Especially end-to-end security from device to IT cloud is difficult to realize with MDM. Of course, it is possible to force the use of VPN in mobile device with MDM, but many aspects of communications security will be still unsolved. Thus, 5G slicing provides new tools to control and manage the end-to-end communications flow with network functions (VNFs). In the advent of IoT, this is particularly important since the billions of IoT devices of the 2020s will have only a minimal processing power and memory compared to the smart phones of today. These IoT devices may connect to network only once a month and communicate only with network edge cloud servers. Therefore, managing these new IoT devices cannot be done with conventional MDM systems of today.
Fortunately, many features of MDM can be provided by dedicated 5G slices and their VNFs. If e.g. a IoT device does not have the latest anti-virus updates, the network slice may still provide the isolation and security controls so that the IoT device can send the metering data. Moreover, if the IP flow from the IoT device includes other than actual metering data, eg. due to malware in IoT device, this IP flow can be analyzed and filtered by slice specific VNFs before passing it to IoT could.
As a summary, it can be argued that SDN/NFV based 5G Slicing will provide new tools for security management, and, when combined with IoT-MDM system functionalities, together these can deliver a better device management framework for different kinds of user devices of the 2020s.
Hospital organizations are considered as critical infrastructure (CI) to nation states [3, 25]. As a critical infrastructure, hospital organizations are prone to security threats that can affect health policies, public health, healthcare services, surgical procedures, electronic patient records, patient privacy, doctor-patient communication, etc. Lehto and Ahokangas  notes, new technology (e.g. next generation mobile networks, smart data storage, IoT) adoption of CIs increases the cybersecurity touchpoints and hence making the CIs more vulnerable. Broadly, from cybersecurity perspective, the hospital organizations in future will be vulnerable from management perspective (e.g. organizing healthcare services, managing huge amount of patient data, clinical data, medication data, communication between health professional and patients etc.), healthcare service delivery perspective (e.g. in an unwelcoming case of denial of service attacks in hospital context: like wannacry), network perspective (e.g. security of the overall hospital network), and last but not the least from an individual privacy perspective (e.g. individual patient records, healthcare professional logs, etc.).
A futures digital hospital will consist various advanced technologies, such as critical medical devices, intelligent information systems and digital communication tools, which are fully integrated to improve staff productivity, hospital operations, patient safety, and the overall patient experience. Among them, many will be wireless mobile devices, wireless wearables and thousands of smart IoT devices for various kinds of measurements .
Innovations help transform healthcare in forms of advanced telecommunications techonology, new drugs and treatments like biological sensor pills or implants, new medical devices, social media interation, etc. [1, 6, 7]. In future, hospitals and surgical tools will be revolutionized with intelligence and connectivity i.e. providing more assistive functions by sensors, processors, data collection, software algorithms and interfaces which are, for example, embedded in the tools that will support surgeon’s decision-making in action . Robotic-assisted Surgery (RAS) can be considered as a good example of such transformation. The rapid adoption of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) and today’s information revolution not only improves the surgical outcomes and patient’s life but also changes the patient-physician relationship.
‘Smart’ i.e. IoT-based technologies are going to intellectualize medical devices and service systems into Smart Hospitals. Smart hospitals extrapolate from totally digitalized and automated data collection, tracking and delivery between systems, devices, patients, and health professionals and organization . In future, it is also envisioned that virtual hospitals and personalized medication will become part of patient care. Patients will be able to visit virtual hospitals or e-clinincs for clinical purposes without the presence of health professionals, but procedures and communication are managed via remote management and telemedicine solutions .
Other features that futures digital hospitals will include: use of different AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality) applications for healthcare related purposes. While VR applications are quickly evolving in the gaming industry, some applications are deemed suitable in hospital environment too. Patients can be introduced to hospital environment through VR solutions, which can reduce patient stress prior to surgical procedures . Another application of VR in healthcare has been identified as rehabilitation support for temporary physical disabilities and mental trauma. Further, AR solutions can help patients navigate within a large hospital complex.
The term, Business model, has had its root in information systems (IS) and information communication technology (ICT) since the late 1970s originating from business informatics. However, it came into management and strategic management literature as a research interest from the mid-1990s [29, 30]. Although business model had its roots in IS and ICT, the amount of research work on cyber security as a context is still quite negligible harnessing the potential of business model concept.
The concept of business models lies at the intersection of entrepreneurship and strategy, it can be observed as a bridge between abstract strategies and the practical implementation of strategic decisions and actions amidst the uncertainties of the modern business context [11–14, 31]. For instance, Zott and Amit  conceptualize business model as a ‘boundary-spanning’ set of activities aimed at creating and appropriating value. Morris et al.  viewed the concept of the business model as a set of decisions related to the venture strategy, architecture, and economics of firm (value creation and capture) that need addressing to create sustainable competitive advantage in the chosen markets and specific contexts.
As a boundary-spanning unit of analysis, business models , connects an organization with its business environment, other organizations, customers, individuals and society as well; with the overall ecosystem at large [34, 35]. Trying to bridge business models and cyber security under current context, there are two core issues. First, as almost all of the entities operating within the digital sphere face multifaceted cyber threats, how can business model approach help organizations to respond to such situations? Second, how can business model approach help to identify opportunities and monetize security in future 5G? In the next two sub-chapters, we present two business model approaches that are suitable for ICT contexts, and, can help find answers to the above mentioned questions.
As the mobile telecommunications industry advanced, so did business model related discussions in the literature about extending organizational boundaries through vertical and horizontal integration in industries . Around this, Wirtz et al.  offered four mutually exclusive business models classifying Internet based business models to be precise. According to Wirtz et al. , these business models present in Web 2.0 are related to connection, content, context, and commerce. Building further, Yrjölä et al.  interpreted these business models as chronological layers, where “lower” layer business models are pre-requisites for the “higher” layer business models to exist.
Figure 1 The layered 4C ICT business models archetypes [Adapted from 35, 37, 38].
The first layer is concerned with connection-related business model where a stakeholder provides connection services . Connection- related business models are relevant to connectivity for all sorts of devices and nodes through various communication channels, e.g. PCs, smartphones, tablets, IoT devices, etc. The second layer is the business model focusing on monetizing content. At the content layer, all sorts of online content services (e.g. mobile video streaming) are classified (i.e. relevant, up-to-date and interesting) and are accessible conveniently for the end user. The content might be peer-to-peer/user-oriented contents (i.e. exchange of personal content), and web browsing content (audio, video, text etc.).
The third, context, layer concerns the ability to create and monetize user, content, equipment/user device and system profiles and turn (big) data into meaningful information and knowledge through systemic virtual contextualization. The fourth layer concerns commerce, the ability to monetize any or all of the connection, content, or context specific resources, actors or activities related to the ongoing communications. At this layer, we identify business, consumer and public/government types of communications . Thus, B2B (business-to-business), B2C and B2G communications as well as C2B, C2C and C2G or G2B, G2C and G2G communications may be monetized at this layer.
Casdesus-Masanell and Llanes’s  offers different software business models based on the openness of core software and extension software offering. According to the mixed source software business model approach, services can be: open source (open core- open extension), open core (open core- closed extension), open extensions (closed core- open extension) and proprietary (closed core- closed extension). Although this model was offered specifically suiting the software industry, we argue that similar approach can be useful in other ICT contexts to scale up value offering by adjusting cooperation and industrial partnering model.
Figure 2 Mixed source business model approach [Adapted form 40].
Depending on individual organization’s choice of mixed source options, it should eventually translate the value creation and value capture logic of the firm. Casadesus-Masanell & Llanes  argues that purely proprietary models results in higher captured value for organizations but lessens the scope of value creation for users. In contrast, purely open source models can deliver the maximum value to customers but reduce captured value. The key for organizations is to locate the best mix of openness-closeness for an optimum level of value capture and creation. From the business model elements collection, the mixed source approach explain key partners, key activities, key resources and technologies used. From a strategic perspective, this approach to business modeling helps an organization to find a way to scale up or down its business activities.
This study concerns business possibilities of IoT and mobile device management in the context of futures digital hospital. Since future is elusive and the speed of technology advancements has been rapid during recent decades, we consider the most suitable method for conducting this research to be through qualitative approach. Qualitative methods helps with flexibility and sensitivity to the context that is less explored, and it can facilitate understanding of how things work in a particularly complex setting . We adopt a single qualitative case study approach for this research to explain underlying business potential of a scantly explored industrial context within the existing literature .

Table 1 summarizes the data used for this research. The empirical data used for this study was collected through two streams. First, in order to build the conceptual case of future digital hospitals, five interviews were conducted with pediatric surgery specialists, a nurse, and a general physician from two hospital districts in Finland. These semi-structured interviews were organized between April and May 2016. These interviews also focused on understanding the journey path in a pediatrics surgery case to clarify suitability of digitalization in the future. However, in the scope of this paper, we do not discuss the patient journey pediatrics surgery in detail. Second, we explored the cybersecurity and business perspectives in two workshops that were organized with telecommunications and cybersecurity experts from the industry. One of the workshops were organized in November 2016. The other workshop took place in August 2017. While the futures digital hospital context from a security perspective relates more towards hospital management and network functionality, the IoT devices and mobile devices perspective is closer to end user security needs. This paper focuses on the cyber security related business opportunities through IoT-MDM systems/services that broadly covers the above mentioned domains. Findings and analysis from the interviews and workshops are presented next.
In this section, we present our analysis in four steps. First, we briefly discuss the relevance of Internet business models (4C)  to the context of the study, addressing how this approach can help cybersecurity providers identify business opportunities in IoT-MDM. Second, we present a 4-quadrant matrix reflecting four different 5G security-provisioning scenarios, which are also relevant to IoT-MDM. Then, we connect each scenario back to business models by applying a mixed-source business model approach  and identify different possible business models for each kind of cybersecurity provider. Finally, we connect the overall discussion back to the case of future digital hospital.
The 4C business model archetypes helps decoding the boundaries between multiple business models operating either in the same verticals of the ecosystem or in the same horizontals. These archetypes can provide with a basis to classify and analyze business models of suppliers, competitors, and, at the same time, business models of customers. For this case, the 4C business model archetypes are mostly relevant for cybersecurity providers and IoT-MDM system/service providers as a tool to analyze customer business models and identify customer needs, the hospital management style. These customer needs can eventually be turned around as business opportunities. While IoT-MDM systems and services are not only concerned about cybersecurity, there is room for service providers to customize and tailor services based on customer needs. These service providers either can target customers from one layer (connection/content/context/commerce) across multiple industries, or, they can also target a specific industry (e.g. healthcare) create customized services for all the layers in that industry.
To make sense of the overall cybersecurity provisioning for future 5G, we created the 4-quadrant matrix (Figure 3) by identifying major security drivers for new business creation in future 5G. These scenarios were created in workshops with telecommunication & cybersecurity experts from the industry. While these service provisioning scenarios are relevant to overall 5G, they are also significantly related to the case of IoT-MDM system/services.
Figure 3 Scenarios for 5G cybersecurity provisioning [Adapted from 35].
As a result, we find four major drivers of security, which potentially will come with new business opportunities in the 5G era. Device driven security comprises distributed and D2D security techniques. Platform driven security will focus on centralized and D2D security techniques. Whereas, network infrastructure driven security should focus on centralized and infrastructure security methods. Lastly, location driven security should harness distributed and infrastructure security techniques.
In a quest to identify potential business entities operating in each of the quadrants relevant to device management, we recognize a ‘secure device manufacturer/provider’ focuses on device-driven security. Currently, multiple device manufacturers are developing devices where security features are built-in, regardless of which network or websites the users are accessing. This built-in security can be offered to multiple kinds of devices including smartphones, tablets, pcs, wearables, and even to IoT devices with communication and computation capability. These secure devices are built in a way that it will control access to potentially harmful networks, websites, and content; even without any commercially available security applications installed. However, when a customer enterprise (e.g. the future digital hospital) is buying a fleet of hundreds of such secure devices, the question raises how to manage and configure all these devices from time-to-time. In such a case, even the secure devices will need IoT-MDM services for proper management and seamless upgrading when needed.
For the platform-driven security, we observe a ‘traditional IoT-MDM system provider’ can be a good example. In many cases, IoT-MDM system providers are selling there device management systems to enterprises directly. And, in other cases, they are selling the service through MNO’s bundled with connectivity and/or infrastructure. While as network infrastructure-driven security, a ‘mobile network operator/carrier’ or a ‘network infrastructure vendor’ can build own IoT-MDM system to offer their clients as well. And, finally, a location-specific micro operator can offer location-driven security. Micro operators offer mobile connectivity combined with specific, local services. The operation of a micro operator is spatially confined to either its premises or to a defined area of operation. As a part of the location-specific services, these micro operators can also offer IoT-MDM services for the users through outsourcing.
Further, we attempt to connect the aforementioned classification and examples of different players offering IoT-MDM services with the mixed source business model approach. Table 2 summarizes our understanding on how each kind of cybersecurity provider can open and mix the core value creation logic for end users. As mentioned previously, the mixed-source business model options are: open source (open core, open extensions), open core (open core, closed extensions), open extensions (closed core, open extensions), and proprietary (closed core, closed extensions). In relation to these mixed-source options, we analyze the plausible options for each of the four distinct cybersecurity providers in the context of this study.
Secure device manufacturer/provider Secure devices Proprietary (own device, own IoT-MDM platform), Open extensions (own device, outsourced IoT-MDM service).
From a secure device manufacturer perspective, device business can be considered as the core operation whereas IoT-MDM services would be extended solution. A secure device manufacturer/provider can have either a proprietary model or an open extensions model. In the proprietary model, the secure device manufacturer will offer their own devices alongwith their own IoT-MDM system/service. This is a viable case in a sense that customers who are purchasing the fleet of secure devices might prefer the IoT-MDM service from the same vendor, which is ideally less risk prone. Generally, when a customer organization buys a fleet of secure devices, they would expect the device management functions to be offered by the same service provider since integration of multiple systems/interfaces might increase vulnerability and reduce the customer’s confidence on the system. However, in practice, not all secure device manufacturer will specialize in automated device management solutions, and new R&D expenses to develop the IoT-MDM systems could result to be financially unfeasible. So, the second option for a secure device manufacturer is to have an open extensions model, where they will still offer the secure devices but outsource the IoT-MDM services to other vendors.
A micro operator’s core business relates to location specific network, while they are offering additional location specific services as extensions. Ideally, a micro operator’s business model in this case can be considered to be open source. At one hand micro operators are dependent on appropriate available spectrum resources on carriers and NIVs, and on the other hand, outsourcing the IoT-MDM services to other vendors seems more economically feasible than building own system. In contrast, a traditional IoT-MDM system/ service provider can have either a direct-open extensions business model or an indirect-open extensions business model. Unlike the other three archetypes in this discussion, IoT-MDM system/services are the core business for this kind of actor, as device and network related issues can be considered as extensions. An IoT-MDM system/service provider is characteristically dependent on connectivity providers, i.e. MNOs, NIVs. In a direct-open extensions business model, while they are selling the IoT-MDM service directly to the end users, they are using the operator connectivity, but delivering their core value directly. Alternatively, in an indirect-open extensions business model, these IoT-MDM vendors can sell the services through MNOs/NIVs/device vendors to the end users.
Finally, a mobile network operator can either have an open extensions business model, or less likely a proprietary business model for IoT-MDM services. In an open extensions business model, operators will offer own connectivity to end users while outsourcing the IoT-MDM service to vendors. In very few cases though, operators might have their own IoT-MDM system on offering and thus they can sell both connectivity and IoT-MDM service as a proprietary bundle.
Looking back at the case of futures digital hospital, it is deemed to comprise various advanced technology-aided devices, let it be for clinical purposes or communications purpose that support healthcare. With the presence of devices like smartphones, tablets, wearables, connected TVs, VR touchpoints, AR touchpoints, robotic assistance for surgeries, thousands of smart IoT devices, makes the overall device network of the digital hospital complex and need automated centralized management. This centralized management of numerous IoT and mobile devices can be delivered through IoT-MDM system/services. Using the IoT-MDM system/service, the hospital organization can configure, secure, and time-to-time update their device network.
While procuring IoT-MDM services, the above analysis shows that futures digital hospitals can source it either directly from IoT-MDM service providers or through MNOs. Alternatively, if a digital hospital also plays the role of a micro operator, besides offering other location-specific services, the micro operator can also offer device management services by sourcing it from other vendors. In other cases, the future digital hospital can procure fleet of secure devices for the hospital from whom they can also source the device management service as a bundle. From the 4C business models perspective, the hospital organization seems to be a single organizational entity where different activities can be categorized in the 4C layers. Cybersecurity providers can specify and address such issues to highlight and customize their service offering for the future digital hospital.
In this article, we have looked at the futures digital hospital context from a device management perspective, and attempted to portray business model options based on how to create and capture economic value from cybersecurity business. Though in this research, we adopt a high-level stance on cybersecurity from a technical perspective, the overall discussions on business potential are relevant to issues like information security, communication security, storage security, security at vulnerable touchpoints in hospital context (end user interface layer, IoT nodes, system layer, network layer).
Futures digital hospitals will be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats because of its data-dependency and digital-intensive device network. Thus, the business opportunity for cybersecurity providers in this case can be considered as the need for automated and centralized IoT-MDM service. To that end, this paper presents four distinct players who can provide such service to a critical infrastructure like a digital hospital. The mixed-source business model options further open up multiple alternatives that each type of vendor can consider while tailoring services for the future digital hospital . This paper also connects the 4C ICT business model archetypes to cybersecurity business context which can be used as an analytical tool to identify customer needs and scope for value creation .
Academically, this work contributes by filling up the void in discussing business models for cybersecurity as an industry. In addition, in the existing literature the hospital context has also been less discussed from a cybersecurity business perspective. From an industrial point of view, the business model options discussed in this research are timely and relevant to the market context and need. As mentioned, the mixed source business model options show how cybersecurity providers can extend their offering for different kinds of need for the hospital context based on their core businesses. This study can prove to be helpful for cybersecurity business entities and at the same time hospital managers. The scope of this paper explains business potential of cybersecurity vendors to an emerging industry from a higher level. In this paper, authors do not attempt to analyze the technical aspect of cyber security provisioning in healthcare context, however that is a forthcoming research possibility of this study. Also, since this research is based on a conceptual phenomenon, thus its empirical validation, both qualitatively and quantitatively is still yet to come, which can be considered as a limitation of the study.
All in all, we consider that applying a business perspective to IoT-MDM systems can solve many challenges of a modern mobile IT environment, not only in healthcare but also in other kinds of critical infrastructures . These IoT-MDM systems can be provided by various kind of vendors through a balanced and timely business model.

As we are gradually moving towards 5G, it is worthwhile to theorize how the security scenario in a futures digital hospital would look like. We apply business models as a conceptual lens to analyze how cybersecurity business could evolve for 5G enabled IoT-Mobile device management providers as a cybersecurity vendor. The future digital hospital facility is envisioned to consist of tech-aided advanced critical medical devices, intelligent information systems, digital communication tools, hundreds of handheld mobile devices (smartphones, tablets), wireless clinical wearables, in addition to thousands of smart IoT nodes. These devices should be fully integrated to improve staff productivity, hospital functions, patient safety and privacy, and, overall improve patient experience through secure and reliable healthcare services. It is important to secure business-critical systems and data for meeting business goals and eventually for creating competitive advantage. The purpose of this study is to identify business potential for IoT-MDM service providers as cybersecurity vendor. In doing so, we apply the concept of business model in order to make sense of a ICT-oriented business environment. The transition raises the question about the differences and similarities between MDM and IoT device management as approaches. Some of the key challenges are: unauthorized access, tag cloning, eavesdropping, spoofing, RF jamming, sinkhole attack, sleep deprivation attack, denial of service attack, malicious code injection, man-in-the-middle attack, spear-phishing attack, sniffing attack. Backman et al. state, a comprehensive security solution needs to address endpoint security, management and monitoring security, and secure data distribution and storage. It is important to revisit some of thekey security threats that has been identified in recent literature relevant mainly to the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G deployment is approaching. MDM systems are today a very common tool to manage users’ devices. With MDM, all mobile device types, tablets and PCs with typical operating systems can be controlled centrally. SDN/NFV based 5G Slicing will provide new tools for security management. When combined with IoT-MDM system functionalities, together these can deliver a better device management framework for different kinds of user devices of the 2020s. It is often thought that MDM can manage only mobile phones. But actually the MDM framework includes also users' identities and profiles. This makes MDM a viable tool for organizations to manage their employees identities, user profiles, all devices, all applications and security controls under same system. It's possible to force the use of VPN in mobile device with MDM. But many aspects of communications security will be still unsolved. 5G slicing provides new tools to control and manage the end-to-end communications flow with network functions (VNFs) igital hospital will consist various advanced technologies, such as critical medical devices, intelligent information systems and digital communication tools. Among them, many will be wireless mobile devices, wireless wearables and thousands of smart IoT devices for various kinds of measurements. In future, it is also envisioned that virtual hospitals and personalized medication will become part of patient care. Patients will be able to visit virtual hospitals or e-clinincs for clinical purposes without the presence of health professionals, but procedures and communication are managed via remote management and telemedicine solutions. Other features that futures digital hospitals will include: use of different AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality) applications for healthcare related purposes. The term, Business model, has had its root in information systems (IS) and information communication technology (ICT) since the late 1970s originating from business informatics. Although business model had its roots in IS and ICT, the amount of research work on cyber security as a context is still quite negligible. There are two core issues. Trying to bridge business models and cyber security under current context. How can business model approach help to identify opportunities and monetize security in future 5G? In the next two sub-chapters, we present two business model approaches that are suitable for ICT contexts, and, can help find answers to the above mentioned questions.

We are happy to clarify that this was not the case, and that the work was in fact based on a different approach. We would like to make it clear that we are referring to the approach of Casadesus-Masanell & Llanes, not WirtZ & Ylä, and we are happy with their work. This study concerns business possibilities of IoT and mobile device management in the context of futures digital hospital. The empirical data used for this study was collected through two streams. Five interviews were conducted with pediatric surgery specialists, a nurse, and a general physician from two hospital districts in Finland. We explored the cybersecurity and business perspectives in two workshops that were organized with telecommunications and cybersecurity experts from the industry. The 4C business model archetypes helps decoding the boundaries between multiple business models operating either in the same verticals of the ecosystem or the same horizontals. We present a 4-quadrant matrix reflecting four different 5G security-provisioning scenarios, which are also relevant to IoT-MDM. Then, we connect each scenario back to business models by applying a mixed-source business model approach  and identify different possible business models for each kind of cybersecurity provider. The 4C business model archetypes are mostly relevant for cybersecurity providers and IoT-MDM system/service providers. They are a tool to analyze customer business models and identify customer needs, the hospital management style. These customer needs can eventually be turned around as business opportunities. The 4-quadrant matrix was created by identifying major security drivers for new business creation in future 5G. The scenarios were created in workshops with telecommunication & cybersecurity experts from the industry and are relevant to overall 5G service provisioning as well as the case of IoT- MDM systems/services. The matrix identifies four major drivers of security, which potentially will come with new business opportunities in the 5G era, including device driven, platform driven, location driven, and network infrastructure-driven security. It also identifies examples of different players offering IoT-mdM service in each quadrant relevant to device management, and how they can be used to create customized services for different industries. Table 2 summarizes our understanding on how each kind of cybersecurity provider can open and mix the core value creation logic for end users. As mentioned previously, the mixed-source business model options are: open source (open core, open extensions), open core, closed extensions, and proprietary. A secure device manufacturer/provider can have either a proprietary model or an open extensions model. A traditional IoT-MDM system/services are the core business for this kind of actor, as device and network related issues can be considered as extensions. A micro operator’s core business relates to location specific network, while they are offering additional location specific services as Extensions. W. with the mixed source business model approach. We analyze the plausible options for each of the four distinct cybersecurity providers in the context of this study. We conclude with a look at how we see the future of cybersecurity in the digital hospital. We hope this will help you understand how the cybersecurity industry will change in the future. Futures digital hospitals will be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats because of its data-dependency and digital-intensive device network. Cybersecurity providers can specify and address such issues to highlight and customize their service offering for the future digital hospital. This paper also connects the 4C ICT business model archetypes to cybersecurity business context which can be used as an analytical tool to identify customer needs and scope for value creation.

abstract

Dialect Identification is a crucial task for localizing various Large Language Models. This paper outlines our approach to the VarDial 2023 DSL-TL shared task. Here we have to identify three or two dialects from three languages each which results in a 9-way classification for Track-1 and 6-way classification for Track-2 respectively.
Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage system and outperforms other participants' systems and previous works in this domain. We achieve a score of 58.54% for Track-1 and 85.61% for Track-2. Our codebase is available publicly 1 .

Introduction

Language has been the primary mode of communication for humans since the pre-historic ages. Studies have explored the evolution of language and outlined mathematical models that govern the intricacies of natural language . Inevitably, as humans established civilization in various parts of the world, this language was modified by, and for the group of people occupied by that particular geographical region.
This gave rise to multiple national dialects of the same language. The VarDial workshop (colocated with EACL 2023) explores various dialects and variations of the same language. We participated in the Discriminating Between Similar Languages -True Labels (DSL-TL) shared task. In this task, the participants were provided with data from three languages, with each language having three varieties.
This shared task consisted of two tracks -Track-1 featuring nine-way classification and Track-2 featuring six-way classification. The second track included two particular national dialects of each language (eg. American English and British English), and the first track had one general  We ranked 1 st in both of the tracks.
Moreover, we beat the next best submission by a margin of 4.5% in the first task and 5.6% in the second task.We were the only team to surpass the organizer baseline scores. We present our winning solution in this paper. We used an end-to-end deep learning pipeline which consisted of a language identification model and three language-specific models, one for each language.
We converged upon the best combination by doing an elaborate analysis of various models available. Furthermore, in this work we also analyze the performance of the pipeline as a whole and also provide an ablation study. Lastly, we provide some future directions in this area of research.

Related Work

The present literature encompasses various aspects of dialect identification. We study this from three perspectives: large language models, language identification and dialect classification problems.

Large Language Models

The success of transformers and BERT based models was inevitable since the initial boom of the transformer  2017) model. In recent years, many other architectures like RoBERTa and ELECTRA have further pushed the state-of-the-art in this domain. Moreover, autoregressive models like GPT and GPT-2 have also shown their prowess.
Multilingual versions of RoBERTA, namely XLM-RoBERTa are also available. Lastly, language specific models like Spanish BERT (la Rosa y Eduardo G. Ponferrada y Manu Romero y Paulo Villegas y Pablo González de Prado Salas y María Grandury, 2022) and Portuguese BERT are available as well. Our winning solution makes use of these large language models trained on specific languages.

Language Identification Models

Many multilingual language identification models have been developed in order to classify the language of the input sentence beforehand. Even though the initial works used n-gram models and generative mixture models or even conditional random fields and other classical machine learning methods like naive bayes , modern methods have shifted to the use of deep learning for language identification .
Recent works have mainly focused on deep learning based language identification, where handling codemixed data is a big challenge in the domain. For our experiments, we use a version of XLM-RoBERTa finetuned on a language identification dataset 2 . This model has near-perfect test accuracy of 99.6%.

Dialect Classification

Dialect classification has been previously solved using statistical methods like Gaussian Mixture Models and Frame Selection Decoding or Support Vector Machines (SVM) . It has been explored relatively sparsely, mostly in the case for local languages . Deep learning approaches have been explored in previous editions of the VarDial workshop shared tasks and otherwise .
Dialect classification was also explored previously as a part of other shared tasks . We want to stress that given the multilingual nature of the dataset, using the present methods directly was not an option. In our work, although we take inspiration from the previous works, we propose a novel system that surpasses the performance of the previous systems by a large margin.

Data

The dataset  We observed that the class PT-BR had the most number of samples (2,724) and the class EN had the least number of samples (349), and thus the imbalance ratio was almost 1:8. We have illustrated the data distribution in Figure . We tried to mitigate this imbalance using over-sampling and weighted sampling methods.
However, the improved data sampling method did not affect the performance.

System Description

This was a problem of multi-class classification having 9 classes for Track-1 and 6 classes for Track-2. The samples were belonging to 3 languages having 3 varieties each, so the classification pipeline was made in 2 stages. The Language Identification (LID) model which is the first stage classifies the sentence into 3 languages: English (EN), Spanish (ES) and Portuguese (PT).
The LID is a pretrained XLM-RoBERTa that is fine-tuned for the task of language identification. It is able to classify the input sentence into 20 languages. We classify and separate the samples according to their language. The samples corresponding to the specific languages are then fed into the language specific models for dialect identification.
For dialect identification we have used models like BERT and RoBERTa with a linear layer connected to the pooler output of the models. Then fine-tuning is done on the models for dialect identification   using the samples corresponding to the specific languages. For the task of dialect identification we experimented with several pretrained models like XLM-RoBERTa, BERT, ELECTRA, GPT-2 and RoBERTa.
All models were fine-tuned for 20 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-6 and weight decay 1e-6 with a batch size of 8. The best performing model checkpoint was chosen according to the epoch-wise validation macro-F1 score. 5 Experiments and Results

Experiments using Large Language Models

For the task of Dialect Identification we have tried various language specific models like XLM-RoBERTa, BERT, ELECTRA, RoBERTa and GPT- 2. The base variant of all these models were used and all the models were used through the Hugging-Face library. The pooler output of these models was passed through a linear layer and the models were fine-tuned.
First, we experimented with different models for Track-1. All the models were trained for 20 epochs with learning rate 1e-6, weight decay 1e-6 and a batch size of 8. We used XLM-RoBERTa as the baseline for all 3 languages. The best performing models for the English language were RoBERTa and BERT whereas GPT-2 was the worst performing.
Similarly the language specific versions of RoBERTa and BERT performed well for the Spanish and Portuguese respectively. Overall the worst performing model was GPT-2 across all 3 languages. The validation F1 scores are present in Table . The two best-performing models for every language were chosen for Track-2.
The same procedure as specified above was used and the F1 scores are present in Table . The train and validation F1 scores for 2-class classification are higher for all models as compared to the F1 score of the same models for 3-class classification. This was mainly due to the poor representation and accuracy of classification of the third class.
We observed symptoms of overfitting in all models after 12-15 epochs and the best validation F1 score was obtained in the range of 4-8 epochs.

LID experiments

The pipeline for dialect identification is divided into two parts as the sentences in the dataset belong to different languages. The stages are described in Section 4. The XLM-RoBERTa we have used for language classification has a test accuracy of 99.6% meaning it correctly classifies all input sentences and hence, can be considered as a perfect classifier.
For the final pipeline we experimented using the two best performing models for each language in Track-1 and Track-2. For both the tracks we experimented with all 8 (2 3 ) possible combinations of models and calculated the validation F1 score for the combined validation dataset which had sentences belonging to all languages.
The validation scores for Track-1 and Track-2 are shown in Table and Table respectively. For both the tracks, the three pipelines with the best validation F1 scores were chosen for submission.

Using 3-way classifier as a 2-way classifier

In Track-1, participants are expected to train a classifier which classifies amongst 9 classes, and in Track-2, participants are expected to train a classifier which classifies amongst 6 classes. These 6 classes are a proper subset of the 9 classes from Track-1. Thus, an intuitive baseline for Track-2 is to use the model finetuned for Track-1, whilst considering only the relevant classes for the latter task.
The classes EN , ES and P T , i.e. the classes without any national dialect associated with them are not included in Track-2 as compared to Track-1. Thus, we calculate the predictions for the Track-2 validation dataset using the models for Track-1 and exclude the metrics for Track-1 specific classes to get the metrics for this ""adapted"" 2-way classification.
We show the results of this experiment in Table and observe that, as expected, the adapted 2-way classification performs worse compared to the explicitly finetuned variant.

Results for Track-1 and Track-2

We now present our experiments and their performance for both tracks. Our experiments for Track-1 are described in Table and our experiments for Track-2 are described in Table . The participants were allowed three submissions for evaluation on the test set, so we submitted predictions using the three systems which performed the best on the validation set.
As mentioned in Section 5.2, we performed 2 3 , i.e. a total of 8 experiments using the two best models for each language. We observed that RoBERTa base on English, Spanish BERT base on Spanish and Portuguese BERT base performed the best on the testing set for Track-1. The same combination, with RoBERTa base for English, worked best for Track-2.
All of our submissions were the top submissions for each track, which surpassed the next best competitors by a margin of 4.5% and 5.6% for Track-1 and Track-2 respectively.

Ablation of best submissions

We hereby make some observations of our submissions and other experiments. To assist this, we plot the confusion matrices of our best submissions for Track-1 and Track-2 in Figures respectively. Note that these confusion matrices have their rows (i.e. true labels axes) normalized according to the number of samples in the class.
Here are observations from our experiments: 1. BERT-based models outperform other models across all languages: We observe that BERT-based models outperform ELECTRA-based and GPT-2-based models, as shown in Table . We speculate this is because of the inherent architecture of BERT, which combines semantic learning with knowledge retention.
This combination of traits is particularly useful for this task. 2. Common labels perform the worst across all languages: We observe that the common labels EN , ES and P T perform the worst, both in the individual as well as the two-stage setup. We hypothesize this is because of the absence of dialect specific words, or words that are specific to the geographical origin of the national dialect (for example, ""Yankees"" for EN-US and ""Oxford"" for EN-GB).
3. English models work better than models of other languages: It can be noted from Figures 4 and 3 that the English models have the best performance across all classes. This can be attributed to two reasons: absence of national dialect specific words and lesser pretraining data in the case of Portuguese.
4. British English is most correctly classified class: We can observe that the Spanish or Portuguese models make equal number of mistakes in the case of either national dialect, in the case of Track-2 (see Figure ). However, in the case of English, the label EN − GB is correctly classified for more than 95% of the cases.
We speculate this is because British English involves slightly distinctive grammar and semantics, which help the model separate it from other classes. 5. The proposed 2-step method is scalable for multiple language dialect classification: We can strongly assert that the novel 2-step deep learning method for multilingual dialect classification is a scalable method for the task due to two specific reasons: firstly, the multilingual models (like XLM-RoBERTa) might not have the vocabulary as well as the learning capabilities to learn the minute differences between individual dialects.
Secondly, this system can be quickly expanded for a new language by simply adding a language specific dialect classifier, provided the language identification model supports that particular language.

Conclusion

In this paper we propose a two-stage classification pipeline for dialect identification for multilingual corpora. We conduct thorough ablations on this setup and provide valuable insights. We foresee multiple future directions for this work. The first is to expand this work to many languages and dialects.
Secondly, it is a worthwhile research direction to distill this multi-model setup into a single model with multiple prediction heads. The obvious limitation of this system is the excessive memory consumption due to the usage of language specific models. For low resource languages this system is difficult to train and scale.
We hope that these problems will be addressed by researchers in future works.","['BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, GPT-2, and XLM-RoBERTa.']",2397,multifieldqa_en,en,,635ad5e3696e0d297f3ea8909d42975a5c1eb49a7f4a8466," The LID classifies the input into one of 3 languages.

【従来の技術】試料を処理する真空処理装置は、大別すると、カセットブロックと真空処理ブロックから構成されており、カセットブロックは、半導体製造ラインのベイ通路に面して長手方向に伸びるフロントを有し、試料用のカセットや試料のオリエンテーションを合わせるアライメントユニットと、大気ロボットがある。 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Vacuum processing apparatus for processing a sample, the roughly is constituted by a cassette block and a vacuum processing block, the cassette block, a front extending in the longitudinal direction facing the bay aisle of a semiconductor manufacturing line a, an alignment unit for aligning the cassette and sample orientation for sample, there is an atmospheric robot. 真空処理ブロックには、ロード側ロードロック室，アンロード側ロードロック室，真空処理室，後真空処理室，真空ポンプ及び真空ロボット等が設けられている。 The vacuum processing block, the load-side load lock chamber, the unload side load lock chamber, the vacuum processing chamber, a rear vacuum processing chamber, a vacuum pump and a vacuum robot and the like.
【０００３】これらの真空処理装置では、カセットブロックのカセットから取り出された試料が、大気ロボットにより真空処理ブロックのロードロック室まで搬送される。  In these vacuum processing apparatus, a sample taken from the cassette in the cassette block is transported to the load lock chamber in the vacuum processing block by the atmospheric robot. ロードロック室から真空ロボットによりさらに処理室に搬送され、電極構造体上にセットされた試料は、プラズマエッチング等の処理がなされる。 Is conveyed from the load lock chamber to the further processing chamber by the vacuum robot, the sample is set on an electrode structure, processing such as plasma etching is performed. その後、必要に応じて後真空処理室に搬送，処理される。 Thereafter, the conveyance to the rear vacuum processing chamber as necessary and processed. 処理済みの試料は、真空ロボット及び大気ロボットによりカセットブロックのカセットに搬送される。 Processed sample is conveyed to the cassette of the cassette block by the vacuum robot and the atmospheric robot.
【０００４】試料をプラズマエッチング処理する真空処理装置の例としては、例えば特公昭61−8153号公報，特開昭63−133532号公報，特公平6−30369号公報，特開平  Examples of the sample vacuum processing apparatus for plasma etching treatment, for example Japanese Patent Publication 61-8153, JP-Sho 63-133532 and JP Kokoku 6-30369, JP-A No.

5,314,509号明細書および5,784,799号明細書に記載されたようなものがある。 There are such as described in Pat and 5,784,799 Pat 5,314,509.
509号明細書に記載された装置は、真空処理ブロックの中央付近に真空ロボット、その周囲に３個の処理室が同心状に配置され、真空ロボットとカセットブロックの間に、ロード側ロードロック室，アンロード側ロードロック室が設けられている。 Device described in 509 Pat are vacuum robot in the vicinity of the center of the vacuum processing block, three process chambers around it are arranged concentrically, between the vacuum robot and the cassette block, the load-side load-lock chamber , unload side load lock chamber is provided. これらの装置では、大気ロボットや真空ロボットの搬送アームの回転角度が大きく従って装置全体の必要床面積が大きいという問題がある。 In these devices, there is a problem that needs floor space for the entire rotation angle is large therefore device of the transfer arm of the atmospheric robot and the vacuum robot is large.
【０００６】一方、真空処理装置の真空処理ブロック内の処理室や真空ポンプその他各種の配管機器については、定期，不定期に点検修理等のメンテナンスを行うことが必要である。  On the other hand, the processing chamber and the vacuum pump and other various piping components of the vacuum processing block of the vacuum processing apparatus, periodically, it is necessary to perform maintenance such as inspection and repair irregularly. そのため、一般に、真空処理ブロックの周囲には、扉が設けられており、この扉を開けることにより、ロードロック室，アンロードロック室，処理室，真空ロボット及び各種の配管機器の点検修理ができるようになっている。 Therefore, in general, around the vacuum processing block, the door is provided by opening the door, load lock chambers, unload lock chambers, processing chambers, the servicing of the vacuum robot and various piping devices It has become way.
キャリアポッドが必要となるために、約３５０mm程度と大きくなり、複数のキャリアポッドを収納するカセットブロックの幅も大きくなる。 For carrier pod required, large as about 350 mm, the greater width of the cassette block for housing a plurality of carrier pods. この幅に合わせて真空処理ブロックの幅を決定すると、真空処理装置全体が大きなスペースを必要とすることになる。 When determining the width of the vacuum processing block in accordance with the this width, the entire vacuum processing apparatus requires a large space. 一例として、４個のキャリアポッドを収納するカセットブロックについて考えると、試料の直径ｄが８インチから１２インチになった場合、カセットの幅は少なくとも約４０cm以上大きくならざるを得ない。 As an example, considering the cassette block for accommodating four carriers pods, if the diameter d of the sample was a 12-inch 8 inch wide cassette inevitably increases at least about 40cm or more.
【０００８】一方、試料に各種の処理を行いながら大量の処理を行うために、一般の半導体製造ラインでは、同じ処理を行う複数の真空処理装置を同じベイに集め、各ベイ間の搬送を自動またはマニュアルで行っている。 On the other hand, in order to perform a lot of processing while performing various processes in the sample, in a general semiconductor manufacturing lines, gathering a plurality of vacuum processing apparatus for performing the same processing in the same bay, automatic conveyance between the bays or it is carried out manually. このような半導体製造ラインは、高いクリーン度を必要とするため、半導体製造ライン全体が大きなクリーンルーム内に設置される。 Such a semiconductor manufacturing line, requires a high degree of cleanliness, the whole semiconductor manufacturing line is placed in a large clean room. 試料の大口径化に伴う真空処理装置の大型化は、クリーンルーム占有面積の大型化を伴うが、これはもともと建設コストの高いクリーンルームの建設コストを一層増加させることになる。 Size of the vacuum processing apparatus due to the large diameter of the sample is accompanied by a large clean room area occupied, which will be further increased construction costs of the high construction cost clean room originally. もし、同じ面積のクリーンルームに占有面積の大きな真空処理装置を設置するとすれば、真空処理装置の全体の台数を減らすか、あるいは各真空処理装置間の間隔を狭くせざるを得ない。 If, if the clean room of the same area to install a large vacuum processing apparatus of the occupied area, reduce the overall number of the vacuum processing apparatus, or interval narrower forced between the vacuum processing apparatus. 同じ面積のクリーンルームにおける真空処理装置の設置台数減少は、必然的に半導体の製造ラインの生産性の低下ひいては半導体の製造コストの上昇を伴う。 Installed base reduction in the vacuum processing apparatus in a clean room having the same area is accompanied inevitably rise of the semiconductor decrease and thus the semiconductor manufacturing cost of productivity of the production line. 他方、各真空処理装置間の間隔を狭くすることは、点検修理のためのメンテナンススペースが不足し、真空処理装置のメンテナンス性を著しく阻害する。 On the other hand, to reduce the distance between each of the vacuum processing apparatus, the maintenance space for inspection and repair is insufficient to significantly inhibit the maintenance of the vacuum processing apparatus.
【０００９】本発明の目的は、試料の大口径化に対応しつつ、製造コストの上昇を抑えることのできる真空処理装置を提供することにある。 An object of the present invention, while corresponding to the large diameter of the sample, is to provide a vacuum processing apparatus capable of suppressing an increase in manufacturing cost.
【００１０】本発明の他の目的は、試料の大口径化に対応しつつ、メンテナンス性に優れた真空処理装置を提供することにある。 Another object of the present invention, while corresponding to the large diameter of the sample is to provide a vacuum processing apparatus having excellent maintainability.
【００１１】本発明の他の目的は、試料の大口径化に対応しつつ、真空処理装置の必要設置台数を確保して製造コストの上昇を抑え、かつ、メンテナンス性も損なわない半導体製造ラインを提供することにある。 Another object of the present invention, while corresponding to the large diameter of the sample, to ensure the necessary number of installed vacuum processing apparatus suppressing an increase in manufacturing cost, and a semiconductor manufacturing line is not impaired maintainability It is to provide.

How many massive star-forming regions were studied?,"\section{Introduction}

Spectral line surveys have revealed that high-mass star-forming
regions are rich reservoirs of molecules from simple diatomic species
to complex and larger molecules (e.g.,
\citealt{schilke1997b,hatchell1998b,comito2005,bisschop2007}).
However, there have been rarely studies undertaken to investigate the
chemical evolution during massive star formation from the earliest
evolutionary stages, i.e., from High-Mass Starless Cores (HMSCs) and
High-Mass Cores with embedded low- to intermediate-mass protostars
destined to become massive stars, via High-Mass Protostellar Objects
(HMPOs) to the final stars that are able to produce Ultracompact H{\sc
  ii} regions (UCH{\sc ii}s, see \citealt{beuther2006b} for a recent
description of the evolutionary sequence). The first two evolutionary
stages are found within so-called Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs).  While
for low-mass stars the chemical evolution from early molecular
freeze-out to more evolved protostellar cores is well studied (e.g.,
\citealt{bergin1997,dutrey1997,pavlyuchenkov2006,joergensen2007}),
it is far from clear whether similar evolutionary patterns are present
during massive star formation.

To better understand the chemical evolution of high-mass star-forming
regions we initiated a program to investigate the chemical properties
from IRDCs to UCH{\sc ii}s from an observational and theoretical
perspective. We start with single-dish line surveys toward a large
sample obtaining their basic characteristics, and then perform
detailed studies of selected sources using interferometers on smaller
scales. These observations are accompanied by theoretical modeling of
the chemical processes.  Long-term goals are the chemical
characterization of the evolutionary sequence in massive star
formation, the development of chemical clocks, and the identification
of molecules as astrophysical tools to study the physical processes
during different evolutionary stages. Here, we present an initial
study of the reactive radical ethynyl (C$_2$H) combining single-dish
and interferometer observations with chemical modeling.  Although
C$_2$H was previously observed in low-mass cores and Photon Dominated
Regions (e.g., \citealt{millar1984,jansen1995}), so far it was not
systematically investigated in the framework of high-mass star
formation.

\section{Observations}
\label{obs}

The 21 massive star-forming regions were observed with the Atacama
Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) in the 875\,$\mu$m window in fall 2006.
We observed 1\,GHz from 338 to 339\,GHz and 1\,GHz in the image
sideband from 349 to 350\,GHz.  The spectral resolution was
0.1\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but we smoothed the data to
$\sim$0.9\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The average system temperatures were around
200\,K, each source had on-source integration times between 5 and 16
min. The data were converted to main-beam temperatures with forward
and beam efficiencies of 0.97 and 0.73, respectively
\citep{belloche2006}. The average $1\sigma$ rms was 0.4\,K.  The main
spectral features of interest are the C$_2$H lines around 349.4\,GHz
with upper level excitation energies $E_u/k$ of 42\,K (line blends of
C$_2$H$(4_{5,5}-3_{4,4})$ \& C$_2$H$(4_{5,4}-3_{4,3})$ at
349.338\,GHz, and C$_2$H$(4_{4,4}-3_{3,3})$ \&
C$_2$H$(4_{4,3}-3_{3,2})$ at 349.399\,GHz). The beam size was $\sim
18''$.

The original Submillimeter Array (SMA) C$_2$H data toward the
HMPO\,18089-1732 were first presented in \citet{beuther2005c}. There
we used the compact and extended configurations resulting in good
images for all spectral lines except of C$_2$H. For this project, we
re-worked on these data only using the compact configuration. Because
the C$_2$H emission is distributed on larger scales (see
\S\ref{results}), we were now able to derive a C$_2$H image. The
integration range was from 32 to 35\,km\,s$^{-1}$, and the achieved
$1\sigma$ rms of the C$_2$H image was 450\,mJy\,beam$^{-1}$.  For more
details on these observations see \citet{beuther2005c}.

\section{Results}
\label{results}

The sources were selected to cover all evolutionary stages from IRDCs
via HMPOs to UCH{\sc ii}s. We derived our target list from the samples
of \citet{klein2005,fontani2005,hill2005,beltran2006}.  Table
\ref{sample} lists the observed sources, their coordinates, distances,
luminosities and a first order classification into the evolutionary
sub-groups IRDCs, HMPOs and UCH{\sc ii}s based on the previously
available data. Although this classification is only based on a
limited set of data, here we are just interested in general
evolutionary trends. Hence, the division into the three main classes
is sufficient.

Figure \ref{spectra} presents sample spectra toward one source of each
evolutionary group. While we see several CH$_3$OH lines as well as
SO$_2$ and H$_2$CS toward some of the HMPOs and UCH{\sc ii}s but not
toward the IRDCs, the surprising result of this comparison is the
presence of the C$_2$H lines around 349.4\,GHz toward all source types
from young IRDCs via the HMPOs to evolved UCH{\sc ii}s.  Table
\ref{sample} lists the peak brightness temperatures, the integrated
intensities and the FWHM line-widths of the C$_2$H line blend at
349.399\,GHz. The separation of the two lines of 1.375\,MHz already
corresponds to a line-width of 1.2\,km\,s$^{-1}$. We have three C$_2$H
non-detections (2 IRDCs and 1 HMPO), however, with no clear trend with
respect to the distances or the luminosities (the latter comparison is
only possible for the HMPOs). While IRDCs are on average colder than
more evolved sources, and have lower brightness temperatures, the
non-detections are more probable due to the relatively low sensitivity
of the short observations (\S\ref{obs}). Hence, the data indicate
that the C$_2$H lines are detected independent of the evolutionary
stage of the sources in contrast to the situation with other
molecules.  When comparing the line-widths between the different
sub-groups, one finds only a marginal difference between the IRDCs and
the HMPOs (the average $\Delta v$ of the two groups are 2.8 and
3.1\,km\,s$^{-1}$).  However, the UCH{\sc ii}s exhibit significantly
broader line-widths with an average value of 5.5\,km\,s$^{-1}$.

Intrigued by this finding, we wanted to understand the C$_2$H spatial
structure during the different evolutionary stages.  Therefore, we
went back to a dataset obtained with the Submillimeter Array toward
the hypercompact H{\sc ii} region IRAS\,18089-1732 with a much higher
spatial resolution of $\sim 1''$ \citep{beuther2005c}.  Albeit this
hypercompact H{\sc ii} region belongs to the class of HMPOs, it is
already in a relatively evolved stage and has formed a hot core with a
rich molecular spectrum.  \citet{beuther2005c} showed the spectral
detection of the C$_2$H lines toward this source, but they did not
present any spatially resolved images. To recover large-scale
structure, we restricted the data to those from the compact SMA
configuration (\S\ref{obs}). With this refinement, we were able to
produce a spatially resolved C$_2$H map of the line blend at
349.338\,GHz with an angular resolution of $2.9''\times 1.4''$
(corresponding to an average linear resolution of 7700\,AU at the
given distance of 3.6\,kpc). Figure \ref{18089} presents the
integrated C$_2$H emission with a contour overlay of the 860\,$\mu$m
continuum source outlining the position of the massive protostar. In
contrast to almost all other molecular lines that peak along with the
dust continuum \citep{beuther2005c}, the C$_2$H emission surrounds the
continuum peak in a shell-like fashion.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

To understand the observations, we conducted a simple chemical
modeling of massive star-forming regions. A 1D cloud model with a mass
of 1200\,M$_\sun$, an outer radius of 0.36\,pc and a power-law density
profile ($\rho\propto r^p$ with $p=-1.5$) is the initially assumed
configuration. Three cases are studied: (1) a cold isothermal cloud
with $T=10$\,K, (2) $T=50$\,K, and (3) a warm model with a temperature
profile $T\propto r^q$ with $q=-0.4$ and a temperature at the outer
radius of 44\,K. The cloud is illuminated by the interstellar UV
radiation field (IRSF, \citealt{draine1978}) and by cosmic ray
particles (CRP). The ISRF attenuation by single-sized $0.1\mu$m
silicate grains at a given radius is calculated in a plane-parallel
geometry following \citet{vandishoeck1988}. The CRP ionization rate is
assumed to be $1.3\times 10^{-17}$~s$^{-1}$ \citep{spitzer1968}. The
gas-grain chemical model by \citet{vasyunin2008} with the desorption
energies and surface reactions from \citet{garrod2006} is used.
Gas-phase reaction rates are taken from RATE\,06 \citep{woodall2007},
initial abundances, were adopted from the ``low metal'' set of
\citet{lee1998}.

Figure \ref{model} presents the C$_2$H abundances for the three models
at two different time steps: (a) 100\,yr, and (b) in a more evolved
stage after $5\times10^4$\,yr. The C$_2$H abundance is high toward the
core center right from the beginning of the evolution, similar to
previous models (e.g., \citealt{millar1985,herbst1986,turner1999}).
During the evolution, the C$_2$H abundance stays approximately
constant at the outer core edges, whereas it decreases by more than
three orders of magnitude in the center, except for the cold $T=10$~K
model.  The C$_2$H abundance profiles for all three models show
similar behavior.

The chemical evolution of ethynyl is determined by relative removal
rates of carbon and oxygen atoms or ions into molecules like CO, OH,
H$_2$O. Light ionized hydrocarbons CH$^+_{\rm n}$ (n=2..5) are quickly
formed by radiative association of C$^+$ with H$_2$ and hydrogen
addition reactions: C$^+$ $\rightarrow$ CH$_2^+$ $\rightarrow$
CH$_3^+$ $\rightarrow$ CH$_5^+$.  The protonated methane reacts with
electrons, CO, C, OH, and more complex species at later stage and
forms methane.  The CH$_4$ molecules undergo reactive collisions with
C$^+$, producing C$_2$H$_2^+$ and C$_2$H$_3^+$. An alternative way to
produce C$_2$H$_2^+$ is the dissociative recombination of CH$_5^+$
into CH$_3$ followed by reactions with C$^+$.  Finally, C$_2$H$_2^+$
and C$_2$H$_3^+$ dissociatively recombine into CH, C$_2$H, and
C$_2$H$_2$. The major removal for C$_2$H is either the direct
neutral-neutral reaction with O that forms CO, or the same reaction
but with heavier carbon chain ions that are formed from C$_2$H by
subsequent insertion of carbon. At later times, depletion and
gas-phase reactions with more complex species may enter into this
cycle.  At the cloud edge the interstellar UV radiation
instantaneously dissociates CO despite its self-shielding,
re-enriching the gas with elemental carbon.

The transformation of C$_2$H into CO and other species proceeds
efficiently in dense regions, in particular in the ``warm'' model
where endothermic reactions result in rich molecular complexity of the
gas (see Fig.~\ref{model}).  In contrast, in the ``cold'' 10\,K model
gas-grain interactions and surface reactions become important.  As a
result, a large fraction of oxygen is locked in water ice that is hard
to desorb ($E_{\rm des} \sim 5500$~K), while half of the elemental
carbon goes to volatile methane ice ($E_{\rm des} \sim 1300$~K). Upon
CRP heating of dust grains, this leads to much higher gas-phase
abundance of C$_2$H in the cloud core for the cold model compared to
the warm model. The effect is not that strong for less dense regions
at larger radii from the center.

Since the C$_2$H emission is anti-correlated with the dust continuum
emission in the case of IRAS\,18089-1732 (Fig.\,\ref{18089}), we do
not have the H$_2$ column densities to quantitatively compare the
abundance profiles of IRAS\,18089-1732 with our model. However, data
and model allow a qualitative comparison of the spatial structures.
Estimating an exact evolutionary time for IRAS\,18089-1732 is hardly
possible, but based on the strong molecular line emission, its high
central gas temperatures and the observed outflow-disk system
\citep{beuther2004a,beuther2004b,beuther2005c}, an approximate age of
$5\times10^4$\,yr appears reasonable.  Although dynamical and chemical
times are not necessarily exactly the same, in high-mass star
formation they should not differ to much: Following the models by
\citet{mckee2003} or \citet{krumholz2006b}, the luminosity rises
strongly right from the onset of collapse which can be considered as a
starting point for the chemical evolution. At the same time disks and
outflows evolve, which should hence have similar time-scales.  The
diameter of the shell-like C$_2$H structure in IRAS\,18089-1732 is
$\sim 5''$ (Fig.\,\ref{18089}), or $\sim$9000\,AU in radius at the
given distance of 3.6\,kpc.  This value is well matched by the modeled
region with decreased C$_2$H abundance (Fig.\,\ref{model}).  Although
in principle optical depths and/or excitation effects could mimic the
C$_2$H morphology, we consider this as unlikely because the other
observed molecules with many different transitions all peak toward the
central submm continuum emission in IRAS\,18089-1732
\citep{beuther2005c}. Since C$_2$H is the only exception in that rich
dataset, chemical effects appear the more plausible explanation.

The fact that we see C$_2$H at the earliest and the later evolutionary
stages can be explained by the reactive nature of C$_2$H: it is
produced quickly early on and gets replenished at the core edges by
the UV photodissociation of CO. The inner ``chemical'' hole observed
toward IRAS\,18089-1732 can be explained by C$_2$H being consumed in
the chemical network forming CO and more complex molecules like larger
carbon-hydrogen complexes and/or depletion.

The data show that C$_2$H is not suited to investigate the central gas
cores in more evolved sources, however, our analysis indicates that
C$_2$H may be a suitable tracer of the earliest stages of (massive)
star formation, like N$_2$H$^+$ or NH$_3$ (e.g.,
\citealt{bergin2002,tafalla2004,beuther2005a,pillai2006}). While a
spatial analysis of the line emission will give insights into the
kinematics of the gas and also the evolutionary stage from chemical
models, multiple C$_2$H lines will even allow a temperature
characterization. With its lowest $J=1-0$ transitions around 87\,GHz,
C$_2$H has easily accessible spectral lines in several bands between
the 3\,mm and 850\,$\mu$m.  Furthermore, even the 349\,GHz lines
presented here have still relatively low upper level excitation
energies ($E_u/k\sim42$\,K), hence allowing to study cold cores even
at sub-millimeter wavelengths.  This prediction can further be proved
via high spectral and spatial resolution observations of different
C$_2$H lines toward young IRDCs.

The data indicate that the peak brightness temperatures, the integrated.intensities and the FWHM line-widths of the lines at 349.399 \,GHz are independent of evolutionary stages.

What is the average magnetic moment per column in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films?,"\section{introduction}
In the past few years, the synthesis of ferromagnetic semiconductors has become a major challenge for spintronics. Actually, growing a magnetic and semiconducting material could lead to promising advances like spin injection into non magnetic semiconductors, or electrical manipulation of carrier induced magnetism in magnetic semiconductors \cite{ohno00,Bouk02}. Up to now, major efforts have focused on diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) in which the host semiconducting matrix is randomly substituted by transition metal (TM) ions such as Mn, Cr, Ni, Fe or Co \cite{Diet02}. However Curie temperatures ($T_{C}$) in DMS remain rather low and TM concentrations must be drastically raised in order to increase $T_{C}$ up to room temperature. That usually leads to phase separation and the formation of secondary phases. It was recently shown that phase separation induced by spinodal decomposition could lead to a significant increase of $T_{C}$ \cite{Diet06,Fuku06}. For semiconductors showing $T_{C}$ higher than room temperature one can foresee the fabrication of nanodevices such as memory nanodots, or nanochannels for spin injection. Therefore, the precise control of inhomogeneities appears as a new challenge which may open a way to industrial applications of ferromagnetism in semiconductors.

The increasing interest in group-IV magnetic semiconductors can also be explained by their potential compatibility with the existing silicon technology. In 2002, carrier mediated ferromagnetism was reported in  MBE grown Ge$_{0.94}$Mn$_{0.06}$ films by Park \textit{et al.} \cite{Park02}. The maximum critical temperature was 116 K. Recently many publications indicate a significant increase of $T_{C}$ in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ material depending on growth conditions \cite{Pint05,Li05,tsui03}. Cho \textit{et al.} reported a Curie temperature as high as 285 K \cite{Cho02}. 
Taking into account the strong tendency of Mn ions to form intermetallic compounds in germanium, a detailed investigation of the nanoscale structure is required. Up to now, only a few studies have focused on the nanoscale composition in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films. Local chemical inhomogeneities have been recently reported by Kang \textit{et al.} \cite{Kang05} who evidenced a micrometer scale segregation of manganese in large Mn rich stripes. Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ as well as Ge$_8$Mn$_{11}$ clusters embedded in a germanium matrix have been reported by many authors. However, Curie temperatures never exceed 300 K \cite{Bihl06,Morr06,Pass06,Ahle06}. Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ clusters exhibit a Curie temperature of 296 K \cite{Mass90}. This phase frequently observed in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films is the most stable (Ge,Mn) alloy. The other stable compound Ge$_8$Mn$_{11}$ has also been observed in nanocrystallites surrounded with pure germanium \cite{Park01}. Ge$_8$Mn$_{11}$ and Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ phases are ferromagnetic but their metallic character considerably complicates their potential use as spin injectors.
Recently, some new Mn-rich nanostructures have been evidenced in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ layers. Sugahara \textit{et al.} \cite{Sugh05} reported the formation of high Mn content (between 10 \% and 20 \% of Mn) amorphous Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ precipitates  in a Mn-free germanium matrix. Mn-rich coherent cubic clusters were observed by Ahlers \textit{et al.} \cite{Ahle06} which exhibit a Curie temperatures below 200 K. Finally, high-$T_{C}$ ($>$ 400 K) Mn-rich nanocolumns have been evidenced \cite{Jame06} which could lead to silicon compatible room temperature operational devices.\\
In the present paper, we investigate the structural and magnetic properties of Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ thin films for low growth temperatures ($<$ 200$^{\circ}$C) and low Mn concentrations (between 1 \% and 11 \%). By combining TEM, x-Ray diffraction and SQUID magnetometry, we could identify different magnetic phases. We show that depending on growth conditions, we obtain either Mn-rich nanocolumns or Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters embedded in a germanium matrix. We discuss the structural and magnetic properties of these nanostructures as a function of manganese concentration and growth temperature. We also discuss the magnetic anisotropy of nanocolumns and  
Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ clusters. 

\section{Sample growth}

Growth was performed using solid sources molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) by co-depositing Ge and Mn evaporated from standard Knudsen effusion cells.  Deposition rate was low ($\approx$ 0.2 \AA.s$^{-1}$). Germanium substrates were epi-ready Ge(001) wafers with a residual n-type doping and resistivity of 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ and 5 $\Omega.cm$ respectively. After thermal desorption of the surface oxide, a 40 nm thick Ge buffer layer was grown at 250$^{\circ}$C, resulting in a 2 $\times$ 1 surface reconstruction as observed by reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) (see Fig. 1a). Next, 80 nm thick Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films were subsequently grown  at low substrate temperature (from 80$^{\circ}$C to 200$^{\circ}$C). Mn content has been determined by x-ray fluorescence measurements performed on thick samples ($\approx$ 1 $\mu m$ thick) and complementary Rutherford Back Scattering (RBS) on thin Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films grown on silicon. Mn concentrations range from 1 \% to 11\% Mn.

For Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films grown at substrate temperatures below 180$^{\circ}$C, after the first monolayer (ML) deposition, the  2 $\times$ 1 surface reconstruction almost totally disappears. After depositing few MLs, a slightly diffuse 1 $\times$ 1 streaky RHEED pattern and a very weak 2 $\times$ 1 reconstruction (Fig. 1b) indicate a predominantly two-dimensional growth. For growth temperatures above 180$^{\circ}$C additional spots appear in the RHEED pattern during the Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ growth (Fig. 1c). These spots may correspond to the formation of very small secondary phase crystallites. The nature of these crystallites will be discussed below.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were performed using a JEOL 4000EX microscope with an acceleration voltage of 400 kV. Energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) was done using a JEOL 3010 microscope equipped with a Gatan Image Filter . Sample preparation was carried out by standard mechanical polishing and argon ion milling for cross-section investigations and plane views were prepared by wet etching with H$_3$PO$_4$-H$_2$O$_2$ solution \cite{Kaga82}.

\label{fig2}
\end{figure}

In samples grown at 130$^{\circ}$C and containing 6 \% Mn, we can observe vertical elongated nanostructures \textit{i.e.} nanocolumns as shown in Fig. 2a. Nanocolumns extend through the whole Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ film thickness. From the high resolution TEM image shown in Fig. 2b, we deduce their average diameter around 3 nm. Moreover in Fig. 2b, the interface between the Ge buffer layer and the Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ film is flat and no defect propagates from the interface into the film. The Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ film is a perfect single crystal in epitaxial relationship with the substrate. In Fig. 2c is shown a plane view micrograph of the same sample confirming the presence of nanocolumns in the film. From this image, we can deduce the size and density of nanocolumns. The nanocolumns density is 13000 $\rm{\mu m}^{-2}$ with a mean diameter of 3 nm which is coherent with cross-section measurements. In order to estimate the chemical composition of these nanocolumns, we further performed chemical mapping using EFTEM. In Fig. 2d we show a cross sectional Mn chemical map of the Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ film. This map shows that the formation of nanocolumns is a consequence of Mn segregation. Nanocolumns are Mn rich and the surrounding matrix is Mn poor. However, it is impossible to deduce the Mn concentration in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ nanocolumns from this cross section. Indeed, in cross section observations, the columns diameter is much smaller than the probed film thickness and the signal comes from the superposititon of the Ge matrix and Mn-rich nanocolumns. In order to quantify Mn concentration inside the nanocolumns and inside the Ge matrix, EELS measurements (not shown here) have been performed in a plane view geometry \cite{Jame06}. These observations revealed that the matrix Mn content is below 1 \% (detection limit of our instrument). Measuring the surface occupied by the matrix and the nanocolumns in plane view TEM images, and considering the average Mn concentration in the sample (6 \%), we can estimate the Mn concentration in the nanocolumns. The Mn concentration measured by EELS being between 0\% and 1\%, we can conclude that the Mn content in the nanocolumns is between 30 \% and 38 \%.\\
For samples grown between 80$^\circ$C and 150$^\circ$C cross section and plane view TEM observations reveal the presence of Mn rich nanocolumns surrounded with a Mn poor Ge matrix. In order to investigate the influence of Mn concentration on the structural properties of Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films, ten samples have been grown at 100$^\circ$C and at 150$^\circ$C with Mn concentrations of 1.3 \%, 2.3 \%, 4 \%, 7 \% and 11.3 \%. Their structural properties have been investigated by plane view TEM observations.

 \label{fig3}
\end{figure}

For samples grown at 100$^\circ$C with Mn concentrations below 5 \% the nanocolumns mean diameter is 1.8$\pm$0.2 nm. The evolution of columns density as a fonction of Mn concentration is reported in figure 3b. By increasing the Mn concentration from 1.3 \% to 4 \% we observe a significant increase of the columns density from 13000 to 30000 $\rm{\mu m}^{-2}$. For Mn concentrations higher than 5 \% the density seems to reach a plateau corresponding to 35000 $\rm{\mu m}^{-2}$ and their diameter slightly increases from 1.8 nm at 4 \% to 2.8 nm at 11.3 \%. By plotting the volume fraction occupied by the columns in the film as a function of Mn concentration, we observe a linear dependence for Mn contents below 5 \%. The non-linear behavior above 5 \% may indicate that the mechanism of Mn incorporation is different in this concentration range, leading to an increase of Mn concentration in the columns or in the matrix. For samples grown at 100$^\circ$C, nanocolumns are always fully coherent with the surrounding matrix (Fig. 4a). 

Increasing the Mn content in the samples grown at 150$^\circ$C from 1.3 \% to 11.3 \% leads to a decrease of the columns density (fig 3b). Moreover, their average diameter increases significantly and size distributions become very broad (see Fig. 3a). For the highest Mn concentration (11.3 \%) we observe the coexistence of very small columns with a diameter of 2.5 nm and very large columns with a diameter of 9 nm. In samples grown at 150$^\circ$C containing 11.3 \% of Mn, the crystalline structure of nanocolumns is also highly modified. In plane view TEM micrographs, one can see columns exhibiting several different crystalline structures. We still observe some columns which are fully coherent with the Ge matrix like in the samples grown at lower temperature. Nevertheless, observations performed on these samples grown at 150$^\circ$C and with 11.3\% Mn reveal some uniaxially \cite{Jame06} or fully relaxed columns exhibiting a misfit of 4 \% between the matrix and the columns and leading to misfit dislocations at the interface between the column and the matrix (see fig. 4b). Thus we can conclude that coherent columns are probably in strong compression and the surrounding matrix in tension. On the same samples (T$_g$=150$^{\circ}$C, 11.3\% Mn), we also observe a large number of highly disordered nanocolumns leading to an amorphous like TEM contrast(fig. 4c).

(c) Amorphous nanocolumn. These columns are typical in samples grown at 150$^{\circ}$C with high Mn contents.}
 \label{fig4}
\end{figure}

In conclusion, we have evidenced a complex mechanism of Mn incorporation in Mn doped Ge films grown at low temperature. In particular Mn incorporation is highly inhomogeneous. For very low growth temperatures (below 120$^\circ$C) the diffusion of Mn atoms leads to the formation of Mn rich, vertical nanocolumns. Their density mostly depends on Mn concentration and their mean diameter is about 2 nm. These results can be compared with the theoretical predictions of Fukushima \textit{et al.} \cite{Fuku06}: they proposed a model of spinodal decomposition in (Ga,Mn)N and (Zn,Cr)Te based on layer by layer growth conditions and a strong pair attraction between Mn atoms which leads to the formation of nanocolumns. This model may also properly describe the formation of Mn rich nanocolumns in our samples. Layer by layer growth conditions can be deduced from RHEED pattern evolution during growth. For all the samples grown at low temperature, RHEED observations clearly indicate two-dimensional growth. Moreover, Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge heterostructures have been grown and observed by TEM (see Fig. 5). Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge (as well as Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$) interfaces are very flat and sharp thus confirming a two-dimensional, layer by layer growth mode. Therefore we can assume that the formation of Mn rich nanocolumns is a consequence of 2D-spinodal decomposition.

Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ layers are 15 nm thick and Ge spacers 5 nm thick. We clearly see the sharpness of both Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$/Ge and Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ interfaces. Mn segregation leading to the columns formation already takes place in very thin Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films.}
\label{fig5}
\end{figure}

For growth temperatures higher than 160$^\circ$C, cross section TEM and EFTEM observations (not shown here) reveal the coexistence of two Mn-rich phases: nanocolumns and Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ nanoclusters embedded in the germanium matrix. A typical high resolution TEM image is shown in figure 6. 
Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters are not visible in RHEED patterns for temperatures below 180$^\circ$C. To investigate the nature of these clusters, we performed x-ray diffraction in $\theta-2\theta$ mode. Diffraction scans were acquired on a high resolution diffractometer using the copper K$_\alpha$ radiation and on the GMT station of the BM32 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Three samples grown at different temperatures and/or annealed at high temperature were investigated. The two first samples are Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films grown at 130$^\circ$C and 170$^\circ$C respectively. The third one has been grown at 130$^\circ$C and post-growth annealed at 650$^\circ$C. By analysing x-ray diffraction spectra, we can evidence two different crystalline structures. For the sample grown at 130$^\circ$C, the $\theta-2\theta$ scan only reveals the (004) Bragg peak of the germanium crystal, confirming the good epitaxial relationship between the layer and the substrate, and the absence of secondary phases in the film in spite of a high dynamics of the order of 10$^7$. For both samples grown at 170$^\circ$C and annealed at 650$^\circ$C, $\theta-2\theta$ spectra are identical. In addition to the (004) peak of germanium, we observe three additional weak peaks. The first one corresponds to the (002) germanium forbidden peak which probably comes from a small distortion of the germanium crystal, and the two other peaks are respectively attributed to the (002) and (004) Bragg peaks of a secondary phase. The $c$ lattice parameter of Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ hexagonal crystal is 5.053 \AA \ \cite{Fort90} which is in very good agreement with the values obtained from diffraction data for both (002) and (004) lines assuming that the $c$ axis of Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ is along the [001] direction of the Ge substrate.

\end{figure}

In summary, in a wide range of growth temperatures and Mn concentrations, we have evidenced a two-dimensional spinodal decomposition leading to the formation of Mn-rich nanocolumns in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films. This decomposition is probably the consequence of: $(i)$ a strong pair attraction between Mn atoms, $(ii)$ a strong surface diffusion of Mn atoms in germanium even at low growth temperatures and $(iii)$ layer by layer growth conditions. We have also investigated the influence of growth parameters on the spinodal decomposition: at low growth temperatures (100$^{\circ}$C), increasing the Mn content leads to higher columns densities while at higher growth temperatures (150$^{\circ}$C), the columns density remains nearly constant whereas their size increases drastically. By plotting the nanocolumns density as a function of Mn content, we have shown that the mechanism of Mn incorporation in Ge changes above 5 \% of Mn. Finally, using TEM observations and x-ray diffraction, we have shown that Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ nanoclusters start to form at growth temperatures higher than 160$^\circ$C.

\section{Magnetic properties \label{magnetic}}

We have thoroughly investigated the magnetic properties of thin Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films for different growth temperatures and Mn concentrations. In this section, we focus on Mn concentrations between 2 \% and 11 \%. We could clearly identify four different magnetic phases in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films : diluted Mn atoms in the germanium matrix, low $T_{C}$ nanocolumns ($T_{C}$ $\leq$ 170 K), high $T_{C}$ nanocolumns ($T_{C}$ $\geq$ 400 K) and Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters ($T_{C}$ $\thickapprox$ 300 K). The relative weight of each phase clearly depends on the growth temperature and to a lesser extend on Mn concentration. For low growth temperature ($<$ 120$^{\circ}$C), we show that nanocolumns are actually made of four uncorrelated superparamagnetic nanostructures. Increasing T$_{g}$ above 120$^{\circ}$C, we first obtain continuous columns exhibiting low $T_{C}$ ($<$ 170 K) and high $T_{C}$ ($>$ 400 K) for $T_{g}\approx$130$^{\circ}$C. The larger columns become ferromagnetic \textit{i.e.} $T_{B}>T_{C}$. Meanwhile Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters start to form. Finally for higher $T_{g}$, the magnetic contribution from Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters keeps increasing while the nanocolumns signal progressively disappears.

The magnetic field is applied in the film plane. The inset shows the temperature dependence of a sample grown at 130$^{\circ}$C and annealed at 650$^{\circ}$C for 15 minutes. After annealing, the magnetic signal mostly arises from Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters. (b) ZFC-FC measurements performed on Ge$_{0.93}$Mn$_{0.07}$ samples for different growth temperatures. The in-plane applied field is 0.015 T. The ZFC peak at low temperature ($\leq$150 K) can be attributed to the superparamagnetic nanocolumns. This peak widens and shifts towards high blocking temperatures when increasing growth temperature. The second peak above 150 K in the ZFC curve which increases with increasing growth temperature is attributed to superparamagnetic Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters. The increasing ZFC-FC irreversibility at $\approx$ 300 K is due to the increasing contribution from large ferromagnetic Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters. The nanocolumns signal completely vanishes after annealing at 650$^{\circ}$C for 15 minutes.}
\label{fig7}
\end{figure}

In Fig. 7a, the saturation magnetization at 2 Tesla in $\mu_{B}$/Mn of Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films with 7 \% of Mn is plotted as a function of temperature for different growth temperatures ranging from $T_{g}$=90$^{\circ}$C up to 160$^{\circ}$C. The inset shows the temperature dependence of the magnetization at 2 Tesla after annealing at 650$^{\circ}$C during 15 minutes. Figure 7b displays the corresponding Zero Field Cooled - Field Cooled (ZFC-FC) curves recorded at 0.015 Tesla. In the ZFC-FC procedure, the sample is first cooled down to 5 K in zero magnetic field and the susceptibility is subsequently recorded at 0.015 Tesla while increasing the temperature up to 400 K (ZFC curve). Then, the susceptibility is recorded under the same magnetic field while decreasing the temperature down to 5 K (FC curve). Three different regimes can be clearly distinguished. \\
For $T_{g}\leq$120$^{\circ}$C, the temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization remains nearly the same while increasing growth temperature. The overall magnetic signal vanishing above 200 K is attributed to the nanocolumns whereas the increasing signal below 50 K originates from diluted Mn atoms in the surrounding matrix. The Mn concentration dependence of the saturation magnetization is displayed in figure 8. For the lowest Mn concentration (4 \%), the contribution from diluted Mn atoms is very high and drops sharply for higher Mn concentrations (7 \%, 9 \% and 11.3 \%). Therefore the fraction of Mn atoms in the diluted matrix decreases with Mn concentration probably because Mn atoms are more and more incorporated in the nanocolumns. In parallel, the Curie temperature of nanocolumns increases with the Mn concentration reaching 170 K for 11.3 \% of Mn. This behavior may be related to different Mn compositions and to the increasing diameter of nanocolumns (from 1.8 nm to 2.8 nm) as discussed in section \ref{structural}.

    \caption{Temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization (in $\mu_{B}$/Mn) of Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films grown at 100$^{\circ}$C plotted for different Mn concentrations: 4.1 \%; 7 \%; 8.9 \% and 11.3 \%.}
\label{fig8}
\end{figure}

ZFC-FC measurements show that the nanocolumns are superparamagnetic. The magnetic signal from the diluted Mn atoms in the matrix is too weak to be detected in susceptibility measurements at low temperature. In samples containing 4 \% of Mn, ZFC and FC curves superimpose down to low temperatures. As we do not observe hysteresis loops at low temperature, we believe that at this Mn concentration nanocolumns are  superparamagnetic in the whole temperature range and the blocking temperature cannot be measured. For higher Mn contents, the ZFC curve exhibits a very narrow peak with a maximum at the blocking temperature of 15 K whatever the Mn concentration and growth temperature (see Fig. 7b). Therefore the anisotropy barrier distribution is narrow and assuming that nanocolumns have the same magnetic anisotropy, this is a consequence of the very narrow size distribution of the nanocolumns as observed by TEM. To probe the anisotropy barrier distribution, we have performed ZFC-FC measurements but instead of warming the sample up to 400 K, we stopped at a lower temperature $T_{0}$.

\caption{Schematic drawing of the anisotropy barrier distribution n($E_{B}$) of superparamagnetic nanostructures. If magnetic anisotropy does not depend on the particle size, this distribution exactly reflects their magnetic size distribution. In this drawing the blocking temperature ($T_{B}$) corresponds to the distribution maximum. At a given temperature $T_{0}$ such that 25$k_{B}T_{0}$ falls into the anisotropy barrier distribution, the largest nanostructures with an anisotropy energy larger than 25$k_{B}T_{0}$ are blocked whereas the others are superparamagnetic.}
\label{fig9}
\end{figure}

If this temperature falls into the anisotropy barrier distribution as depicted in Fig. 9, the FC curve deviates from the ZFC curve. Indeed the smallest nanostructures have become superparamagnetic at $T_{0}$ and when decreasing again the temperature, their magnetization freezes along a direction close to the magnetic field and the FC susceptibility is higher than the ZFC susceptibility. Therefore any irreversibility in this procedure points at the presence of superparamagnetic nanostructures. The results are given in Fig. 10a. ZFC and FC curves clearly superimpose up to $T_{0}$=250 K thus the nanocolumns are superparamagnetic up to their Curie temperature and no Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters could be detected. Moreover for low $T_{0}$ values, a peak appears at low temperature in FC curves which evidences strong antiferromagnetic interactions between the nanocolumns \cite{Chan00}.

\end{figure}

In order to derive the magnetic size and anisotropy of the Mn-rich nanocolumns embedded in the Ge matrix, we have fitted the inverse normalized in-plane (resp. out-of-plane) susceptibility: $\chi_{\parallel}^{-1}$ (resp. $\chi_{\perp}^{-1}$). The corresponding experimental ZFC-FC curves are reported in Fig. 10b. Since susceptibility measurements are performed at low field (0.015 T), the matrix magnetic signal remains negligible. In order to normalize susceptibility data, we need to divide the magnetic moment by the saturated magnetic moment recorded at 5 T. However the matrix magnetic signal becomes very strong at 5 T and low temperature so that we need to subtract it from the saturated magnetic moment using a simple Curie function. From Fig. 10b, we can conclude that nanocolumns are isotropic. Therefore to fit experimental data we use the following expression well suited for isotropic systems or cubic anisotropy: $\chi_{\parallel}^{-1}= \chi_{\perp}^{-1}\approx 3k_{B}T/M(T)+\mu_{0}H_{eff}(T)$. $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $M=M_{s}v$ is the magnetic moment of a single-domain nanostructure (macrospin approximation) where $M_{s}$ is its magnetization and $v$ its volume. The in-plane magnetic field is applied along $[110]$ or $[-110]$ crystal axes. Since the nanostructures Curie temperature does not exceed 170 K, the temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization is also accounted for by writting $M(T)$. Antiferromagnetic interactions between nanostructures are also considered by adding an effective field estimated in the mean field approximation \cite{Fruc02}: $\mu_{0}H_{eff}(T)$.
The only fitting parameters are the maximum magnetic moment (\textit{i.e.} at low temperature) per nanostructure: $M$ (in Bohr magnetons $\mu_{B}$) and the maximum interaction field (\textit{i.e.} at low temperature): $\mu_{0}H_{eff}$.

\label{fig11}
\end{figure}

In Fig. 11, the best fits lead to $M\approx$1250 $\mu_{B}$ and $\mu_{0}H_{eff}\approx$102 mT for in-plane susceptibility and $M\approx$1600 $\mu_{B}$ and $\mu_{0}H_{eff}\approx$98 mT for out-of-plane susceptibility. It gives an average magnetic moment of 1425 $\mu_{B}$ per column and an effective interaction field of 100 mT. Using this magnetic moment and its temperature dependence, magnetization curves could be fitted using a Langevin function and $M(H/T)$ curves superimpose for $T<$100 K. However, from the saturated magnetic moment of the columns and their density (35000 $\rm{\mu m}^{-2}$), we find almost 6000 $\mu_{B}$ per column. Therefore, for low growth temperatures, we need to assume that nanocolumns are actually made of almost four independent elongated magnetic nanostructures. The effective field for antiferromagnetic interactions between nanostructures estimated from the susceptibility fits is at least one order of magnitude larger than what is expected from pure magnetostatic coupling. This difference may be due to either an additional antiferromagnetic coupling through the matrix which origin remains unexplained or to the mean field approximation which is no more valid in this strong coupling regime. As for magnetic anisotropy, the nanostructures behave as isotropic magnetic systems or exhibit a cubic magnetic anisotropy. First we can confirm that nanostructures are not amorphous otherwise shape anisotropy would dominate leading to out-of-plane anisotropy. We can also rule out a random distribution of magnetic easy axes since the nanostructures are clearly crystallized in the diamond structure and would exhibit at least a cubic anisotropy (except if the random distribution of Mn atoms within the nanostructures can yield random easy axes). Since the nanostructures are in strong in-plane compression (their lattice parameter is larger than the matrix one), the cubic symmetry of the diamond structure is broken and magnetic cubic anisotropy is thus unlikely. We rather believe that out-of-plane shape anisotropy is nearly compensated by in-plane magnetoelastic anisotropy due to compression leading to a \textit{pseudo} cubic anisotropy. From the blocking temperature (15 K) and the magnetic volume of the nanostructures , we can derive their magnetic anisotropy constant using $Kv=25k_{B}T_{B}$: K$\approx$10 kJ.m$^{-3}$ which is of the same order of magnitude as shape anisotropy.

For growth temperatures $T_{g}\geq$120$^{\circ}$C and Mn concentrations $\geq$ 7 \%, samples exhibit a magnetic signal above 200 K corresponding to Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters (see Fig. 7a). As we can see, SQUID measurements are much more sensitive to the presence of Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters, even at low concentration, than TEM and x-ray diffraction used in section \ref{structural}. We also observe a sharp transition in the ZFC curve (see Fig. 7b, Fig. 12a and 12b): the peak becomes very large and is shifted towards high blocking temperatures (the signal is maximum at $T=$23 K). This can be easily understood as a magnetic percolation of the four independent nanostructures obtained at low growth temperatures into a single magnetic nanocolumn. Therefore the magnetic volume increases sharply as well as blocking temperatures. At the same time, the size distribution widens as observed in TEM. In Fig. 12a, we have performed ZFC-FC measurements at different $T_{0}$ temperatures. The ZFC-FC irreversibility is observed up to the Curie temperature of $\approx$120 K meaning that a fraction of nanocolumns is ferromagnetic (\textit{i.e.} $T_{B}\geq T_{C}$).
In Fig. 12b, in-plane and out-of-plane ZFC curves nearly superimpose for $T\leq$150 K due to the isotropic magnetic behavior of the nanocolumns: in-plane magnetoelastic anisotropy is still compensating out-of-plane shape anisotropy. Moreover the magnetic signal above 150 K corresponding to Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters that start to form in this growth temperature range is strongly anisotropic. This perpendicular anisotropy confirms the epitaxial relation: (0002) Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ $\parallel$ (002) Ge discussed in Ref.\cite{Bihl06}. The magnetic easy axis of the clusters lies along the hexagonal $c$-axis which is perpendicular to the film plane.

For growth temperatures $T_{g}\geq$145$^{\circ}$C the cluster magnetic signal dominates (Fig. 13b). Superparamagnetic nanostructures are investigated performing ZFC-FC measurements at different $T_{0}$ temperatures (Fig. 13a). The first ZFC peak at low temperature \textit{i.e.} $\leq$ 150 K is attributed to  low-$T_{C}$ nanocolumns ($T_{C}\approx$130 K). This peak is wider than for lower growth temperatures and its maximum is further shifted up to 30 K. These results are in agreement with TEM observations: increasing $T_{g}$ leads to larger nanocolumns (\textit{i.e.} higher blocking temperatures) and wider size distributions. ZFC-FC irreversibility is observed up to the Curie temperature due to the presence of ferromagnetic columns. The second peak above 180 K in the ZFC curve is attributed to Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters and the corresponding ZFC-FC irreversibility persisting up to 300 K means that some clusters are ferromagnetic. We clearly evidence the out-of-plane anisotropy of Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters and the isotropic magnetic behavior of nanocolumns (Fig. 13b). In this growth temperature range, we have also investigated the Mn concentration dependence of magnetic properties.

\label{fig14}
\end{figure}

In Fig. 14a, for low Mn concentrations (2.3 \% and 4 \%) the contribution from diluted Mn atoms in the germanium matrix to the saturation magnetization is very high and nearly vanishes for higher Mn concentrations (7 \%, 9 \% and 13 \%) as observed for low growth temperatures. Above 7 \%, the magnetic signal mainly comes from nanocolumns and Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters. We can derive more information from ZFC-FC measurements (Fig. 14b). Indeed, for 2.3 \% of Mn, ZFC and FC curves nearly superimpose down to low temperature meaning that nanocolumns are superparamagnetic in the whole temperature range. Moreover the weak irreversibility arising at 300 K  means that some Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters have already formed in the samples even at very low Mn concentrations. For 4 \% of Mn, we can observe a peak with a maximum at the blocking temperature (12 K) in the ZFC curve. We can also derive the Curie temperature of nanocolumns: $\approx$45 K. The irresversibility arising at 300 K still comes from Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters. Increasing the Mn concentration above 7 \% leads to: higher blocking temperatures (20 K and 30 K) due to larger nanocolumns and wider ZFC peaks due to wider size distributions in agreement with TEM observations (see Fig. 3a). Curie temperatures also increase (110 K and 130 K) as well as the contribution from Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters.\\
Finally when increasing $T_{g}$ above 160$^{\circ}$C, the nanocolumns magnetic signal vanishes and only Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters and diluted Mn atoms coexist. The overall magnetic signal becomes comparable to the one measured on annealed samples in which only Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters are observed by TEM (see Fig. 7a).\\
The magnetic properties of high-$T_{C}$ nanocolumns obtained for $T_{g}$ close to 130$^{\circ}$C are discussed in detail in Ref.\cite{Jame06}.\\
In conclusion, at low growth temperatures ($T_{g}\leq$120$^{\circ}$C), nanocolumns are made of almost 4 independent elongated magnetic nanostructures. For $T_{g}\geq$120$^{\circ}$C, these independent nanostructures percolate into a single nanocolumn sharply leading to higher blocking temperatures. Increasing $T_{g}$ leads to larger columns with a wider size distribution as evidenced by ZFC-FC measurements and given by TEM observations. In parallel, some Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters start to form and their contribution increases when increasing $T_{g}$. Results on magnetic anisotropy seems counter-intuitive. Indeed Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ clusters exhibit strong out-of-plane anisotropy whereas nanocolumns which are highly elongated magnetic structures are almost isotropic. This effect is probably due to compensating in-plane magnetoelastic coupling (due to the columns compression) and out-of-plane shape anisotropy. 

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have investigated the structural and magnetic properties of thin Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films grown by low temperature molecular beam epitaxy. A wide range of growth temperatures and Mn concentrations have been explored. All the samples contain Mn-rich nanocolumns as a consequence of 2D-spinodal decomposition. However their size, crystalline structure and magnetic properties depend on growth temperature and Mn concentration. For low growth temperatures, nanocolumns are very small (their diameter ranges between 1.8 nm for 1.3 \% of Mn and 2.8 nm for 11.3 \% of Mn), their Curie temperature is rather low ($<$ 170 K) and they behave as almost four uncorrelated superparamagnetic nanostructures. Increasing Mn concentration leads to higher columns densities while diameters remain nearly unchanged. For higher growth temperatures, the nanocolumns mean diameter increases and their size distribution widens. Moreover the 4 independent magnetic nanostructures percolate into a single magnetic nanocolumn. Some columns are ferromagnetic even if Curie temperatures remain quite low. In this regime, increasing Mn concentration leads to larger columns while their density remains nearly the same. In parallel, Ge$_{3}$Mn$_{5}$ nanoclusters start to form in the film with their $c$-axis perpendicular to the film plane. In both temperature regimes, the Mn incorporation mechanism in the nanocolumns and/or in the matrix changes above 5 \% of Mn and nanocolumns exhibit an isotropic magnetic behaviour due to the competing effects of out-of-plane shape anisotropy and in-plane magnetoelastic coupling. Finally for a narrow range of growth temperatures around 130$^{\circ}$C, nanocolumns exhibit Curie temperatures higher than 400 K. Our goal is now to investigate the crystalline structure inside the nanocolumns, in particular the position of Mn atoms in the distorted diamond structure, which is essential to understand magnetic and future transport properties in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films.

Growing a magnetic and semiconducting material could lead to promising advances. The precise control of inhomogeneities appears as a new challenge. The increasing interest in group-IV magnetic semiconductor can also be explained by their potential compatibility with the existing silicon technology. In the present paper, we investigate the structural and magnetic properties of Ge$1-x$Mn$_x$ thin films for low growth temperatures ($1-1,000 K) and high temperatures ($200-400 K) Mn-rich nanocolumns have been evidenced in Ge$ 1-x-$1,200 K thin films which could be used to make room temperature operational devices. We also discuss the potential use of nanodevices such as memory nanodots, or nanochannels for spin injection in the future. The paper is published in the online edition of the journal Advanced Semiconductors, published by the American Institute of Semiconductor Engineers (AISSE). For more information, visit the AISSE website or go to: www.aisse.org/news/news-releases/2014/08/09/article-news-release-story.html. Growth was performed using solid sources molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) by co-depositing Ge and Mn evaporated from standard Knudsen effusion cells. Germanium substrates were epi-ready Ge(001) wafers with a residual n-type doping. Mn concentrations range from 1 \% to 11\% Mn. We discuss the structural and magnetic properties of these nanostructures as a function of manganese concentration and growth temperature. We also discuss the magnetic anisotropy of nanocolumns and Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ clusters at the surface of the film of the germanium matrix. The nature of these crystallites will be discussed below. The presence of the spots reveal the presence of additional additional additional clusters of Ge$3$N$N4$N5$ cluster in the Ge$5$N6$N7$N8$N9$N10$N11$N12$N13$N14$N15$N16$N17$N18$N19$N20$N21$N22$N23$N24$N25$N26$N28$N29$N32$N33$N34$N35$N36$N37$N38$N39$N40$N41$N42$N43$N44$N45$N46$N47$N48$N49$N54$N55$N56$N57$N58$N59$N61$N62$N63$N64$N65$N68$N69$N74$N75$N79 Nanocolumns are Mn rich and the surrounding matrix is Mn poor. Their structural properties have been investigated by plane view TEM observations. In Fig. 2d we show a cross sectional Mn chemical map of the Ge$1-x$Mn$_{x}$ film. This map shows that the formation of nanocolumnS is a consequence of Mn segregation. For samples grown below 5% Mn we can conclude that the Mn content in the nanocolumins is between 30% and 38%. For samples growing between 80$^\circ$C and 150$^’circ $C, we reveal the presence of Mn rich nanocolums surrounded with a Mn poor Ge matrix. We conclude that Mn concentration measured by EELS is between 0\% and 1\%, and that the structural properties of these films are related to the concentration of Mn in the film. We show the evolution of the density as a function of the size and size dependence of the concentration (b) of the columns. The mean diameter is 1.8 fpm and the mean density is 1 fpm fpm on a scale of 1 to 2.5 fpm. We also show that the density is 13,000 $mu m-2$ with a mean diameter of 3 nm. Increasing the Mn content in the samples from 1.3 to 11.3 \% leads to a decrease of the columns density. The crystalline structure of nanocolumns is also highly modified. In plane view TEM micrographs, one can see columns exhibiting several different crystalline structures. We have evidenced a complex mechanism of Mn incorporation in Mn doped Ge films grown at low temperature. In particular, Mn incorporation is highly inhomogeneous. For very low growth temperatures (below 120$^\circ$C) the diffusion of Mn atoms leads to the formation of Mn rich, vertical nanocolumins. Their density mostly depends on Mn concentration and their mean diameter is about 2 nm. One can see dislocations at the interface between the columns and the matrix leading to stress relaxation. These columns are typical in samples grown at 150$^{\circ}$C with high Mn contents. We conclude that coherent columns are probably in strong compression and the surrounding matrix in tension. These results can be compared with the theoretical predictions of Fukushima (Fukushima 2006) based on a model of spinodal decomposition in (Ga,Mn)N and (Zn,Cr)Te) Based on layer by layer growth conditions and a strong pair of attraction between Mn atoms, this model may also describe the formation in our samples. For all samples, all the observations indicate two-dimensional growth. Three samples grown at different temperatures and/or annealed at high temperature were investigated. By analysing x-ray diffraction spectra, we can evidence two different crystalline structures. A typical high resolution TEM image is shown in figure 6. We observe the coexistence of two Mn-rich phases: Ge$3 and Ge$5 nanoclusters embedded in the germanium matrix. The $c$ lattice parameter of Ge$_3$_5$ hexagonal crystal is 5.053 \AA. This is in very good agreement with the values obtained from diffraction data for both (002) and (004) lines. The two-dimensional spinodal decomposition of the films is probably the consequence of the high concentrations of Mn. We have shown that this decomposition takes place in very thin Ge$_{1-x}$Mn $ films. We also show that the decomposition occurs in a wide range of temperatures and concentrations, in spite of a high dynamics of the order of 10$^7$. We conclude that this is an example of a ‘non-trivial’ form of nanomaterials that could be used to make a new type of ‘nanomaterial’. EM observations and x-ray diffraction, we have shown that Ge$_3$Mn$_5$ nanoclusters start to form at growth temperatures higher than 160$^\circ$C. The relative weight of each phase clearly depends on the growth temperature and to a lesser extend on Mn concentration. For low growth temperature, we show that nanocolumns are actually made of four uncorrelated superparamagnetic nanostructures. This peak widens and shifts towards high blocking temperatures when increasing growth temperature. The increasing ZFC-FC irreversibility at $\approx$ 300 K is due to the increasing contribution from large ferromagnetic Ge$_{3}$MN$5}$ clusters. After annealing, the magnetic signal mostly arises from Ge$1-x-Mn $5-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20-21-22-23-24-25-26-28-27-29-30-28,28-29,28,29,30,31,32,32-32,33,34,34-34,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,68,69,70,72,73,74,75,78,79,80,82,83,84,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,94 ion is displayed in figure 8. For the lowest Mn concentration (4 \%), the contribution from diluted Mn atoms is very high. This behavior may be related to different Mn compositions. In samples containing 4 \% of Mn, ZFC and FC curves superimpose down to low temperatures. As we do not observe hysteresis loops at low temperature, we believe that at this Mn concentration nanocolumns are  superparamagnetic in the whole temperature range. For higher Mn contents, the ZFC curve exhibits a very narrow peak with a maximum at the blocking temperature of 15 K whatever the Mn concentration and growth temperature. If magnetic anisotropy does not depend on the particle size, this distribution exactly reflects their magnetic size distribution. At a given temperature $T_{0}$ such that 25$k_{B}T_0} falls into the anisosotropy barrier distribution, the largest nanostructures with an anisomagnetism energy larger than 25 $k$B$T-0 are blocked whereas the others are super paramagnetic. The results are given in Fig. 10a and 10a.5. We have performed ZFC-FC measurements but instead of warming the sample up to 400 K, we stopped at a lower temperature of $T{0}$. In order to derive the magnetic size and anisotropy of the Mn-rich nanocolumns embedded in the Ge matrix, we have fitted the inverse normalized in-plane (resp. out-of-plane) susceptibility. The corresponding experimental ZFC-FC curves are reported in Fig. 10b. Since susceptibility measurements are performed at low field (0.015 T), the matrix magnetic signal remains negligible. The effective field for antiferromagnetic interactions between nanostructures is estimated to be at least one order of magnitude larger than what is expected from pure magnetatic coupling. This may be due to an additional coupling through the matrix which remains unexplained to the mean field approximation which is no more valid in this regime. Therefore, we need to assume that nanocolumins are actually made of almost four independent elongated magneticisotries. As an alternative, we can use the following expression well suited for isotropic systems or cubic an isotropy: $M(H)$. This gives an average magnetic moment of 1425 $K(B)$ per column and an effective interaction field of 100 mT. In Fig. 11, the best fits lead to $M\approx$1250 $K (B) and $M ($B) per column. rule out a random distribution of magnetic easy axes since the nanostructures are clearly crystallized in the diamond structure. We rather believe that out-of-plane shape anisotropy is nearly compensated by in-plane magnetoelastic an isotropy due to compression. Magnetization was recorded up to different T$_{0}$ temperatures: 50 K, 100 K, 150 K, 200 K and 250 K. The ZFC-FC irreversibility is observed up to the Curie temperature of $\approx$120 K meaning that a fraction of nanocolumns is ferromagnetic (\textit{i.e. $T_{B}\geq T_{C}$). In Fig. 12b, in-planes and out-planes ZFC curves nearly superimpose for $T\leq$150 K due to the isotropic magnetic behavior of the nanocolumins. We also observe a sharp transition in the ZFC curve (see Fig. 7b, F. 12a and 12b): the peak becomes very large and is shifted towards high blocking temperatures (the signal is maximum at $T=$23 K). This can be easily understood as a magnetic percolation of the four independent nanostructureures obtained at low growth temperatures into a single magnetic nanocolum. eratures (Fig. 13a). The first ZFC peak at low temperature is attributed to nanocolumns. ZFC-FC irreversibility is observed up to the Curie temperature due to the presence of ferromagnetic columns. In this growth temperature range, we have also investigated the Mn concentration dependence of magnetic properties. The overall magnetic signal becomes comparable to the one measured by TEM (see Fig. 7a). We clearly evidence the out-of-plane anisotropy of Ge$1-x$Mn$_{x}$ films grown at 150$^{\circ}$C. The in-plane applied field is 0.025 T for 2.3% and 4% of Mn, and 0.015 T for 8% and 11.3%. We can also derive the curie temperature: $T_{C}\approx$45 K. For 4% Mn, we can observe a peak with a maximum at the blocking temperature (12 K) in the ZFC curve. The irresversibility arising at 300 K still comes from Ge$_{3}$MN$_{5}$ clusters. Increasing the Mn. concentration above 7 \% leads to: higher blocking temperatures (20 K and 30 K) due to larger nanocol Autumns and wider ZFC peaks due to wider size distributions. Nanocolumns are very small and behave as almost four uncorrelated superparamagnetic nanostructures. Increasing Mn concentration leads to higher columns densities while diameters remain nearly unchanged. Some columns are ferromagnetic even if Curie temperatures remain quite low. Our goal is now to investigate the crystalline structure inside the nanocolumnS, in particular the position of Mn atoms in the distorted diamond structure, which is essential to understand magnetic and future transport properties in Ge$1-x$Mn$_{x}$ films.

1- Imagine you have two individuals. One truly believes in God but he is a bad husband and father who cheats on his wife and neglects his children. The other man is a nonbeliever; he accepts religion in theory and doctrine but simply does not have faith no matter how hard he tried. He is a good father and a good husband as well. When they stand before God at the Day of Judgment, would the nonbeliever be condemned to eternal hell only for that one flaw in him? Don't the other good traits in that person matter at all? Does being a nonbeliever equal being evil?
2-God knows everything. However, why would He have created when He knows exactly what each person is going to do and where they will end up? For example, let us suppose that tomorrow I will murder someone. God knows that I will do that. And He knows that I will suffer in hell when the time comes. So why does He purposely inflict that pain on me? To teach me a lesson? He knows the outcome of everything and everyone He has created.
3-Since you brought up science in the previous comments section, I am seriously curious (I am not trying to be glib) about dinosaurs and prehistoric humans. We have seen the evolution of humans and we have fossils and hard evidence of it. The science world has traced back ""Eve"" to Africa. The concept of Adam and Eve seems too mythological to be 100% factual. It has the same tone of Greek and Ancient Egyptian legends.

You'll be answerd personaly only if; you comment with your blogger's name/nick.
I answered you before & there was no response from your behalf. Why would you think you're worth an answer from me since you can seek answers from good books?
Your questions are very simple, with clean cut answers. Don't use the word corner; it indicates things you don't have the first alphabet for!
Religion was established to calm our fears from the unknown. Freud did write about it in the father figure argument. Try to read it.
I deleted my last comment because in the end of it I inserted some thing that may offend some people (if you read it, I gauss you know what I mean). Abraham did not believe in God until he saw the birds come to life. So, all what I want is a single prove similar to Abraham.
I indeed busy doing my homework; I have to solve the energy equation and the continuity equation to come with another, hopefully, exact solution to the problem.
Do you work? I mean do you have a job, it seems that you are always on line!!!???? It is amazing how some one would stick to the internet. Try to go out more often, play sport or find any other hobby. If you could not disattach yourself from the internet try and seek a professional help… :-). Honestly, I’m not making fun of you it is just an advice… sincere advice.
I measure prosperity of a nation by the degree of its civilization in comparison to others of its time. Islamic civilization was at the peak during the Umayyad and Abbasid reigns, at the time when Moslems conquered other nations and dying civilizations, and mixed with them, and the new comers in Islam started researching for the truth. In their quest they translated Greek philosophy books and dug into ancient ones. Their search for truth led them to the emergence of chemistry, Algebra and other sciences And their findings excelled them in innovative inventions. The maps and astrolabes that Columbus used to sail on his quest to discover the West years later were taken from the Arabs. And in contrary to the scribbles of their holy book, Arabic books were the first that brought the roundedness of earth to world attention. Arabic language romanticized the rigid Latin, poetry and verse advanced. At one time, civilization was dubbed as Arabization in Andalusia and that was evident in Andalusia’s Christian and Jewish ancient books. Islamic Architecture and their aggregation systems portrayed marvels of their time. Islamic libraries were huge and rich for the European knowledge seekers.
And history tells us that those were the times when Moslems were the furthest from the dogma of their religion, there societies were open to controlled prostitution in the name of dancimng Jawari, and alcohol was openly consumed. We also notice in these periods that struggle for power among them mounted, yet they were the most tolerant to other nations and beliefs. There was nothing Islamic about them at that time, only a name. After that time, the Islamic civilization collapsed and kept deteriorating as people clung more to the their religious beliefs that were diverted through different interpretations.
And based on that; I believe that it’s not only Moslems who missread their religion, the problem stemmed from the core of the religion (Quran and tradition) for being vague and subject to different interpretations. If Quran was the true word of God, then it should have contained the miracle of not being subject to different interpretations, at least to keep Moslems united, and then, one would believe that Islam is suitable for every location and time.
Nothing can give a solid proof of the existence of heaven and hell, yet, nothing can disprove it either. Same goes to God. So the chance remain fifty-fifty. You either believe in it for the sake of taking a lesser risk if you don’t believe in blind faith, or discard it all together. Yet, the possibility is there until proved or disproved. As for now; these cases can only be understood through logic. So let’s reiterate your question and narrow it down to make it closer to something that can be measured.
Is there any mention of the stories of prophets outside the holy books? Are there any archeological evidences of each prophet’s reign (and I stress prophet’s)? Are there any mention of each prophet in history books outside its holy book, or the books that were based on it’s holy books? Ok, that was too general, let’s narrow it down a bit since your knowledge of your religion, mashallah, especially in reciting Quran is superb.
Is there any mention of the prophet Mohammad reign in non-Moslem history books other than those referenced to Moslem books? And if there were; did those stories mach? Did archeology of Mohammad’s time match those stories? Did ancient books of other nations confirm those stories? After all Mecca was an open, mid trade center for traders of the South and the North, and supposedly was exposed and open to other nations, and an emergence of a new religion would not have gone unnoticed in the ancient books of those nations.
That's why faith is called ""FAITH"" to believe in the unseen, you see.
keep in mind that every major religion has gone through various phases from emergence to growth to stagnation to depression and reformation. these are cycles that play out across centuries and i suspect islam is not immune to them.
islam is unique in that it is truly the last 'great' religion and it is here to stay. the future should be one of consilience and consolidation between religions and peoples.
at the end of the day - tolerance of thought will be the salvation of mankind.
I've been asking your first question for as long as I can remember and nobody has given me a convincing answer yet. I also asked the second question verbatim when I was in my high school's Tarbiya Islamiya class, and the teacher had no answer. I kept hounding him until the students yelled at me to shut up and then he kicked me out!
We're all adults here, so why can't you answer Anon's query? I still find it amazing that you named yourself after Saint Joan. A Christian (gasp!) who will burn in hell according to some of the comments here.
All men are my brothers. I would have liked to have said it then, and I would like to say it now: all men are my brothers. But all men are not my brothers. Why? Because all women are my sisters. And the brother who denies the rights of his sister: that brother is not my brother. At the very best, he is my half-brother - by definition. Osama is not my brother.
Religion is sensitive ground, as well it might be. Here we walk on eggshells. Because religion is itself an eggshell. Today, in the West, there are no good excuses for religious belief - unless we think that ignorance, reaction and sentimentality are good excuses. This is of course not so in the East, where, we acknowledge, almost every living citizen in many huge and populous countries is intimately defined by religious belief. The excuses, here, are very persuasive; and we duly accept that 'faith' - recently and almost endearingly defined as 'the desire for the approval of supernatural beings' - is a world-historical force and a world-historical actor. All religions, unsurprisingly, have their terrorists, Christian, Jewish, Hindu, even Buddhist. But we are not hearing from those religions. We are hearing from Islam.
Let us make the position clear. We can begin by saying, not only that we respect Muhammad, but that no serious person could fail to respect Muhammad - a unique and luminous historical being. Judged by the continuities he was able to set in motion, he remains a titanic figure, and, for Muslims, all-answering: a revolutionary, a warrior, and a sovereign, a Christ and a Caesar, 'with a Koran in one hand', as Bagehot imagined him, 'and a sword in the other'. Muhammad has strong claims to being the most extraordinary man who ever lived. And always a man, as he always maintained, and not a god. Naturally we respect Muhammad. But we do not respect Muhammad Atta.
Until recently it was being said that what we are confronted with, here, is 'a civil war' within Islam. That's what all this was supposed to be: not a clash of civilisations or anything like that, but a civil war within Islam. Well, the civil war appears to be over. And Islamism won it. The loser, moderate Islam, is always deceptively well-represented on the level of the op-ed page and the public debate; elsewhere, it is supine and inaudible. We are not hearing from moderate Islam. Whereas Islamism, as a mover and shaper of world events, is pretty well all there is.
So, to repeat, we respect Islam - the donor of countless benefits to mankind, and the possessor of a thrilling history. But Islamism? No, we can hardly be asked to respect a creedal wave that calls for our own elimination. More, we regard the Great Leap Backwards as a tragic development in Islam's story, and now in ours. Naturally we respect Islam. But we do not respect Islamism, just as we respect Muhammad and do not respect Muhammad Atta.

When will BC leave Boston?,"Eagle in Atlanta -- atleagle.com: July 2012
Why Spaz's recruiting doesn't matter anymore
After BC picked up another below the radar recruit, Spaz's most vocal critics were out again disparaging his recruiting class. I don't trust the recruiting rankings, but it does concern me that our commitments aren't drawing more interest from BCS teams. There is a similar concern on the Penn State front. There's plenty of speculation, but BC is not a factor among the rumored PSU transfers. But really none of it matters. Spaz is going to wrap up most of the recruiting this summer and then focus on the games come fall. While not inspiring, the plan is practical. There are two outcomes:
1. Spaz has a losing season and gets fired. If this happens, our 2013 recruiting class will be a hodgepodge of current commits, a transfer or two and whatever our new coach can uncover. For a new guy Spaz's lower profile recruits might be an advantage. If they aren't valued, they are less likely to be poached by other programs. A new Head Coach can then exert a little effort in getting the Spaz commits to stay committed and spend more time on filling out the class.
2. Spaz has a winning season and keeps his job. In this scenario Spaz stays off the hot seat and has to finish filling out the 2013 recruiting class. With a little more job security he can use his last few scholarships on bigger names. He may even luck into a decent prospect who suddenly becomes available due to another school's coaching change (like he did with Rutgers last year). In this case Spaz doesn't waste time recruiting during the season and then picks up some low-hanging fruit.
Spaz is never going to recruit an elite class. There are many contributing factors as to why, but mostly it is because Spaz is not a salesmen. And we shouldn't care. He's not going to change. It is just a matter of who will finish out this class four months from now.

Key Players for 2012: Chase Rettig
Junior Quarterback, Chase Rettig
What he's been: We all hoped Rettig would be a phenom. That he would some how save the Spaz era from its offensive funk and lead BC to unexpected glory. Instead, he's been mediocre. He completed just over half of his passes last year and never put together back-to-back great games nor enough sustained drives. Apologists for Rettig like me blame the system, the talent around him and of course the way his Spaz has screwed up the offense. But even the biggest Rettig cheerleaders have to admit he's yet to have a memorable BC moment or done anything to get on an NFL radar.
What he needs to be: Someone who can put the team on his back. I know the offensive line has been terrible, leaving Chase running for his life. I know plenty of passes have been dropped and no one is making big plays. But a truly great QB would show more by now. He's started 21 games. He's finally is a simplified offense that will get the ball out of his hands. If Chase does have an accurate arm, if he is as cerebral as people say, if he can get off throws in a collapsing pocket, now is his chance to show it.
Why I like his chances to shine: I don't know if Doug Martin is going to be a miracle worker, but QB's can make huge leaps with a new offense. Just look at Dominique Davis. He went to East Carolina and became one of the most accurate passers in the country.
Last year I thought Rettig would be great. I thought his toughness and preparation would overcome the offensive limitations. Here I am a year late thinking the same thing. But the difference is Doug Martin. We finally have an experienced OC running a current, simple offense. Rettig will be asked to make quick decisions and get the ball out fast. I think he can do it. I also think that throwing 400+ passes will give him a rhythm and a confidence that he's never had at BC.

Rich Thompson will cover BC football this Fall for the Herald
There is some news on the BC media front. The Herald assigned Rich Thompson to the BC beat for this Fall's football season. Rich has covered BC on occasion over the years, but mostly on the basketball side. Thompson is a welcome addition, as the Herald's focus has been spotty since Steve Conroy started splitting his time on hockey. Hopefully a new voice on the BC scene will also spark Blauds to improve his work.
For many years, BC fans' main source of news was Mike (Vega at the Globe) and Mike (Shalin at the Herald). We complained about their identical features and soft touch on the BC coaches. Little did we know how good things were. Since Vega's move in 2007, we've been left with a beat writer who seems to loathe his job and also makes excuses for our Head Coach. Blauds also rarely writes or tweets during the college offseason. That sort of editorial decision may have been fine 20 years ago, but now college sports is a year round news cycle. When you look at all the work produced by college beat writers around the country, it makes the Boston media look lazy or oblivious.
Thompson also plans to tweet regularly once the season starts. I hope he makes the most of this opportunity. It is a shame to see the beat neglected like it is across town.

Revisiting a Boston (BC) Olympics using London as an example
During the 2010 Winter Olympics I tossed around the idea of Boston hosting a summer or winter games. My point then remains that the same: Boston is ideal because the local universities could already supply many of the venues. The big obstacle would always be the main stadium for Track & Field and the opening and closing ceremonies. Nearly every city that hosts is left with a White Elephant that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. But London may provide a solution. They built their Olympic Stadium as a temporary venue. It looked great on TV, holds enough for the games and can be shrunk as soon as it all wraps up. Londoners haven't decided what they will do with the space. There are a few different bidders looking to take over the remains of the stadium. Boston would probably have similar suitors depending on the location. I would guess that UMasss Boston would want a small stadium or maybe the Revolution would want to convert it to a soccer only facility. The possibilities are endless.
I would still love to see Boston host the games and wish our partner Fenway Sports Group would get behind it. I am practical too. This wouldn't just be a vanity project for BC. It would be a backdoor way to get the IOC to fix the air conditioning in Conte!

New soccer Eagles and other links
BCeagles.com released the bios of the six new freshmen and two transfers for the men's soccer team. Four of the newbies hail from New York.
It feels like every ACC team returns a starting QB. While the depth gives the conference advantages that other conferences don't have, I think some of the talent is overrated. In fact, I can't believe that Rettig is considered the 10th best. I would rank him 5th and think he could be even better by the end of the year.
Despite shoulder surgery, Alex Albright is healthy heading into his second NFL season. He's also ready to move to inside linebacker.
In case you missed it, BC will play Baylor in the Charleston Classic this Fall. That gives all the Boston media, the college basketball writers and the BC bloggers a chance to rehash the Donahue-Heslip situation again.

Can BC sell a faceless program?
As the team prepared for the poster photo shoot, I started to think about some of the current challenges BC faces marketing the program. Who will be the focus of the poster? Can a casual BC fan name our best players? With the team coming off its worst season in over a decade, it would be nice to have a focal point. A person who fans could rally around. With Kuechly gone, BC doesn't have that player or coach.
Spaz is not a compelling public speaker. BC uses coordinators in their Youtube videos. No BC player made the ACC's preseason all conference team. They have two likeable but rather unknown Seniors on the cover of the media guide.
Perception matters in college football. Obviously tickets sales are part of that, but lacking a star player hurts when TV networks are selecting our games. Even if some of our players have breakout years, they will have a hard time winning national awards.
BC created some new and unique ticket packages to help attendance for the less attractive games. If we are play well, TV networks might pay attention during the last month of the season. But if the team struggles, it will be hard to sell anything. You can't force players to be great or be dynamic personalities. Even if players aren't well known, I am consistently proud of how they handle themselves. But BC can ask its coach to sell the program. Spaz doesn't and won't. But I hope that when we hire a new coach that sales and marketing aspect are not ignored. Coaching is primary, but representing BC should always be a factor.

Phil Steele talks ACC and other links
Here is Phil Steele previewing the Big East and the ACC.
Former Eagle Tim Bulman signed with New England.His teammate Ricky Brown is hanging on too and is now with the Ravens.
Did anyone else hear this comment from Spaz?
""We've tied Chase's hands behind his back his first two years. He's at the point now where he's ready to cross the line.""
I know this sort of thing is off the cuff, but why is he saying that he's held a QB back? Am I the only one who gets frustrated by this stuff?
VCU hired BC grad Ed McLaughlin as their new AD. If and when Gene retires McLaughlin will be one of top targets to replace him.
This is from earlier in the week, but I am glad Kimble is confident. I think he could have a big season.
Emmett Cleary provides some insights into how the offense will change.

Viva Espana: what you need to know about the basketball team's trip to Spain
NCAA rules allow a basketball team to take an overseas summer tour once every four years. These trips are a huge advantage as they allow the team to play together and at a high level during a dead period. In addition to improving skills, the trips also bond teams together and help the coaches experiment with different rotations and lineups. In the past BC has traveled to France, Switzerland and Australia. In a little less than a month, BC will take its first trip to Spain. This is our first tour under Donahue and a critical chance for this team to get better. Below are some of the facts, figures, schedules and nuggets about the trip.
All players can and will attend, including new freshmen Joe Rahon, Olivier Hanlan and incoming Senior Andrew Van Nest. Transfer Alex Dragicevich cannot go.
Aside from the players, the rest of the travel party includes the coaching staff, a trainer, a sports information director, and two managers.
Some of the schedule is still being finalized, but here are BC's current plans for games:
August 27 Madrid - Game 1
August 29 Valencia – Game 2 (ACB Team - Valencia Basket)
August 31 Barcelona - Game 3 (ACB Team - Penya or Manresa)
September 1 Barcelona - Game 4 (LEB Team)
The team leaves Boston on August 25. In each city they will practice and see some of the local sights. They also have community service time scheduled. The team returns on September 3. Classes begin back in Boston the next day.
The games will be played with international rules, courts and FIBA balls.
BC doesn't know if the referees will speak any English (but they're hoping).
For any Eagle fans in Spain, try to catch a game or two. It should be fun. For those of us stateside, there are presently no official broadcasts but I imagine an internet feed will pop up for some of the action.

Key Players for 2012: Dominic Appiah
Sophomore Defensive Tackle, Dominic Appiah
What he's been: Appiah surprised many last year. Playing for the first time after redshirting his freshman year, Appiah ended up starting most of the games. He made his presence known quickly with the ability to get an inside push and make plays in the backfield. Appiah was new to the inside but he showed natural ability and moved very well considering he played nearly 30 pounds lighter in high school.
What he needs to be: We need Appiah to be like B.J. Raji or Ron Brace. We don't have as many difference makers in other areas of the defense. If Appiah and Ramsey partner to become a dominant force -- like Brace and Raji -- it will create all sorts of opportunities for the rest of the defense. If the two of them can control the line of scrimmage we can become one of the elite DLines in the ACC.
Why I like his chances to shine: It feels like I am head of the Appiah fan club. Spaz doesn't even have him at the top of the preseason depth chart. Of all the guys I have profiled, he would probably be viewed as the least likely to make an impact. He's still young. He's still learning the position and he's still getting used to moving with his added bulk. But I saw enough moments that I believe Appiah can be a great DT. He has the push, the leverage and surprising speed for big guy. Other teams had trouble handling him last year. If Appiah remains focused and works hard, he is going to dominate every interior lineman in the conference. And if Ramsey and Appiah both play well, BC will be a bowl team again.

ACC Media roundup and other links
The ACC Media voted BC 5th overall in the Atlantic Division. That's not particularly surprising since the majority of the reporters are from Carolina and still view us as a secondary program. Although I teased him on twitter, even Meter avoided his usual ""BC: 1st"" vote.
The recurring question for Spaz was regarding Kuechly. He handles it well and points to Ramsey as the type of player who can fill the void. Not too many asked Spaz about the ""Hot Seat."" (I didn't embed that video due to the auto play issues.)
It will be interesting to see if BC benefits from the looming exodus at Penn State. We are positioned well since we have scholarship space and recruited many of their kids. But I wonder if Spaz will have any hesitation in taking advantage of his alma mater.
Virginia Athlete Atem Ntantang committed to BC.
The ACC Digital Network is running a countdown of great moments. Of course they included BC comeback against Virginia Tech. It doesn't have Chris Fowler yelling ""Lane Stadium goes silent"" but it does have Meter losing it.
BC is one of the schools to leverage the transfer up phenomenon in college football.

ACC Kickoff, Day 1 -- UPDATE
UPDATE: I took down the video since it was auto playing for people. You can listen to Ramsey and Cleary here.
I hoped that Spaz would address the Penn State situation. Knowing that those types of questions were coming, the ACC coaches released a joint statement on Penn State and Paterno. Someone should still ask Spaz on Monday since he does know Sandusky and played under Paterno.
This is a shot of Kaleb Ramsey talking to the media. And here is all the players together. Cleary also fielded questions, including those about biology and chemistry.
I expect more on Monday when Spaz talks. I also think all the newspaper guys (including Blauds) will write up their interviews from Sunday into Monday posts.

Questions I want asked at the ACC Media Days
The ACC convenes this weekend in Greensboro for the annual ACC Media Days. I am not going. But I do have questions I would ask.
Questions for Frank Spaziani
-- Is he aware of the ""hot seat"" talk? Does he feel the pressure. How does he get the team and staff to focus? Is it impacting recruiting?
-- What are his expectations for the season? Does he see the team competing for a division title?
-- What attracted him to Doug Martin's offense? What are his expectations for the offense? Does he think the increased tempo will impact the defensive side of the ball?
-- What will Bollman's role be as ""running game coordinator""? Is Bollman using different techniques and or approaches to the offensive line play?
-- What traits was he looking for as he hired new coaches to replace the departed?
-- As a Penn State alum and former player, what are his thoughts on the Freeh report? Are the former players talking among themselves about what they can do to help rebuild the Penn State football reputation? What does he want done with the Paterno statue?
-- When did the staff approach him about moving to the left side? How is he preparing for the new position?
--Who is leading the OL drills in the offseason?
-- How are things different with a new position coach? What will fans see?
-- What aspects of his game is he focusing on this year?
-- How is Chase Rettig adjusting to the new offense?
-- Which offensive player will surprise BC fans this year? Who is going to make a big leap?
-- What are his expectations for the season? How important is it to the Seniors to get back to a winning record and a bowl game?
-- How is his health?
-- What was it like to sit out a season?
-- Earlier in his career there was speculation that he might transfer from BC. How does it feel to be a 5th year senior at BC now?
-- Last year BC played more three man fronts than ever before. Will we see more of that this year?
-- Does the talk of an NFL career add any extra motivation?
We know Blauds and HD will be in Greensboro. Hopefully they or others will slip in one or two of these questions. I don't expect anything particularly revealing, but I would like to hear Spaz talk about the pressure of the season.

Willis commits, decommits and then commits, and other links
It was a strange night if you follow BC recruiting on Twitter. First Rivals reported Georgia running back Myles Willis' commitment. Then Willis himself took to twitter to say that he didn't commit. Later in the night he clarified that he did commit. Regardless, it seems like it is over and he seems like a good pickup. He plays for local Atlanta power Marist. I will try to check out one of his games this fall.
One of the great under-appreciated aspects of BC sports is ""For Boston."" However, the bloggers at Atlantic Coast Convos have great taste as they listed our fight song as the best in the ACC. (Am I the only one singing ""For Boston"" to himself right now?)
BCeagles.com put out another player Q&A, this time with basketball transfer Alex Dragicevich. Dennis Clifford is one of the players who has made an early impression on Alex.

Key Players for 2012: Ian White
Junior Center, Ian White
What he's been: The redshirt JR has played a lot and almost all of it at guard. What's been frustrating is that White would be very, very good in some games and then off in others. Because he is playing primarily inside, the issues usually involve getting overpowered by bigger DTs. Like most of the olinemen the past few years, White's flashed moments of greatness but lacked consistency.
What he needs to be: In my opinion the offensive line play really started falling apart after Matt Tennant left. I think Centers are underappreciated...at times even by their own coaches. It seems like the Spaz/Devine MO was to put the best five on the field regardless of positional fit and not to worry about rejiggering the lineup. The way the staff yo-yo'd Mark Spinney and others at Center the past two years hurt our consistency. And it impacts the QB position too. White's new to the role, so this could lead to more chaos. I hope not. We need him to be good from Day 1. He needs to set the tone for the OL and communicate with Rettig. Other players are important, but White -- or whoever starts at Center -- will be the keystone to the offense.
Why I like his chances to shine: Like Cleary, I think White is one of those guys who would have thrived under old BC regimes. He's been smart and tough from the minute he was eligible to play. He might not be as powerful as needed, but now as a redshirt JR, he should be fully matured. Plus playing Center doesn't require as much power and is more reliant on smarts and quickness.
I don't know if White will be our starting Center for Miami or even later into the season. Under Devine positions and the depth chart were constantly being tweaked. I pray things are different with Bollman. Let White learned to be a Center. He has a chance to be a great one.

How I talk myself into thinking we are going to be good...
You can see it on the BC message boards. You can see it on twitter and on the blogs. Optimism is rising. People are looking forward to the BC Football season. On Eagle Outsider they sarcastically call this ""10-2 season."" It is that time of year when every aspect of the team and season still has hope and promise. Despite my best judgement and spending half of my posts speculating on Spaz's future, I am falling into this same trap. The closer we get to kickoff and the more I read, the more I think BC might surprise people this year. I am not ready to post my predictions for the season, but here are a few reasons why I do think this team should be bowl bound.
It looks tougher on paper than it really is. Our toughest opponents come to us. We play three of our first four at home. Playing FSU and Georgia Tech on back-to-back weeks is a bit rough, but playing Georgia Tech any time forces a team to regroup. If you have to play a gimmick offense, you might as well do it after facing a top 10 team. Maybe it will serve as a rally point after playing the 'Noles.
Underrated talent
Look at that depth chart again. It is not an all star lineup, but I think our front seven will be better than last year. I love some of the young DBs (Keyes, Asprilla) and think with a healthy Noel and improved ALJ, we can be solid defensively. I still think Chase Rettig can be great. I have real hope for Doug Martin and think our WR and TE talent is good enough. The biggest question is the offensive line. But as someone who has preached for a OL coaching change, I keep telling myself that Bollman will make a difference.
Emotion and Pride
Football is an emotional game and emotional sport. Point fingers at whomever you like, but BC had awful team and coaching chemistry last season. When I see Al Washington posting on Facebook about his excitement, when I hear about the 5th year Seniors wanting to end their careers on a high note, when I look at the new field, I think that positive energy and emotion will carry us to an extra win or two.
As long as these two (see pic below) stay out of the way and Spaz coaches to win, I think this might be a fun season. Is anyone else talking themselves into a big year?
Labels: 2012, 2012 Preview, 2012 Schedule, Chase Rettig, Doug Martin, fire Spaz, Speculating with Spaz
Key Players for 2012: Jim Noel
Senior Safety, Jim Noel
What he's been: A contributor since day one, Noel has grown from back up to fill in starter, to a full time starter over three years. While primarily a safety, BC has also used him at corner. He missed a good portion of 2011, leaving our already depleted secondary without an impact player. Noel has never been a big hitter or ballhawk, but he's been good in coverage and done what's been asked.
What he needs to be: Noel needs to take over. Our defense is at its best when we have safeties with great anticipation. If you design your defense to exploit QB mistakes, you need a smart and athletic Safety to be in the right place at the right time. One of the reasons we struggled ending drives last year and giving up big plays to teams like Central Florida was because our safeties just couldn't make plays. Noel was doing his best filling in at Corner, while Syvlia, Hughes and Rositano kept getting burned. Hopefully Noel can focus on one area this year, stay healthy and have a big season.
Why I like his chances to shine: Look back on the interceptions Noel has made. They are often really great athletic plays. Few are gimmes that just landed in his hand. If he can be that great for 12 games and get even a little help from his other safeties, he will have a big year.
Last season BC only had 13 interceptions. It was our lowest output since the TOB years. If Noel can help end a few drives with big takeaways, BC could be a strong defensive team again.
Labels: Jim Noel, Key Players, Preseason
Precamp Depth Chart and other links
BC updated the depth chart in time for preseason camps to begin. This should be viewed as temporary and not who will start Labor Day weekend. There will be injuries and position switches that will alter things a bit. Hopefully no one is kicked off the team between now and the start of the season.
Florida DB Matt Milano committed to BC over the weekend. Milano also had offers from Arizona and Air Force.
Andy Katz listed BC among the possible destinations for BU transfer Jake O'Brien. Rumor is Providence is his most likely destination. I hope he gives BC a long look. He'd be another no risk big man for Donahue and give us some nice depth.

Coaches to Watch this fall Part 4: Current Offensive Coordinators
Since everyone has Spaz on the Hotseat List, now is as good a time as any to look at future BC head coaching candidates. Unlike our past profile series, the timing and style on these posts will be a little different. Instead of being weeks or days away from a potential change, we have the benefit of a whole season to evaluate these guys. Some stocks will rise, while others will fall and it will make our usual scoreboard watching that much more interesting.
The natural inclination would be for BC to replace Spaz with an offensive guy. Unfortunately there is not a great pool of candidates among current college offensive coordinators. There are plenty of good coordinators, but I don't know how many are ready to be head coaches or coach at a place like BC. These are some of the more prominent names. After the 2012 season, we'll have a better idea of if they are ready to take on an FBS head coaching job.
Chad Morris
Offensive Coordinator, Clemson
Chad Morris was coaching high school football three years ago. His meteoric rise to Clemson's playcaller is another example of how much college football has changed. Gus Malzahn and guys like Chip Kelly and Art Briles before him shot from relative obscurity to changing college football within a few season. Pedigree and climbing the ladders doesn't mean as much anymore. All that matters is how you score and Morris showed that he could give new life to Clemson's attack. Like the others mentioned Morris emphasized tempo and a no huddle. His track record is impressive, as is his reputation for teaching and implementing this offense.
What to Watch for in 2012: Can Clemson keep it up? The ACC now has a chance to adjust to his scheme. It will also be interested to know what Morris wants to do. All these guys want to be head coaches, but is he willing to roll the dice on a job like BC? Would he even fit in? BC's very different from coaching high school in west Texas.
Offensive Coordinator, Wisconsin
The Badgers have been a good proving ground for coordinators. I like the fit for BC since Wisconsin tends to develop and recruit like we do. They also have run ""pro style"" offenses with an emphasis on OL and the running attacks. Canada will be new there this fall, but he's got BCS experience and led explosive offenses in the MAC too. If Canada became a candidate for BC, I would have hesitation about his time at Indiana. They threw it a ton while he was calling plays but didn't win much.
What to Watch in 2012: Will Canada keep throwing it at the more conservative Wisconsin? If Wisconsin keeps up their recent success will he emerge as a candidate elsewhere?
Bill Lazor
Offensive Coordinator, Virginia
Lazor's been a good coordinator at Virginia. He's not changing the game but they've been better than they were before he got there and they've been consistent. Lazor's ACC experience -- especially at a school like UVA -- translates well to BC (as it did for TOB years ago). He can also sell his NFL ties to recruits. He played at Cornell and is from Scranton, so geography and academics wouldn't be an issue.
What to Watch for in 2012: How will UVA handle their pending QB controversy. Will they also move up within the ACC or stay middle of the pack offensively?
Offensive Coordinator, Alabama
Nussmeier moves from Washington to being the playcaller at the Defending National Champions. He's got a good profile for a rising coach in that he played professionally, coached in college, the NFL and Canada, and is now at an elite program. He runs a pro-style west coast offense, so the transition to BC would be relatively easy. Nussmeier lacks any obvious ties to BC or the northeast.
What to Watch in 2012: How will Nussmeier adjust to the pressure cooker of Saban and Alabama? Saban's offensives have been bland but effective. I expect more of the same this year. It doesn't make for compelling football but working for Saban can be good training for future head coaches.

Phil Steele thinks we will score more points this season.
Kevin Pierre-Louis was named to the Nagurski watch list.
Pennsylvania Tight End strongly considered BC but verballed to UConn instead. BC's interest seemed to fade as other Tight Ends/Defensive Ends committed.
Temple closed on Jersey prospect Jarred Alwan. That's a big coup considering how hard BC went after him.
Former Eagle Steve Hailey now coaches on the Boston AAU circuit. Maybe that will help us with local talent.
BC still has interest in Ohio RB Keith Watkins.

No King at BC may be a good thing
Nearly everything that needs to be said about Penn State and Joe Paterno has been said. But one point that Bruce Feldman made regarding College Football's King culture reminded me of how different BC is from most FBS schools. We don't and never have had a ""King."" I've often longed for that iconic winner that could serve as the face of the program, but maybe it is better that we don't. For whatever we miss by not having a ""Woody"" or a ""JoePa"" or ""Bear"" we also avoid the power struggles and corruption that often comes with an all-powerful Head Coach.
What does a King really provide anyway? Branding...a little nostalgia...someone to embrace. But it doesn't really win you football games or make you a better school. Florida State's losing in the final Bowden years proved that and Penn State has a permanent stain on their whole community because of their Kingdom.
BC's had some dynamic leaders, but none have ever stayed long enough to reach statue status. Our winningest coach and longest tenured even left and no one put up a fight to keep him. TOB could have been our icon. A little more fire and one or two more critical wins and we would have celebrated him like other schools have done with their biggest winners. But it wasn't to be and that's probably a good thing.
When I've profiled coaching candidates in the past, I've hoped that one would stay for a long time. That's changed. I don't want a guy who want to be bigger than the University. Things are better that way.

Key Players for 2012: Emmett Cleary
This is a series on the key players for the 2012 season. Big things are expected for some, while others will need to improve over their previous performances. If 2012 is a good year, it will be in part to the key players overachieving.
Senior Offensive Tackle, Emmett Cleary
What he's been: A long-time starter and one of the leaders on offense. Cleary has played on both sides of the line and at both guard and tackle. When he first arrived, Jags said that he could be the next Costanzo. Tall and lean (for a lineman) Cleary's been a consistent contributor like Costanzo (playing in 36 games and starting 26) yet he's never been the consistently great like Costanzo. How much of Cleary's occasional mistakes or setback are due to talent, coaching or the offense? I think it's been a bit of everything.
What he needs to be: Good isn't good enough anymore. Cleary takes on the big responsibility of left tackle this year. Rettig has been running for his life the past three years. If the offense is ever going to take off, they need to improve pass protection. That will start with Cleary. And in the ACC, he'll be facing some of the top defensive linemen in the country on a weekly basis. Cleary's always been good with speed guys on the edge. He'll also need to improve on run blocking. If Martin uses more stretches and zones like Logan, that will leave Cleary often sealing off edges on run plays.
Why I like his chances to shine: We've seen offensive lineman make huge leaps from season to season before. Part of it is maturing into their bodies and understanding the position. But a lot is coaching. I think Cleary has been underserved in that department. Even if Bollman is not some OL guru, I think Cleary playing in a more pass happy, up tempo offense will play to his strengths. I think his leadership position and the coaching staff's confidence in him will make him shine at LT. I think he will live up to his potential and have multiple games where he dominates and plays mistake free football. Plus he still has the NFL on his horizon. If he can perform at an elite level, he can jump up from a late round afterthought to a high-round pick.
I think if Cleary stays healthy, he shoot up draft boards. If BC's offense breaks out of its doldrums he'll be named an all conference player.

BC using coordinators as face(s) of the program?
BC posted this ""thank you"" video as an invite to a special practice for season ticket holders. Notice anyone missing? It is just a silly Youtbue video but I find it very telling that the school left out the Head Coach. This is college football. Your head coach is the face of the program. Ours isn't even mentioned in a direct marketing message to our most loyal customers.
There are many likely explanations for Spaz's absence. He's not particularly good on camera. He's never really shown any sort of enthusiasm for this sort of thing. And I think BC has heard enough to know that Spaz is not very popular with our fan base. No reason to trot him out when it will just dampen excitement about the upcoming season.
I like Bill McGovern and Doug Martin. Both are capable coordinators and leaders. Martin's been a head coach and I know McGovern wants to be one, so giving them face time is not a bad idea. Let's hope they are also given autonomy this year (which hasn't been Spaz's strong suit with coordinators). If these two are given real power, season ticket holders will probably be happy they renewed.

Optimism from Football Outsiders and other links
I am a sucker for football analytics and I also really respect CBS's Matt Hinton. So when his ACC preview piece on Football Outsiders listed BC with a .500 record and a 3rd place finish in the division, I was pleasantly surprised. FO is betting on our returning players and the positive trends of the last few games of 2011. I still don't know what to think about the upcoming season, but my love for BC and articles like this have me looking on the bright side.
BC is sending Emmett Cleary and Kaleb Ramsey to Greensboro to represent the school during ACC media days. I think this is actually a great sign for BC and for both players. I expected Cleary to have a break out season last year. He was good, but not all conference. Maybe this year is his chance to shine and get on NFL radars. Ramsey has always had the talent. His health and attitude have been bigger issues. If he is healthy and focused this year, he will be a game changer on D.
Here is more on our newest recruit out of Cincinnati Truman Gutapfel.
Chris Pantale is on the Mackey watch list. The award is given annually to the country's best Tight End.
Beaver Country Day big man Jacquil Taylor is generating local interest. BC has yet to offer, but is following him.
BCeagles.com posted a Q&A with Bobby Swiggert yesterday. I found his talk about paring down the offense encouraging. We need to work on execution not diversity of plays.
HD put out this offseason filler piece ranking coaching jobs in the ACC. I don't really care where she perceives us. When the job changes we will be very attractive to the right guy for us.

Where is the one that got away?
While we've struggled recruiting Massachusetts players this year, we've cleaned up in Connecticut and in Ohio. Those local kids (or other lay-up recruits) we miss generate plenty of frustration but they happen every year. What's fortunate about our misses though, is that very few have come back to haunt us. When was the last time a great recruit spurned BC and became a star? I can think of a few over the years, but most of the recruits that ""got away"" had middling careers elsewhere.
Some recent examples of guys who spurned us include Graham Stewart, Arthur Lynch and Joe Boisture. All three committed to BC at one point only to rethink their decisions and go to bigger programs. Stewart washed out at Florida and is now sitting out a transfer year at UConn. Boisture is out of football altogether. Lynch has been a backup at Georgia. He has a chance for a bigger role this season, but so far has not lived up to the hype that surrounded his recruitment. Even with our terrible offense, Chris Pantale has had a much more productive Tight End career.
The closest thing I can think of to a recent recruit who had success elsewhere is Virginia OT Oday Aboushi. But should he even count? He didn't spurn BC. Our admissions office turned him down after he verbaled to BC. Prior to that, you would have to go back to Dorian Bryant. But like Aboushi, his case was less about being seduced by a bigger, flashier program and more about not meeting BC's minimum standards for admissions at one point in time.
Where these guys all over-hyped by the recruiting services? Where they wrong fits at their post-BC choices? I don't know. I do think a program like BC is probably more patient with players than some of the bigger programs. We won't rush a guy out of the program to free up a scholarship. We prefer to redshirt. And I think the nature of a program -- with good academic support and less of a big school mentality -- keeps kids from falling through the cracks. Every recruit thinks they are going to be a star, so selling them on development and a safety net doesn't sway many, but it should. If anything BC should use a guy like Marcus Grant -- a local kid who left a Big Ten program to come ""home"" as an example to Massachusetts recruits. Massachusetts kids keep leaving to play at the ""highest level."" Our counter should be that we will develop them for life and the NFL (the real highest level) and not chew them up and spit them out like a football factory.
I am sure that there will be a guy in the near future who decommits from BC and becomes a star. Or a guy we should have had who leads another team to glory. Right now I am just glad that we have very few regrets when it comes to old recruits. Our recruiting still has major challenges, but that's one area where things have broken our way.
[Note to commentors: let me know if you think I missed any recruits who ""got away.""]

Key Players for 2012: Kevin Pierre-Louis
Junior Linebacker, Kevin Pierre-Louis
What he's been: BC's second-leading tackler. On most teams KPL would already be a star. But he played next to college football's tackling machine. There wasn't much room for headlines or an extra tackle with Luke Kuechly doing so much. Pierre-Louis also missed three games last year and played through pain in others. When healthy, he showed great anticipation and was a very solid tackler. In a way, he's a lot like Kuechly.
What he needs to be: KPL needs to be more of a game changer. He's got the speed and instincts to do it. Also, his role won't be in the middle, so he can take chances that Kuechly could not. Ideally he'd have a season like Herzy's 2008. Where on one play he's blitzing the QB and on the next he's running a fumble back. While our scheme has defined much of the defensive success the past five years, we've also benefited from great individual performances. To be great again, we need someone with the tools like KPL to become elite.
Why I like his chances to shine: KPL played really well in the first half of 2011. If he had stayed healthy, he would've been all conference. There's no reason he can't be even better this year. We'll miss Kuechly, but the defensive line might be better this year -- that will create more opportunities for big plays from Pierre-Louis. I also like his stats. His tackles for loss and pass break ups in a shortened season give me hope that he'll do even more when playing in all games and playing at 100%.
I think KPL takes off this year. I think he'll be first team ACC, lead BC with over 110 tackles, and have at least two INTs and two fumble recoveries.

Montel Harris to Temple now officially official
Although it's been rumored and reported multiple times over the past few months, Montel Harris finally enrolled in Temple over the weekend. Supposedly the delay was due to Harris completing his academic commitments to BC. To be eligible at Temple, Montel must have completed his BC degree.
All the past comments hold true for me. I hope Montel has a great end to his career and gets his shot at the NFL. He was a pleasure to watch the past four years.

What would Spaz need to do to hold on?
I've been speculating about new coaches all summer, but what if Spaz actually pulls through? Crystal Ball Run thinks it could happen. Ultimately it will come down to our record. In my opinion, this is how it would play out. Let me know your thoughts in the comments.
4-8 or worse...
Spaz is gone. Back to back 8 loss seasons would be too much. The diehards are already calling for his head. Another embarrassing and hard to watch season would kill goodwill among the casual BC fans.
8-4 or better...
Spaz is safe. We have the talent and the schedule to be this good. I don't think it will happen, but if it does we will see Year 5 of the Spaz era.
6 or 7 wins...
Spaz ""retires."" He gets his money. He gets to go out with a winning record. He saves face. This is probably the best outcome for everyone.
This is the unknown in my opinion. I could see the powers that be wanting to keep him one more year. Especially if we end on a high note.

Coaches to Watch this fall Part 3: Current Defensive Coordinators
BC has turned to college coordinators in the past to step up as Head Coach. While there is risk with any hire, the nice thing about a rising coordinator is that they've usually proven themselves adapt at one phase of the game and you have the chance to hire the next great football mind. Plus most coordinators come in hungry and hard working, looking to make the most of their first chance as a head coach. Because Spaz is a a defensive coach, I am sure BC fans will want a replacement with an offensive background, but that doesn't mean we should overlook these guys.
Pat Narduzzi
Defensive Coordinator, Michigan State
Until Bruce Feldman dropped his name as a Spaz replacement, I don't think many BC fans were even thinking about Narduzzi. On paper he's a very solid candidate. He's got BCS experience at Michigan State. The Spartans love him and recently gave him a huge raise. While they haven't been elite, I like what Michigan State has done under Dantonio (and Narduzzi). They overachieve given their talent base and work hard on the recruting front. Because of his stops in Cincinnati and growing up in northeast Ohio, Narduzzi has ties to our important midwest recruiting territories. What I like most about him as a candidate is his time at Rhode Island. I don't think our new head coach needs ties to BC, but I do think it helps if he comes in with an understanding of what BC is and can be. If you've coached at URI, you know what New England football is like. You know about the difference in fan interest and the space crunch BC is under. And you'll know that BC can be successful with the right coaching.
What to Watch for in 2012: How high Narduzzi's profile rises. He interviewed for head coaching jobs last year. If Michigan State continues to improve and Narduzzi earns more accolades, other schools will have interest.
Mark Stoops
Defensive Coordinator, Florida State
Normally I would worry about the fit of a guy like Stoops. He's coming from a football factory. His last name brings some good and bad baggage. But I do think there are some strong pluses in his candidacy at BC. Like Narduzzi, Stoops has deep ties to the Ohio Catholic high school circuit. He also has a good understanding of the ACC landscape after stops in Miami and Florida State. His FSU defenses still begin with the 4-3, so he could take our current roster and install his own system. Although the Stoops name isn't a household name in Boston, his track record, name and personality would be an easy sell to the BC faithful.
What to Watch for in 2012: How Florida State handles their expectations. If this is the year they finally return to being ""Florida State"" Stoops will get much of the credit and be a hot name. Even if they are good, not great, he's still viable at BC.
Defensive Coordinator, Texas
Due to his unusual path into coaching and his sudden rise, Diaz is a very hot name among coordinators. Aside from his time coaching at other ACC schools, there's not much tying him to BC. But I think his ability to recruit, his Xs and Os and the ability to be the face of the program deserve consideration. Diaz is young, but serving as a coordinator at Texas is a good proving ground. Mack Brown is in CEO mode, so his coordinators do much of the heavy lifting. It's great preparation for making the jump to head coach.
What to Watch for in 2012: TOB's potential retirement. Diaz is one of the names on many NC State wish lists. If TOB steps down, some in their fan base will make a big push for Diaz to return to Raleigh.
Defensive Coordinator, Notre Dame
Diaco is one of the most relentless recruiters in college football. If he took over at BC, I think we could upgrade our talent quickly. The New Jersey native has plenty of ACC experience and has recruited at schools with academic restrictions. I don't love his scheme (3-4) and have a few concerns about his defenses being good but never dominant. But he would be a very good fit at BC and worth the risk.
What to Watch for in 2012: An Irish implosion. Although his seat is not as hot as Spaz's, Kelly needs to win this year. If he's fired, we can't hire his fired defensive coordinator. The perception would be terrible among fans and recruits.

More people to follow
A little over a month ago, I posted a few BC related names that you should follow. Now, I have a few more...
BC Hockey Blog: twitter and blog. The diehard hockey fans already follow, but for those more casual BC hockey fans, this is a good place to keep up with our best team.
Warren K. Zola: twitter. BC's Assistant Dean of Graduate programs is pretty plugged into the student athlete scene at BC. He contributes to the Huffington Post on Sports Law, sports news and College Sports.
Lou Imbriano: twitter. The former Patriots executive and current BC professor tweets about a variety of sports and sports marketing news. In my opinion, BC should be leaning on him more with regards to how we market our programs.
BC Che Chi's: twitter. A parody account that only a BC alum would understand. Parody accounts are tough to sustain, but I look forward to Che Chi's contributions come football season.
Justin Rowland: twitter. The Rivals recruiting writer is breaking more and more BC news lately. If you follow recruiting, you should probably follow Rowland.

Pass the Van Nest koolaid and other links
The Globe's feature on 5th year basketball transfer Andrew Van Nest has me fired up. Aside from being a good story, what if this kid can actually play? I know he didn't see the court much at Harvard, but do you trust Tommy Amaker when it comes to managing a roster? The best part of the Van Nest situation is that there is no risk to BC. If he doesn't pan out, he is gone within a year. But who knows, maybe he can give us 10 minutes a game. We need another big body and 6'11 with shooting touch translates into most leagues.
Earlier in the week, the ACC locked in a deal with the Orange Bowl. There is still plenty of conjecture about what it means but there are some strong points in the deal. First the ACC will be able to sell the media rights. That gives us the chance to earn similar dollars to the Big Four conferences. Second, the Orange Bowl will be a New Year's Day game. That's huge as it should help travel and ticket sales. Finally Notre Dame will have an affiliation to the game. One more tie to the Irish is a good thing from a TV standpoint.
Connecticut WR Dave Coggins supposedly verbaled to BC the other day. Rivals says it is not a sure thing yet. BC offered a scholarship to Ohio Dlineman Truman Gutapfel. BC is hoping to get two Florida targets as a packaged deal.
Another Cincinnati-area BC target Evan Jansen committed to Indiana. BC also lost out to California offensive lineman Alex Redmond. Florida LB Nick Internicola seemed like a solid BC target, but he committed to Rutgers earlier this week.
Matt Humphrey is adjusting to his third college team.
Parker Milner has impressed the Bruins at their developmental camp.

History Lesson: the Eagle
In honor of the 4th of July, I thought it might be a good time to revisit one of the symbols BC shares with our great nation: the eagle.
Although the Eagle is now synonymous with BC through statues and other references on campus, we were without an official mascot during our first few decades. In 1920 the Heights published a cartoon showing a cat licking a plate of its sports rivals. Yes, we could have been the ""Cats."" While that would have inspired plenty of nicknames and unique imagery, Father McLaughlin didn't think a cat was the proper representative for our university. He suggested the eagle due to its majesty, power and freedom. We officially became the ""Eagles"" that same year.
Contrary to millions of sports writers' work, we are not the ""golden eagles."" And despite Baldwin's looks and name we are not the ""bald eagles"" either.
Two other FBS programs also use the eagle as their mascot. Like us Eastern Michigan is just the Eagles. Southern Mississippi uses Golden Eagles.
I can't find any evidence that McLaughlin wanted to tie BC's symbols to those of the United States, but it is a nice connection.

More Turf news
This is bordering on overkill, but I am going all in...
The good people at AstroTurf have premiered a live video feed of the Alumni Stadium turf installation. Now instead of spending your holiday week outdoors with family and friends, you can watch as synthetic grass is laid down in Chestnut Hill.

Keep fighting the good fight Lax diehards!
AJ's tweet brought the following comments on BC's Facebook page to my attention. After BC posted an update on the new field, Gene and Spaz's critics took to Facebook to vent. The usual complaints about both guys, tailgating and the state of the program filled the discussion. But what stood out to me was one simple comment from Connor Wilson: ""bring back lacrosse."" I don't share the BC Lax community's mission, but I respect their passion. Lacrosse is never coming back, but that doesn't mean BC shouldn't hear about it every day.

Anderson interview and other links
BCeagles.com posted a Q&A with Ryan Anderson. He talked about his summer break and his new teammates. Hopefully the new guys are as far along as Anderson feels they are.
HD is banking on our experience as a reason we could surprise people this year.
BC keeps hitting Ohio prospects hard. The latest target is Cinci LB Marcus Oliver.
Here is more on future Eagle Dan Monteroso. Monteroso also generated some interest from basketball schools. Maybe Spaz will let him play basketball in the Spring.
This matrix took a different look at the Hot Seat issue. With regards to losing and underachieving, Spaz is not as bad as some of the bigger names on the list.
Former eagles Carolyn Swords and Molly Schaus discussed how Title IX impacted their sporting careers.

NFL attendance problems a lesson for BC
BC's faced some attendance issues the past few years. We like to blame the tailgating or Spaz or the schedule, but the reality is there are multiple factors. Just look at the attendance issues facing the most popular league in American sports -- the NFL. If they can't get butts in the seats, how can BC? The NFL has a few different solutions in play. Perhaps, BC can learn from them.
Fewer Seats
The NFL is lowering the bar, so that blackout rules don't require sellouts. Blackouts are not an issue in college, but perhaps few seats will help demand and make Alumni seem full. I don't want to tear out seats, but maybe we can replace the bleachers with actual seats. That would take up more space, eliminate seats and improve the watching experience.
The internet has added fluidity to the ticket market. It used to be BC fans would buy season ticket packages to assure themselves Notre Dame tickets or some other desirable game. Now most know that they can buy the game they want without committing to others they don't. One way to win them back is to lower the investment. BC will miss out on the mark up of the premium games, but at least they will have more people invest in a whole season. BC is indirectly doing this already with their discounts of the less desirable games. If the NFL is lowering prices on parking and concessions, BC should also explore it. Like the NFL we are getting more and more money from TV. Why not make the ingame experience more affordable.
In-game experience
This has been discussed ad nauseum, but needs to be looked at again. I don't think it is as simple as the NFL's push for wireless. We need the game day experience to be inviting from the moment the gates open to the moment the last fan is leaving. It is about the music, the ushers, the video boards, the halftime, the activities during commercial breaks. I don't want BC to turn into a barrage of nonsense, but we can do more.
I don't go to many BC games. That's mostly because of my location. But I also like the watching the game in my home. The convenience, the visuals, and the costs all factor into my decision. But live sports is still a great experience...especially college football. I just hope BC doesn't wait around until the Alumni is empty.",['August 25.'],10337,multifieldqa_en,en,,d2a588e420083f151239e660bd47ec0cad9732ec308ab9bc," Chase Rettig will be asked to make quick decisions and get the ball out fast. He's started 21 games. Doug Martin will finally have an experienced OC running a current, simple offense. The quarterback has yet to have a memorable BC moment or done anything to get on an NFL radar. He completed just over half of his passes last year and never put together back-to-back great games nor enough sustained drives. The offensive line has been terrible, leaving Chase running for his life. The QB's can make huge leaps with a new offense. Just look at Dominique Davis. He went to East Carolina and became one of the most accurate passers in the country. He has never had a rhythm and a confidence he's never had at BC.Rich Thompson will cover BC football this season for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. For more on the 2012 BC football season, go to the iReport.com page and follow Rich Thompson on Twitter at @RichThompson and @AJ_Sparrow. For the full 2012 BC season preview, visit the CNN iReport page and visit the page and page. Rich Thompson has been assigned to the BC beat for this Fall's football season. Thompson is a welcome addition, as the Herald's focus has been spotty since Steve Conroy started splitting his time on hockey. Boston is ideal because the local universities could already supply many of the venues. The big obstacle would always be the main stadium for Track & Field and the opening and closing ceremonies. London may provide a solution. They built their Olympic Stadium as a temporary venue. It looked great on TV, holds enough for the games and can be shrunk as soon as it all wraps up. It would be a backdoor way to get the IOC to fix the air conditioning in Conte. It's a shame to see the beat neglected like it is across town. I would still love to see Boston host the games. I am practical too. This wouldn't just be a vanity project for BC. Can a casual fan name our best players? With the team coming off its worst season i can't believe that Chase Rettig is considered the 10th best. I think he could be even better by the end of the year. With Kuechly gone, BC doesn't have that player or coach. Spaz is not a compelling public speaker. No BC player made the ACC's preseason all conference team. This is our first tour under Donahue and a critical chance for this team to get better. The team leaves Boston on August 25. In each city they will practice and see some of the local sights. They also have community service time scheduled. Classes will be played with international rules, FIBA balls and FIBA rules, but they don't know if the referees will speak any English. For any Eagle fans in Spain, try to catch a game or two. It should be fun for any of the fans in any city they go to. It will be a great way to get to know the city and the people. It's a great opportunity for the team to bond and learn from each other. It'll be great for the fans to see the team play together and at a high level during a dead period. It won't be perfect, but it'll be a good start to the season. It could be the start of a great season. Dominic Appiah is a sophomore defensive tackle who surprised many last year. Appiah and Kaleb Ramsey will be key to BC's defense in 2012. The ACC Media voted BC 5th overall in the Atlantic Division. Virginia Athlete Atem Ntantang committed to BC last week. The team will play in the ACC Kickoff Game on September 7 in Charlotte, N.C. The game will be broadcast on the ACC Digital Network, which is running a countdown of great moments from the past two seasons. It doesn't have Chris Fowler yelling ""Lane Stadium goes silent"" but it does have Meter losing it. It will be interesting to see if BC benefits from the looming exodus at Penn State. But I wonder if Spaz will have any hesitation in taking advantage of his alma mater. And here is all the players together, including those about biology and chemistry. The field and wall finished yesterday. I think I think the field finished yesterday as well. I also think all the newspaper guys (including emmett cleary) will write up their interviews from Sunday into Monday posts. And I took down the video since it was auto playing for people. The ACC convenes this weekend in Greensboro for the annual ACC Media Days. I don't expect anything particularly revealing, but I would like to hear Spaz talk about the pressure of the season. BCeagles.com put out another player Q&A, this time with basketball transfer Alex Dragicevich. The bloggers at Atlantic Coast Convos have great taste as they listed our fight song as the best in the ACC. BC basketball fans will enjoy this pic of the early '90s starsAlthough she still has more years of high school volleyball to go, Brittany Pavich committed to BC earlier this week.From in the article on new commitment Myles Willis, here is an article onBaseball player John Nicklas. The next step will be hearing how the players like the look and feel of the Astro Turf at Alumni Stadium. I will try to check out one of his games this fall. It seems like it is over and he seems like a good pickup. He plays for local Atlanta power Marist. He talks about his summer training and trying to win another National Championship. He has two more years to make an impact on the team. Ian White has played a lot and almost all of it at guard. The offensive line play really started falling apart after Matt Tennant left. I think Centers are underappreciated...at times even by their own coaches. I pray things are different with Bollman. I still think Chase Rettig can be great. I have real hope for Doug Martin and think our WR and TE talent is good enough. The biggest question is the offensive line. But as someone who has preached for a OL coaching change, I keep telling myself that Bollman will make a difference. It is not an all star lineup, but I think our front seven will be better than last year. We play three of our first four at home. Playing FSU and Georgia Tech on back-to-back weeks is a bit rough, but playing Georgia Tech any time forces a team to regroup. If you have to play a gimmick offense, you might as well do it after facing a top 10 team. Maybe it will serve as a rally point after playing the 'Noles. When I look at the Seniors on a high year, I think that positive energy and emotion will carry us to an extra win or two. Jim Noel has grown from back up to fill in starter, to a full time starter over three years. Noel has never been a big hitter or ballhawk, but he's been good in coverage and done what's been asked. Chad Morris was coaching high school football three years ago. Gus Malzahn and guys like Chip Kelly and Art Briles before him shot from relative obscurity to changing college football within a few season. All that matters is how you score and Morris showed that he can do that in college football. The natural inclination would be for BC to replace Spaz with an offensive guy. There are plenty of good coordinators, but I don't know how many are ready to be head coaches or coach at a place like BC. This is as good a time as any to look at future BC head coaching candidates. After the 2012 season, we'll have a better idea of if they are ready for an FBS head coaching job. The depth chart is temporary and not who will start Labor Day weekend. There will be injuries and position switches that will alter things a bit. Hopefully no one is kicked off the team between now and the start of the season. could give new life to Clemson's attack. Like the others mentioned Morris emphasized tempo and a no huddle. Canada will be new there this fall, but he's got BCS experience and led explosive offenses in the MAC too. Lazor's ACC experience -- especially at a school like UVA -- translates well to BC (as it did for TOB years ago) Nussmeier lacks any obvious ties to BC or the northeast. He played at Cornell and is from Scranton, so geography and academics wouldn't be an issue. He can also sell his NFL ties to recruits. BC's interest seemed to fade as other Tight Ends/Defensive Ends committed. That's a big coup considering how hard BC went after Jersey prospect Jarred Alwan. Former Eagle Steve Hailey now coaches on the Boston AAU circuit. Maybe that will help us with local talent. BC still has interest in Ohio RB Keith Watkins. It is better that we don't have a ""King"" at BC. For whatever we miss by not having a ""Woody"" or a ""JoePa"" or ""Bear"" we also avoid the power and corruption that comes with an all-powerful Head Coach. But it doesn't win you football games or make you a better team. Emmett Cleary takes on the big responsibility of left tackle this year. Cleary has played on both sides of the line and at both guard and tackle. If Cleary stays healthy, he'll be named an all conference player. If he can perform at an elite level, he can jump up from a late round afterthought to a high-round pick. If 2012 is a good year, it will be in part to the key players overachieving. If BC's offense breaks out of its doldrums, Cleary could be an all-conference player. He'll also need to improve on run blocking. He will live up to his potential and have multiple games where he dominates and plays mistake free football. He's not particularly good on camera. He has never really shown any sort of enthusiasm for this sort of thing. No reason to dampen excitement about the upcoming season when it will just dampen him out. He could have been our icon. A little more fire and one or two more critical wins and we would have celebrated him like other schools have done with their biggest winners. But it wasn't to be and that's probably a good thing. BC is sending Emmett Cleary and Kaleb Ramsey to Greensboro to represent the school during ACC media days. Chris Pantale is on the Mackey watch list. The closest thing I can think of to a recent recruit who had success elsewhere is Virginia OT Oday Aboushi. Our admissions office turned him down after he verbaled to BC. Where are these guys all over-hyped by the recruiting services? I don't think a program like BC is probably more patient with players than some of the bigger programs. We need to work on execution not diversity of plays. When the job changes we will be very attractive to the right guy for us. We won't be able to compete with the big schools in the ACC this year, but we can compete with them in the Big East and the Pac-12. We have a good chance of winning the ACC Coastal Division this season, but it will take a lot more than a few wins to get to the next round of the ACC Championship Game. We will be looking for a new head coach by the end of the season, and we'll be looking to hire a new offensive coordinator as well. Kevin Pierre-Louis has been BC's second-leading tackler. The defensive line might be better this year, creating more opportunities for big plays. Montel Harris finally enrolled in Temple over the weekend. Spaz is back to back 8-8 loss seasons, which would be ""embarrassing and hard to watch"" and ""embarassing"" for his head coach, Crystal Runners. ""I think he'll be first team ACC, lead BC with over 110 tackles, and have at least two INTs and two fumble recoveries,"" Joe Boisture says. ""If he had stayed healthy, he would've been all conference. There's no reason he can't be even better,"" Graham Stewart says of Pierre- Louis. ""He's got the speed and instincts to do it. To be great again, we need someone with the tools like KPL to become elite,"" Runners says of the junior linebacker. ""It would play out how the Ball Runners pull out of this, this is how it would be,"" Crystal Runnings says of Spaz's back-to-back 8-4 seasons. ""The diehards are already calling for his return"" Spaz is safe. We have the talent and the schedule to be this good. I don't think it will happen, but if it does we will see Year 5 of the Spaz era. Because Spaz is a a defensive coach, I am sure BC fans will want a replacement with an offensive background. I like what Michigan State has done under Dantonio (and Narduzzi). They overachieve given their talent base and work hard on the recruting front. If this is the year they finally return to being ""Florida State"" Stoops will get much of the credit and be a hot name. Even if they are good, not great, he's still viable at BC. I think his ability to recruit, his Xs and Os deserve consideration. Diaz is young, but serving as a coordinator at Texas is good preparation for making the jump to head coach. It would kill goodwill among the casual BC fans if Brown is in CEO mode. It's time to watch for Mack Brown's TO's in 2012. It is time to Watch for Brown's ToB's in to Watch in 2012: 2012. If TOB steps down, some in their fan base will make a big push for Diaz to return to Raleigh. Notre Dame defensive coordinator Diaco is one of the most relentless recruiters in college football. The ACC will be able to sell the media rights to the Orange Bowl. BC is hoping to get two Florida targets as a packaged deal. Matt Humphrey is adjusting to his third college team at the University of California, Los Angeles. The Bruins have impressed the developmental camp at their developmental camp in California, where they are training players for the 2013 season. The BC Hockey Blog is a good place to keep up with our best team. The Globe's feature on 5th year basketball transfer Andrew Van Nest has me fired up. The best part of the Van Nest situation is that there is no risk to BC. If he doesn't pan out, he is gone within a year. We need another big body and 6'11 with shooting touch translates into most leagues. The Orange Bowl will be a New Year's Day game. That's huge as it should help travel and ticket sales. Finally Notre Dame will have an affiliation to the game. The Eagle is now synonymous with BC through statues and other references on campus. In 1920 the Heights published a cartoon showing a cat licking a plate of its sports rivals. Two other FBS programs also use the eagle as their mascot.

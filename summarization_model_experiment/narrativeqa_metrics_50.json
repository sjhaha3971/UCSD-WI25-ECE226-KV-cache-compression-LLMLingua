\"The Count's Wife,\" by Jean-Baptiste Lamarque, and published in Paris in 1847. The Count's wife, Madame de Merret, died in her sleep in her bed at the Chateau of Ch\u00e2lons-Drouot, France, in 1848. The author has never met the Count, but has heard stories of his wife's many lovers and of his love for the Count. He tells how the Count took a diamond from his wife, and gave it to him as a present. He also tells how he bought an \"Imitation of Christ\" lamp and a chair for his wife for her bed. He writes: 'My dear sir, if you had seen, as I then saw, that vast room, papered with brown, you would have felt yourself transported into a scene of a romance. It was icy, nay more, funereal,' and he lifts his hand with a theatrical gesture and pauses. 'I stood motionless absorbed in looking at a sort of a stupor, and I am still there still. At last her large eyes moved; she tried to raise her right hand, but it fell back on the bed, and she uttered these words, which came like a breath, for her voice was no longer a voice. In short, it was horrible to behold! Sickness so consumed that woman, that she was no more purposefully than a phantom. I have not heard the least sound, I did not perceive the least movement, which ought to have given the sufferer's breathing to have been given to the sheets covered her, but I waited for her to say, \"I have waited for you for a long time\" \"I saw the dying woman whiter than her sheets; her eyes frighten me; I shall dream of her to-night.--But you must have formed some idea as to the instructions contained in thatextraordinary will' The will of the testatrix still makes me shudder as I think of it. There was joy in her last glance, and it remained stamped on her dead eyes.\" \"I brought away the will, and when it was opened I found that Madame deggieMerret had appointed me her executor\" \"I sat down in my chair with my feet on the fire-dogs, and I had lost myself in a romance,\" he said. \"I closed my door, having been roused from my apathy by a woman's cautious hand on the door's hinges, and saw my land on the hinges, which I saw by a cautious woman's hand turned on my land. I saw the land on my hand, when a woman opened the door, and turned the hinges on my land, and in my hand I saw my wife's hand. I sat down and I said, \"Madame,\" I began. She signed to me to be silent. At that moment the old housekeeper rose and said in my ear, \"Do not speak, Madame la\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Comtesse is not in a state to bear the slightest noise, and what you say might agitate her.\" \"Oh! God! Oh!\" and that was all. She clutched a crucifix thatlay on the bed, lifted it hastily to her lips, and died. But these were her last words: \"I place my will inyour hands--Oh!\" \"I saw her face, and she said, 'To last as long as that--to last past sixty past sixty--to be long as long, not now.' \" \"And I said: 'I will never marry another woman to take her place or ever love her as I love you.' \" \"And so it was,\" he replied, \"and I will always marry her.\" \"And that was the end of the story\" \"And the beginning of the beginning,\" he added, \"of the story of how I came to know my wife.\"", "The Vervelle couple believes Grassou is the perfect match for Virginie.", "Charles X.", "It rises up from the bathtub.", "That people will talk in New York and not in her town.", "He is an expert in anti-gravity rays.", "Yoichi is seen", "Socrates proposes three ethical arguments.", "He was not liked by them.", "1927", "He was chased by the police.", "The laws of Athens", "The wife of Frank Saltram.", "Reiko's job is to take care of her master's needs.", "He will not be able to live a good life if he does not follow their wishes.", "He is killed by a group of cops after he is caught with a large bag of coke.", "She kept it to herself for a time, then decided to marry Gravener after he returned from Australia.", "The teens faces were described as twisted and misshapen.", "He is asked to write an essay for the Yellow Book.", "The movie ends with the statement that the video is the \"pure manifestation of Sadako's\" and that she has been cursed by her ability to kill people with just a thought.", "The woman.", "read to her", "Chlorophage", "He loved her and was concerned about her well-being.", "He was caught in a fire.", "To solve a mystery", "Vigo", "She is expected to marry a wealthy man and take on her duties as a lady.", "The brownstone.", "Ikuo Hayata", "Gorgia, ancient Greece.", "She threw herself into the well.", "He was being charged with murder.", "He wore a soft black hat", "One of his men.", "The story begins with Mary Wollstonecraft, who is the daughter of Edward, who marry Eliza, a gentle, fashionable girl.

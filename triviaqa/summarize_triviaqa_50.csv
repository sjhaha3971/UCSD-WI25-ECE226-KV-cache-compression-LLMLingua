Adam's apple
The laryngeal prominence (commonly referred to as Adam's apple), a feature of the human neck, is the lump or protrusion that is formed by the angle of the thyroid cartilage surrounding the larynx.

Structure

The structure of the laryngeal prominence forms a bump under the skin. It is larger in adult men, in whom it is usually clearly visible and palpable. In women, the bump is much less visible and is hardly perceived on the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage. 

The meeting point of the two portions of the cartilage generally forms an acute angle (of about 90°) in men, while in women it forms an open arc (of about 120°).

Sex difference

Although both sexes have it, the Adam's apple is considered to be a characteristic feature of adult men, because its size tends to increase considerably during puberty. 

Its development is considered a secondary sexual characteristic of males that appears as a result of hormonal activity. Its level of development varies among individuals and the widening of that area in the larynx can occur very suddenly and quickly.

The laryngeal prominence is more prominent in adult males than in females because of the difference in the size of the angle: 90° in males and 120° in females.

Function 

The Adam's apple, in conjunction with the thyroid cartilage which forms it, helps to protect the walls and the frontal part of the larynx, including the vocal cords (which are located directly behind it). It is found in both women and men.

Another function of the laryngeal prominence is related to the deepening of the voice. During adolescence, the thyroid cartilage grows together with the larynx. Consequently, the laryngeal prominence grows in size mainly in men. Together, a larger soundboard is made up in phonation apparatus and, as a result, the man gets a deeper voice note.  

Society and culture

Cosmetic surgery to reduce the size of laryngeal prominence is called chondrolaryngoplasty (thyroid chondroplasty).  The surgery is effective, such that complications tend to be few and, if present, transient. 

History

Etymology

There are two main theories as to the origin of the term ""Adam's apple"". 
The ""Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable"" and the 1913 edition of Webster's Dictionary point at an ancient belief that a piece of forbidden fruit was embedded in Adam's throat (the first man, according to Abrahamic religions).  However, neither the Bible nor other Judeo-Christian Islamic writings mention such a story. In fact, the biblical story does not even specify the type of fruit that Adam ate. 

Linguist Alexander Gode claimed that the Latin phrase to designate the laryngeal prominence was very probably translated incorrectly from the beginning. The phrase in Latin was ""pomum Adami"" (literally: 'Adam's apple'). This, in turn, came from the Hebrew ""tappuach ha adam"" meaning ""apple of man"". The confusion lies in the fact that in Hebrew language the proper name ""Adam"" (אדם) literally means ""man"", while the late Hebrew word used to refer  ""bump"" is very similar to the word used to refer ""apple"".   Proponents of this version contend that the subsequent phrases in Latin and other Romance languages represent a mistranslation from the start. 

The medical term ""prominentia laryngea"" was introduced by the Basle Nomina Anatomica in 1895. 

In the American South, goozle is used colloquially to describe the Adam's apple, likely derived from guzzle.

Passage:
Uranophobia
Fear of heaven, also known by its Greek-derived name uranophobia or ouranophobia, is a phobia that makes its sufferer fear heaven or the sky. 

The origin of the word urano is Greek, meaning heaven, while phobia is Greek for fear.

Causes

The causes of Uranophobia, as with other phobias, can be linked to a combination of external events and internal susceptibility - of brain chemistry and life experiences.

Fear of heaven may more specifically be related to the dread of punishment in the afterlife.  Psychoanalysis would see this as an animistic projection of the threatening and punitive powers of the parents  - heaven or the sky being a relatively late stage in the detachment of the superego from the actual parents. 

Jewish tradition

Jewish tradition highly valorised the fear of heaven, seeing it as a positive force linked both to wisdom and to personal humility. 

Literary examples

W. B. Yeats in his poem 'The Cold Heaven' asked rhetorically whether after death the ghost is:

""stricken By the injustice of the skies for punishment?”
Question:
Uranophobia is the irrational fear of which place or state of bliss?
Answer:
Heaven

The Three-Cornered Hat
El sombrero de tres picos (The Three-Cornered Hat or Le tricorne) is a ballet choreographed by Léonide Massine to music by Manuel de Falla, commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev and premiered complete in 1919. It is not only a ballet with Spanish setting but one that also employs the techniques of Spanish dance (adapted and somewhat simplified) instead of classical ballet.   

The story – a magistrate infatuated with a miller's faithful wife attempts to seduce her – derives from the novella by Pedro Antonio de Alarcón (born in Granada) and has been traced in film several times, usually in Spanish. The music has these sections:

Act I
*Introducción — Introduction
*Atardecer - Sunset
*Danza de la molinera (Farruca) — Dance of the Miller's Wife 
*Las uvas — The Grapes
Act II
*Danza de los vecinos (Seguidillas) — Dance of the Neighbors
*Danza del molinero (Farruca) — Dance of the Miller
*Danza del corregidor — Dance of the Magistrate
*Danza final (Jota)

Composition History 

As El corregidor y la molinera

During World War I Manuel de Falla wrote a pantomime ballet in two scenes and called it The Magistrate and the Miller's Wife (El corregidor y la molinera). The work was scored for a small chamber orchestra and was performed in 1917.

As El sombrero de tres picos

Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes, saw the premiere of El corregidor y la molinera and commissioned Falla to rewrite it. The outcome was a two-act ballet scored for large orchestra called The Three-Cornered Hat (El sombrero de tres picos). This was first performed in London at the Alhambra Theatre on 22 July 1919. Sets and costumes were created by Pablo Picasso. Choreography was by Léonide Massine. Diaghilev asked Falla to conduct the premiere but the composer felt he was not experienced enough to conduct a work so complex and he handed the baton to Ernest Ansermet after one rehearsal. 
Synopsis 

Act One 

After a short fanfare the curtain rises revealing a mill in Andalusia. The miller is trying to teach a pet blackbird to tell the time. He tells the bird to chirp twice, but instead it chirps three times. Annoyed, the miller scolds the bird and tells it to try again. The  bird now chirps four times. The miller gets angry at the bird again and his wife offers it a grape. The bird takes the grape and chirps twice. The miller and his wife laugh over this and continue their work. 

Soon the magistrate, his wife, and their bodyguard pass by, taking their daily walk. The procession goes by and the couple returns to their work. The dandified, but lecherous, magistrate is heard coming back. The miller tells his wife that he will hide and that they will play a trick on the magistrate. 

The miller hides and the magistrate sees the miller's wife dancing. After her dance she offers him some grapes. When the magistrate gets the grapes the miller's wife runs away with the magistrate following her. Finally he catches her, and the miller jumps out of a bush with a stick. The miller chases the magistrate away and the miller and his wife continue working.

Act Two 

That night, guests are at the miller's house. The miller dances to entertain them. His dance is interrupted by the magistrate's bodyguard, who has come to arrest him on trumped-up charges. After the miller is taken away, the guests leave one by one. The miller's wife goes to sleep and soon the magistrate comes to the mill. On his way to the door the magistrate trips and falls in the river. The miller's wife wakes up and runs away. 

The magistrate undresses and hangs his clothes on a tree and goes to sleep in the miller's bed. The miller has escaped from prison and sees the magistrate in his bed. The miller thinks that the magistrate is sleeping with his wife and plans to switch clothes with the magistrate and avenge himself by seducing the magistrate's wife. The miller leaves, dressed as the magistrate, and the magistrate soon wakes up. He goes outside and sees that his clothes are gone, so he dresses in the miller's clothes. The bodyguard comes and sees the magistrate dressed as the miller and goes to arrest him. The miller's wife sees the bodyguard fighting with what looks like her husband and joins in the fight. The miller comes back and sees his wife in the fight and joins it to protect her. The magistrate explains the entire story and the ballet ends with the miller's guests tossing the magistrate up and down in a blanket.

The Music 

Throughout the ballet Falla uses traditional Andalusian folk music. The two songs sung by the mezzo-soprano are examples of cante jondo singing; this typically accompanies flamenco music and tells a sad story. At one point he quotes the opening of Beethoven's 5th Symphony. 

Recordings 

There are many recordings of the complete ballet, as well as of the suites extracted from it. In the early 1960s Ernest Ansermet, the original conductor of the work, recorded it in stereo for London Records (aka Decca). The music was played by the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and the cante-jondo soloist was Teresa Berganza. It has also been recorded by such conductors as Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos and Jesús López-Cobos, and Leonard Bernstein has recorded the two suites from the ballet with the New York Philharmonic.

The original pantomime El corregidor y la molinera has been recorded by Josep Pons and Orquestra del Teatro Lliure for Harmonia Mundi.

Film versions 

The Paris Opera Ballet has recently issued a performance of the complete ballet on a DVD entitled Picasso and Dance. The performance uses not only Massine's original choreography, but actual reproductions of Picasso's sets and costumes. It is, so far, the only performance of the ballet issued on video.

Passage:
Arctic Circle
The Arctic Circle is the most northerly of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth. The region north of this circle is known as the Arctic, and the zone just to the south is called the Northern Temperate Zone. North of the Arctic Circle, the sun is above the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore visible at midnight) and below the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore not visible at noon); this is also true within the equivalent polar circle in the Southern Hemisphere, the Antarctic Circle.

The position of the Arctic Circle is not fixed; as of , it runs  north of the Equator.  Its latitude depends on the Earth's axial tilt, which fluctuates within a margin of 2° over a 40,000-year period, due to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the Moon.  Consequently, the Arctic Circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about 15 m per year.

Etymology 

The word ""arctic"" comes from the Greek word ἀρκτικός (arktikos: ""near the Bear, northern"")  and that from the word ἄρκτος (arktos: ""bear"").  The name refers either to the constellation Ursa Major, the ""Great Bear"", which is prominent in the northern portion of the celestial sphere, or to the constellation Ursa Minor, the ""Little Bear"", which contains Polaris, the Pole star, also known as the North Star. 

Midnight sun and polar night

The Arctic Circle is the southernmost latitude in the Northern Hemisphere at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for twenty-four hours; as a result, at least once each year at any location within the Arctic Circle the sun is visible at local midnight, and at least once it is not visible at local noon.  

Directly on the Arctic Circle these events occur, in principle, exactly once per year: at the June and December solstices, respectively. However, because of atmospheric refraction and mirages, and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point, part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the northern summer solstice up to about 50 minutes (′) (90 km) south of the Arctic Circle; similarly, on the day of the northern winter solstice, part of the sun may be seen up to about 50′ north of the Arctic Circle. That is true at sea level; those limits increase with elevation above sea level, although in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the true horizon.

Human habitation

Relatively few people live north of the Arctic Circle due to the severe climate; nonetheless, some areas have been settled for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. Tens of thousands of years ago, waves of people migrated from eastern Siberia across the Bering Strait into North America and gradually eastward to settle. Much later, in the historic period, there has been migration into some Arctic areas by Europeans and other immigrants.

The largest communities north of the Arctic Circle are situated in Russia and Norway: Murmansk (population 307,257), Norilsk (175,365), Tromsø (71,295) and Vorkuta (70,548). Rovaniemi (61,329) in Finland is the largest settlement in the immediate vicinity of the Arctic Circle lying slightly south of the line.

In contrast, the largest North American community north of the Arctic Circle, Sisimiut (Greenland), has approximately 5,000 inhabitants. Of the Canadian and United States Arctic communities, Barrow, Alaska is the largest settlement with about 4,000 inhabitants.

Geography

The Arctic Circle is roughly  long.  (A different source says . ) The area north of the Circle is about  and covers roughly 4% of Earth's surface. 

The Arctic Circle passes through the Arctic Ocean, the Scandinavian Peninsula, North Asia, Northern America and Greenland. The land within the Arctic Circle is divided among eight countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States (Alaska), Canada, Denmark (Greenland), and Iceland (where it passes through the small offshore island of Grímsey).

Climate

The climate inside the Arctic Circle is generally cold, but the coastal areas of Norway have a generally mild climate as a result of the Gulf Stream, which makes the ports of northern Norway and northwest Russia ice-free all year long. In the interior, summers can be quite warm, while winters are extremely cold. For example, summer temperatures in Norilsk (Russia) will sometimes reach as high as 30 C, while the winter temperatures frequently fall below .

Sites along the Arctic Circle

Starting at the prime meridian and heading eastwards, the Arctic Circle passes through:

There are many recordings of the complete ballet, as well as of the suites extracted from it. Leonard Bernstein has recorded the two suites from the ballet with the New York Philharmonic. The original pantomime El corregidor y la molinera has been recorded by Josep Pons and Orquestra del Teatro Lliure for Harmonia Mundi. The Paris Opera Ballet has recently issued a performance of the ballet on a DVD entitled Picasso and Dance. The performance uses not only Massine's original choreography, but actual reproductions of Picasso's sets and costumes. It is, so far, the only performance of this ballet issued on video. The word Arctic comes from the Greek word ""arktos"" (Great Bear), which refers to the constellation Ursa Minor, the prominent in the northern hemisphere. North of the Arctic Circle, the sun is above the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore visible at midnight) and below the horizon in the Southern Hemisphere, the Antarctic Circle. The Arctic Circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about 15 m per year. As of, it runs north of the Equator. Its latitude depends on the Earth's axial tilt, which fluctuates within a margin of 2° over a 40,000-year period, due to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the Moon. Its position is not fixed; as of, it runs  north of the Equator, and the zone just to the south is called the Northern Temperate Zone. The region north of this circle is known as the Arctic. The name refers either to the Ursa Major, the celestial sphere, or to the Great Bear, which is prominent in northern Europe and the northern Uruguayan region of Spain. It has also been called the ""Arctic Circle"" or the ""Great Bear"" The Arctic Circle is the southernmost latitude in the Northern Hemisphere at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for twenty-four hours. At least once each year at any location within the Arctic Circle the sun is visible at local midnight, and at least once it is not seen at local noon. The area north of the Circle is about and covers roughly 4% of Earth's surface. The largest communities north of Arctic Circle are situated in Russia and Norway: Murmansk (population 307,257), Norilsk (175,365), Tromsø (71,295) and Vorkuta (70,548). Rovaniemi (61,329) in Finland is the largest settlement in the immediate vicinity of the Arctic circle lying slightly south of the line. Of the Canadian and U.S Arctic communities, Barrow, Alaska is thelargest settlement with about 4,000 inhabitants. The land within the circle is divided among eight countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States (Alaska), Canada, Denmark (Greenland), and Iceland (where it passes through the small offshore island of Grímsey). In the interior, summers can be quite warm, while winters are extremely cold. For example, summer temperatures in Norilk (Russia) will sometimes reach as high as 30 C, while the winter temperatures frequently fall below 10 C. The climate inside the Arctic circles is generally cold, but the coastal areas of Norway have a generally mild climate as a result of the Gulf Stream, which makes the ports of northern Norway and northwest Russia ice-free all year long.What a Country! is an American sitcom that aired in syndication from September 27, 1986 to May 23, 1987.

","Passage:
Menlo Park, New Jersey
Menlo Park is an unincorporated community located within Edison Township in Middlesex County, New Jersey, United States. 

In 1876, Thomas Edison set up his home and research laboratory in Menlo Park, which at the time was the site of an unsuccessful real estate development named after the town of Menlo Park, California.  While there, he earned the nickname ""the Wizard of Menlo Park"".Walsh, Bryan. [http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1910417_1910419_1910460,00.html ""The Electrifying Edison""]. Web: Time 5 Jul 2010. It was in his Menlo Park laboratory that Thomas Edison invented both the phonograph and a commercially viable incandescent light bulb filament. Christie Street in Menlo Park was the first street in the world to use electric lights for illumination.  The Menlo Park lab has been called one of the greatest laboratories ever.  Edison left Menlo Park and moved his home and laboratory to West Orange in 1887.  After his death, the Thomas Alva Edison Memorial Tower and Museum was constructed near his old Menlo Park lab and dedicated in 1938. Edison's old lab site and memorial now make up Edison State Park.

American writer Edgar Allan Poe, the master of the macabre who died penniless 160 years ago after a mysterious death, finally got proper send off in Baltimore on Sunday.
American writer Edgar Allan Poe, the master of the macabre who died penniless 160 years ago after a mysterious death, finally got proper send off in Baltimore on Sunday.
An elaborate funeral service was organised for Poe whose original funeral was attended by only seven people.
The cause of his death remains unknown although some theories suggest it was alcohol-related. The author of works like The Raven and the The Black Cat was found in a confused state on the streets of Baltimore in October 1849 and died in a city hospital a few days later at the age of 40.
A life-size replica of Poe's body went on display in a pine casket at the Poe House in Baltimore on October 7 for visitors to pay their respects, according to Jeff Jerome, curator of the Poe Museum.
""This actually is the bicentennial of Poe's birth and there was very little we could do with the birth so we thought we would recreate Poe's funeral since his original funeral was very quick. There were only seven people in attendance,"" Jerome told Reuters Television.
""I thought this would be Baltimore's chance to make it right, to do it the right way.""
The casket was loaded onto an old fashioned hearse and taken through the city to Westminster Burying Ground where the writer is buried.
Many Poe fans gathered to bid a proper farewell to the writer whose life had been a struggle as he made very little money from his writing.
Many dressed in period costumes to join the funeral procession, some dressed as famous people who had either known Poe or had been inspired by him, such as Walt Whitman, Charles Baudelaire, and Alfred Hitchcock.
""Personally Edgar Allan Poe has meant so much to me as far as his creativity and originality so it is great to be here. It's a privilege to be here and honour him,"" said one Poe fan, Roger Bow, who had come from New York for the event.

This is Calling All Workers composed by Eric Coates and performed by Eric Coates and his Symphony Orchestra, this tune is the well known theme to the long running BBC radio programme Music while you work.
Music While You Work was a daytime music programme broadcast twice daily in the United Kingdom on the BBC General Forces Programme. It began broadcasting in June 1940 during World War II, with the intention of helping the war effort. It was perceived that the productivity of manual labour could be raised by offering a non-stop medley of popular music played at an even tempo, to accompany the working day in factories. For a certain period, a recorded version was rebroadcast in the late evening, to entertain night-shift workers. After the war, the broadcasts continued on the newly-formed BBC Light Programme.
Music While You Work was discontinued in 1967 when most Light Programme offerings were transitioned to BBC Radio 2. However, it was revived in the 1980s; initially for one week to mark the BBC's 60th anniversary in October 1982 and then as a regular part of the Radio 2 schedules from January 1983 to January 1984

Passage:
Phlebitis
Phlebitis or venitis is the inflammation of a vein, usually in the legs. It most commonly occurs in superficial veins. Phlebitis often occurs in conjunction with thrombosis and is then called ""thrombophlebitis"" or ""superficial thrombophlebitis"". Unlike deep vein thrombosis, the probability that superficial thrombophlebitis will cause a clot to break up and be transported in pieces to the lung is very low. 

Signs and symptoms

* Localized redness and swelling
* Pain or burning along the length of the vein 
* Vein being hard and cord-like 

Cause

Phlebitis is typically caused by local trauma to a vein, usually from the insertion of an intravenous catheter.  However, phlebitis can also occur due to a complication of connective tissue disorders such as lupus, or of pancreatic, breast, or ovarian cancers. Phlebitis can also result from certain medications and drugs that irritate the veins, such as desomorphine. 

Superficial phlebitis often presents as an early sign in thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease), a vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized arteries and veins in distal extremities often associated with cigarette smoking. 

Management

Treatment usually consists of NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and local compression (e.g., by compression stockings or a compress).  If the phlebitis is associated with local bacterial infection, antibiotics may be used. 

For acute infusion superficial thrombophlebitis there is not enough evidence as of 2015 to determine treatment. 

History

Phlebitis was first described by John Hunter in 1784.
Question:
What specific part of the body is affected by phlebitis?
Answer:
Vein valves

Three-time Tour de France champion Greg LeMond discusses the effects of drug doping on professional cycling.
----
Ethics, Doping, and the Future of Cycling with cyclist Greg LeMond.
Greg LeMond has long been a critic of doping in cycling. During 2007, he played an unexpected role in the international arbitration hearing that eventually decided American cyclist Floyd Landis should forfeit his 2006 Tour de France title due to testing that found abnormally high levels of testosterone. LeMond testified that he had spoken with Landis after his ""A"" urine sample had tested positive, urging him that if his ""B"" sample was also positive, he should come clean, help his sport, and ""more importantly, help himself."" Before his testimony, LeMond had been threatened by Landis' manager.
The doping problem has been most public in the Tour de France - two stage winners of the 2007 Tour withdrew from the race amid doping allegations - but its influence is so pervasive that T-Mobile recently withdrew its sponsorship of a professional cycling team, stating that the company did not want to associate its brand with doping. - Santa Clara University
Greg LeMond is a former professional road bicycle racer from the United States and a three time winner of the Tour de France in 1986, 1989, and 1990.

Passage:
Piculet
The piculets are a distinctive subfamily of small woodpeckers which occur mainly in tropical South America, with just three Asian and one African  species.

Like the true woodpeckers, piculets have large heads, long tongues which they use to extract their insect prey and zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backwards. However, but they lack the stiff tail feathers that the true woodpeckers use when climbing trees, so they are more likely than their relatives to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk.

Their bills are shorter and less dagger-like than  the true woodpeckers, so they look for insects and grubs mainly in decaying wood. Similarly, they re-use woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters.

Typically these birds have grey or dull green upperparts and dark-streaked white underparts.

Systematics and evolution

Although not well known from fossils, the evolution of piculets is now considered rather straightforward. The disjunct occurrence of the genera, with one African species of the Southeast Asian Sasia and one Southeast Asian species of the American Picumnus is of comparatively recent origin. Molecular dating, calibrated with geographic events in the absence of a good fossil record, points at the Late Miocene, c. 8 MYA, as the point where the two genera divided into their two respective lineages. At that time, there was a notable global cooling period. The molecular distances between piculets and woodpeckers are comparatively small for subfamilies, agreeing with the hypothesis that the split between the three groups of woodpecker-like picids subfamilies occurred only during the Miocene climate optimum, around 15 MYA. The later radiation of South American piculets is probably due to changes in topology and climate fluctuations during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The genus Verreauxia may be accepted because of pronounced morphological similarities, but the two Picumnus lineages, despite having diverged long ago, are virtually alike except for head coloration (Fuchs et al., 2006).

The Antillean piculet (Nesoctites micromegas) has proven to be a very distinct species evolutionarily between piculets and woodpeckers (Benz et al., 2006) and thus is nowadays placed in a subfamily of its own.

The arrangement of species in the genera follows del Hoyo et al. (2002).

Genus Picumnus
* Speckled piculet,  Picumnus innominatus (sometimes Vivia)
* Bar-breasted piculet,  Picumnus aurifrons

Passage:
Loch Ness
Loch Ness (; ,) is a large, deep, freshwater loch in the Scottish Highlands extending for approximately 37 km southwest of Inverness. Its surface is 52 ft above sea level. Loch Ness is best known for alleged sightings of the cryptozoological Loch Ness Monster, also known affectionately as ""Nessie"". It is connected at the southern end by the River Oich and a section of the Caledonian Canal to Loch Oich. At the northern end there is the Bona Narrows which opens out into Loch Dochfour, which feeds the River Ness and a further section of canal to Inverness. It is one of a series of interconnected, murky bodies of water in Scotland; its water visibility is exceptionally low due to a high peat content in the surrounding soil.

Loch Ness is the second largest Scottish loch by surface area at 56 sqkm after Loch Lomond, but due to its great depth, it is the largest by volume in the British Isles. Its deepest point is 755 ft,   making it the second deepest loch in Scotland after Loch Morar. A 2016 survey claimed to have discovered a crevice that pushed the depth to 889 ft but further research determined it to be a sonar anomaly.    It contains more fresh water than all the lakes in England and Wales combined, and is the largest body of water on the Great Glen Fault, which runs from Inverness in the north to Fort William in the south.

Villages and places

At Drumnadrochit is the ""Loch Ness Centre and Exhibition""  which examines the natural history and legend of Loch Ness. Boat cruises operate from various locations on the loch shore, giving visitors the chance to look for the ""monster"".

Urquhart Castle is located on the western shore, 1 mi east of Drumnadrochit.

Lighthouses are located at Lochend (Bona Lighthouse) and Fort Augustus.

Monster

Loch Ness is thought by some to be the home of the Loch Ness Monster (also known as ""Nessie""), a cryptid, reputedly a large unknown animal. It is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, though its description varies from one account to the next. Popular interest and belief in the animal's existence has varied since it was first brought to the world's attention in 1933. 

Fish species

The following fish species are native to Loch Ness. A number of others such as perch and roach have been introduced in the Loch or Caledonian Canal with various levels of success. 

Island 

The only island on Loch Ness is Cherry Island, visible at its southwestern end, near Fort Augustus. It is a crannog, which is a form of artificial island. Most crannogs were constructed during the Iron Age.

There was formerly a second island (Dog Island) which was submerged when the water level was raised during the construction of the Caledonian Canal.

Hydroelectricity

Loch Ness serves as the lower storage reservoir for the Foyers pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme, which was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. The turbines were originally used to provide power for a nearby aluminium smelting plant, but now electricity is generated and supplied to the National Grid. Another scheme, the 100 MW Glendoe Hydro Scheme near Fort Augustus, began generation in June 2009 producing 76 gigawatt hours in its first months of operation, It was out of service between 2009 and 2012 for repair of the tunnels connecting the reservoir to the turbines 

Geology

Loch Ness lies along the Great Glen Fault, which forms a line of weakness in the rocks which has been excavated by glacial erosion, forming the Great Glen and the basins of Loch Lochy, Loch Oich and Loch Ness.

Loch Ness records

John Cobb died in an attempt at the water speed record when his boat Crusader struck an unexplained wake on the surface of the loch in 1952. His accident was recorded by the BBC reporters on site at the time.  Nearby, there is a memorial to him erected by the people of Glenurquhart

On 31 August 1974, David Scott Munro, of Ross-shire Caberfeidh Water Ski Club, became the first person in the world to water ski (mono ski) the length of Loch Ness. From Lochend to Fort Augustus and back, he covered the 48 miles in 77 minutes at an average speed of 37 mph. 

Brenda Sherratt was the first person to swim  along the length of Loch Ness in Scotland in 31 hours and 27 minutes in July 1966.

Passage:
Pishon
The Pishon ( Pîšōn) is one of four rivers (along with Hiddekel (Tigris), Phrath (Euphrates) and Gihon) mentioned in the Biblical Book of Genesis. In that passage, these rivers are described as arising within the Garden of Eden. The Pishon is described as encircling ""the entire land of Havilah."" 

Identification 

Unlike the Tigris and the Euphrates, the Pishon has never been clearly located. It is briefly mentioned together with the Tigris in the Wisdom of Sirach (24:25), but this reference throws no more light on the location of the river. The Jewish-Roman historian Flavius Josephus, in the beginning of his Antiquities of the Jews (1st century AD) identified the Pishon with the Ganges.  The medieval French rabbi Rashi identified it with the Nile.

Some early modern scholars, including A.D. Calumet (1672–1757), Rosenmüller (1768–1835), and Kell (1807–1888), believed the source river [for Eden] was a region of springs: ""The Pishon and Gihon were mountain streams.  The former may have been the Phasis or Araxes, and the latter the Oxus."" 
James A. Sauer, former curator of the Harvard Semitic Museum, made an argument from geology and history that Pishon referred to what is now the Wadi Bisha, a dry channel which begins in the Hijaz Mountains near Medina to run northeast to Kuwait.  With the aid of satellite photos, Farouk El-Baz of Boston University traced the dry channel from Kuwait up the Wadi Al-Batin and the Wadi Al-Rummah system originating near Medina. 

David Rohl identified Pishon with the Uizhun, placing Havilah to the northeast of Mesopotamia. The Uizhun is known locally as the Golden River. Rising near Mt. Sahand, it meanders between ancient gold mines and lodes of lapis lazuli before feeding the Caspian Sea. Such natural resources correspond to the ones associated with the land of Havilah in Genesis.
Question:
According to the Old Testament, which place is the source of the river that divides into four other rivers - the Pishon, Gihon, Tigris and Euphrates?

Eden (Bible)

The charity provides support for pet owners who cannot afford private veterinary treatment, helps to find homes for unwanted animals, and educates the public in the responsibilities of animal ownership.

The charity works closely with a number of other organizations to promote animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.

History

The organisation was founded on 10 May 1897 in London as Our Dumb Friends League, to care for working horses on the streets of the British capital.  It opened its first animal hospital, in Victoria, London, on 15 May 1906.

In 1912, the league launched The Blue Cross Fund to care for horses during the Balkan War. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, it was quickly reopened again. By the armistice in 1918, the Blue Cross Fund had raised nearly £170,000 – the equivalent of almost £6.5 million today – to care for the animals of conflict. Over 50,000 horses were treated in Blue Cross hospitals in France, and the charity had sent vital veterinary supplies to 3,500 units of the British Army. 

Donations to the Fund enabled the charity to care for more than 350,000 animals during the Second World War, many of who were wounded during the Blitz. 
The name of the appeal fund became more widely known than the official charity title and the league officially changed its name to ""The Blue Cross"" in 1950. In 2011 the charity dropped ""The"" from its name and is now simply known as ""Blue Cross.""

Sally de la Bedoyere became the charity’s CEO in November 2014. 

Operations

Blue Cross operates a number of services throughout the United Kingdom.  Its major services are: rehoming unwanted animals, providing veterinary services to pet owners who cannot afford the private fees charged by private veterinary surgeons, promoting animal welfare through education, and operating the Pet Bereavement Support Service, a free and confidential support line for those who have lost a pet.  They also operate a horse ambulance service, including at large equestrian events.

Blue Cross operates four animal hospitals, three of which are in London, at Victoria, Merton and Hammersmith, and a fourth in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, as well as running mobile clinics throughout the country. In 2014 it opened a pet care clinic in Derby.   Blue Cross carried out over 97,000 treatments, operations and diagnostic investigations in 2010.

Blue Cross is also heavily involved in animal adoption, arranging adoption for companion animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits and small rodents, as well as larger species such as horses.   In 2013, the charity rehomed 8,191 animals. 

The organisation also works to improve the lives of animals through promotion to pet owners and work in animal behaviour therapy. Every pet owner that rehomes a pet through the charity can benefit from free behaviour advice for the pet’s lifetime. The Pet Bereavement Support Service is available 365 days a year to help people who are struggling to cope with the loss of a pet.

Proposed closure of two animal centres

On 26 January 2010, Blue Cross announced the proposed closure of the two animal adoption centres (Felixstowe and Northiam, East Sussex), both of which had been in existence for over 50 years. Final decisions on both sites were announced on 4 May 2010. After an extensive publicity campaign by locals, it was announced that plans to close the Felixstowe centre had been dropped.  The centre will relocate to a brand new site near Ipswich. Work on the purpose-built rehoming centre is due to begin in 2014. 

Partnerships

The Irish Blue Cross is a related party of Blue Cross.

Awards

Medals have been awarded by Blue Cross to animals and people who have demonstrated bravery or heroism. While the first medals were awarded to people who helped to rescue animals, medals were awarded in 1918 to honour a number of horses which had served in the First World War. Medals were then given out between 1940 and 1951 to a number of dogs, including Juliana who reportedly extinguished an incendiary bomb by urinating on it. In 2006 Jake, a police explosives dog, was given the honour after helping to clear out the London Underground after the 7 July 2005 London bombings.

Passage:
Kid Ory
Edward ""Kid"" Ory (December 25, 1886 – January 23, 1973) was a jazz trombonist and bandleader. He was born in Woodland Plantation near La Place, Louisiana.

Biography

Ory started playing music with home-made instruments in his childhood, and by his teens was leading a well-regarded band in Southeast Louisiana. He kept La Place, Louisiana, as his base of operations due to family obligations until his twenty-first birthday, when he moved his band to New Orleans, Louisiana. He was one of the most influential trombonists of early jazz.

Ory was a banjo player during his youth and it is said that his ability to play the banjo helped him develop ""tailgate"", a particular style of playing the trombone. In ""tailgate"" style the trombone plays a rhythmic line underneath the trumpets and cornets.

While Ory was living on Jackson Avenue, he was discovered by Buddy Bolden, playing his first New trombone, instead of the old civil war trombone. But his sister said he was too young to play with Bolden.

Ory had one of the best-known bands in New Orleans in the 1910s, hiring many of the great jazz musicians of the city, including cornetists Joe ""King"" Oliver, Mutt Carey, and Louis Armstrong, who joined the band in 1919;  and clarinetists Johnny Dodds and Jimmie Noone.

In 1919 he moved to Los Angeles—one of a number of New Orleans musicians to do so near that time—and he recorded there in 1921 with a band that included Mutt Carey, clarinetist and pianist Dink Johnson, and string bassist Ed Garland. Garland and Carey were longtime associates who would still be playing with Ory during his 1940s comeback. While in Los Angeles Ory and his band recorded two instrumentals, ""Ory's Creole Trombone"" and ""Society Blues"", as well as a number of songs. They were the first jazz recordings made on the west coast by an African-American jazz band from New Orleans. His band recorded with the recording company Nordskog and Ory paid them for the pressings and then sold them under his own label of ""Kid Ory's Sunshine Orchestra"" at a store in Los Angeles called Spikes Brothers Music Store. In 1925, Ory moved to Chicago, where he was very active, working and recording with Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and many others. He mentored Benny Goodman, and later Charles Mingus.

During the Great Depression Ory retired from music and did not play again until 1943. From 1944 to about 1961 he led one of the top New Orleans style bands of the period. In addition to Mutt Carey and Ed Garland, trumpeters Alvin Alcorn and Teddy Buckner; clarinetists Darnell Howard, Jimmie Noone, Albert Nicholas, Barney Bigard, and George Probert; pianists Buster Wilson, Cedric Haywood, and Don Ewell; and drummer Minor Hall were among his sidemen during this period. All but Probert, Buckner, and Ewell were originally from New Orleans.

The Ory band was an important force in reviving interest in New Orleans jazz, making popular 1940s radio broadcasts—among them a number of slots on The Orson Welles Almanac program (beginning March 15, 1944).    In 1944–45 the group made a series of recordings on the Crescent Records label, founded by Nesuhi Ertegun for the express purpose of recording Ory's band. 

During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Ory and his group appeared at the Beverly Cavern in Los Angeles.

Ory retired from music in 1966 and spent his last years in Hawaii, with the assistance of Trummy Young. Ory died in Honolulu. He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

Passage:
Pangram
A Pangram (, pan gramma, ""every letter"") or holoalphabetic sentence for a given alphabet is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. Pangrams have been used to display typefaces, test equipment, and develop skills in handwriting, calligraphy, and keyboarding.

The best known English pangram is ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."" It has been used since at least the late 19th century, was utilized by Western Union to test Telex / TWX data communication equipment for accuracy and reliability,  and is now used by a number of computer programs (most notably the font viewer built into Microsoft Windows) to display computer fonts. An example in another language is ', containing all letters used in German , including every umlaut (ä, ö, ü) plus the ß.  It has been used since before 1800.

Short pangrams in English are more difficult to come up with and tend to use uncommon words. A perfect pangram contains every letter of the alphabet only once and can be considered an anagram of the alphabet; it is the shortest possible pangram.  An example is the phrase ""Cwm fjord bank glyphs vext quiz"" (', a loan word from Welsh, means a steep-sided valley, particularly in Wales). However, such examples are not usually understood even by native English speakers, and so arguably are not really English pangrams. 

Here are some short pangrams using standard written English, not involving abbreviations or proper nouns:
# ""Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs."" (32 letters)
# ""Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz."" (31 letters)
# ""The five boxing wizards jump quickly."" (31 letters)
# ""How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!"" (30 letters)
# ""Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack."" (29 letters)

Longer pangrams may afford more opportunity for humor, cleverness, or thoughtfulness.   

In a sense, the pangram is the opposite of the lipogram, in which the aim is to omit one or more letters.

Logographic scripts 

Logographic scripts, that is, writing systems composed principally of logograms, cannot be used to produce pangrams in the literal sense, since they are radically different from alphabets or other phonetic writing systems. In such scripts, the total number of signs is large and imprecisely defined, so producing a text with every possible sign is impossible. However, various analogies to pangrams are feasible, including traditional pangrams in a romanization. In Japanese, although typical orthography uses kanji (logograms), pangrams are required to contain every kana (syllabic character) when written out in kana alone: the Iroha is a classic example.

In addition, it is possible to create pangrams that demonstrate certain aspects of logographic characters.

In Chinese, the Thousand Character Classic is a 1000-character poem in which each character is used exactly once; however, it does not include all Chinese characters. The single character  (permanence) incorporates every basic stroke used to write Chinese characters exactly once, as described in the Eight Principles of Yong.

Self-enumerating pangrams 

A self-enumerating pangram is a pangrammatic autogram, or a sentence that inventories its own letters, each of which occurs at least once. The first example was produced by Rudy Kousbroek, a Dutch journalist and essayist, who publicly challenged Lee Sallows, a British recreational mathematician resident in the Netherlands, to produce an English translation of his Dutch pangram. In the sequel, Sallows built an electronic ""pangram machine"", that performed a  systematic search among millions of candidate solutions. The machine was successful in identifying the following 'magic' translation:   
This pangram contains four As, one B, two Cs, one D, thirty Es, six Fs, five Gs, seven Hs, eleven Is, one J, one K, two Ls, two Ms, eighteen Ns, fifteen Os, two Ps, one Q, five Rs, twenty-seven Ss, eighteen Ts, two Us, seven Vs, eight Ws, two Xs, three Ys, & one Z.

Chris Patuzzo, a British computer scientist was able to reduce the problem of finding a self-enumerating pangram to the Boolean satisfiability problem. He did this by using a bespoke Hardware description language as a stepping stone and then applied the Tseitin transformation to the resulting chip. 

Pangrams in literature

The pangram ""The quick brown fox..."" and searches for a shorter pangram are the cornerstone of the plot of the novel Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn.  The search successfully comes to an end when the phrase ""Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs"" is discovered.

SWOT Analysis for Goal Setting
SWOT, which stands for Strengths,     Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats, is a way to     analyze and evaluate your current situation and environment. While     it's typically used for strategic planning in business settings, it can also     be used in goal setting to help you identify goals that will give     you the most benefit. It is a way of matching your internal     capabilities, resources and liabilities with the external factors     you are facing.
SWOT analysis works best when focused on a     particular result area .
Performing a SWOT Analysis
You start by identifying your strengths,     which represent your internal capabilities and resources in this     result area. Here are some questions you can use to help you get     started:
What are your core competencies in this area?
What relevant skills, talents or abilities do      you poses?
What resources do you have at your disposal?
What specialized knowledge or expertise do you have access      to?
Who can you ask for advice, support or help?
What special/proprietary tools can you use or develop?
What is already working well in this area? What      related strengths does that reveal?
Keep in mind that not all of these questions will     apply to every result area. Just use the ones that make sense to     help you identify your strengths.
A SWOT analysis is essential for any goal in a              business. If you ever plan to run your own business, consider a              Business Administration degree from Anna Maria College online to learn how to do properly prepare a SWOT analysis.
The next step is to identify your weaknesses,     which represent your internal liabilities. In many cases, the lack of a     strength or resource can be considered a weakness. Here are some     ideas to help you identify your weaknesses:
What are your main liabilities in this area?
List all the relevant skills, abilities and      talents that you would find helpful in this result area. Which      ones are you the least good or proficient at?
List the specialized knowledge or expertise that      you would find helpful in this result area. Any knowledge or      expertise that you lack could be considered a weakness.
Are there any resources (money, time, help) that      you currently don't have access to?
What is not working in this area right now? What      related weaknesses does that reveal?
Your strengths and weaknesses give you     an idea of your internal capabilities, resources and liabilities.     The next step in SWOT analysis is to identify your external opportunities for profit, growth and improvement. Here are some     ideas to help you identify them:
List the opportunities that you have been      considering.
What things could you improve in this result      area?
Think of one thing you could do that would      significantly improve your situation in this area.
What important goals could you pursue?
How can you take advantage of your strengths?
Can you take advantage of any changes in your      environment or circumstances?
What opportunities would become available to you      if you eliminate some of your weaknesses?
Now identify your threats, which represent     external events, environmental factors, or changes that could affect     you negatively. Here are some ideas to help you identify some     threats:
Make a list of serious risks you are facing in      this area if you continue along your current path.
What obstacles or roadblocks are impeding your      progress?
What environmental factors are affecting you      negatively?
Think about how current changes to your      environment or circumstances could affect you negatively.
Using SWOT Analysis to Identify Targets and     Strategies
The whole point of doing a SWOT analysis is to help     you identify the most beneficial targets and strategies to pursue     right now based on your current situation, and to identify     strategies that will help you prepare for the future.
You do this by analyzing the four quadrants of the     SWOT matrix.
SWOT Quadrant I - Strengths/Opportunities (SO)
This quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     take advantage of your core strengths to aggressively pursue the     best opportunities at your disposal. This is particularly important     if the opportunities are short-lived. An example would be to utilize     a temporary competitive advantage to gain market share in your     business.
SWOT Quadrant II - Strengths/Threats (ST)
This quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     utilize your strengths to actively eliminate or reduce threats you     are facing.
SWOT Quadrant III-Weaknesses/Opportunities (WO)
This quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     can help you open up opportunities down the road by working to     reduce some of your weaknesses (or making your strengths even     stronger). You can use this quadrant to help you prepare a long-term     improvement plan.
SWOT Quadrant IV - Weaknesses/Threats (WT)
This quadrant focuses on goals and strategies that     can help you mitigate and avoid threats that could result from your     weaknesses. You could do this by eliminating the weaknesses and     turning them into strengths, or by developing defensive strategies     to reduce the likelihood or severity of the threat.
Summary
The four SWOT quadrants provide different     perspectives to help you identify targets and strategies:
SO Quadrant - Opportunities to Pursue
ST Quadrant - Threats to Eliminate
WO Quadrant - Things to Improve
WT Quadrant - Risk Mitigation & Avoidance
Over the long term, you should include goals from     each of the four quadrants for balance. In the short term, you may     want to focus on one or two quadrants to take advantage of any     circumstances you are currently facing.
Successes/Failures Analysis
While SWOT analysis is a good way to examine you     current situation looking forward, it doesn't always reveal past     trends that you can learn from. A successes/failures analysis     complements the SWOT matrix and can give you more insight into your     strengths and weaknesses.
You start by listing all your successes and     achievements in this result area, followed by listing all your     failures or missteps. Once you've listed them, you can identify     additional strengths and weaknesses based on the trends that they     show you.
Question:
In SWOT analysis used in business, for what does the 'S' stand?
Answer:
STRENGTHS, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats
Passage:
Endothermic process
The term endothermic process describes a process or reaction in which the system absorbs energy from its surroundings; usually, but not always, in the form of heat. The term was coined by Marcellin Berthelot from the Greek roots endo-, derived from the word ""endon"" (ἔνδον) meaning ""within"" and the root ""therm"" (θερμ-) meaning ""hot."" The intended sense is that of a reaction that depends on absorbing heat if it is to proceed. The opposite of an  endothermic process is an exothermic process, one that releases, ""gives out"" energy in the form of (usually, but not always) heat. Thus in each term (endothermic & exothermic) the prefix refers to where heat goes as the reaction occurs, though in reality it only refers to where the energy goes, without necessarily being in the form of heat.

The concept is frequently applied in physical sciences to, for example, chemical reactions, where thermal energy (heat) is converted to chemical bond energy.

Endothermic (and exothermic) analysis only accounts for the enthalpy change (∆H) of a reaction. The full energy analysis of a reaction is the Gibbs free energy (∆G), which includes an entropy (∆S) and temperature term in addition to the enthalpy. A reaction will be a spontaneous process at a certain temperature if the products have a lower Gibbs free energy (an exergonic reaction) even if the enthalpy of the products is higher. Entropy and enthalpy are different terms, so the change in entropic energy can overcome an opposite change in enthalpic energy and make an endothermic reaction favorable.

Examples

* Photosynthesis
* Melting ice
* Evaporating liquid water
* Sublimation of carbon dioxide (dry ice)
* Cracking of alkanes
* Thermal decomposition reactions
* Electrolytic decomposition of sodium chloride into sodium hydroxide and hydrogen chloride 
* Dissolving ammonium chloride in water
* Nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than nickel in stellar cores
* High-energy neutrons can produce tritium from lithium-7 in an endothermic reaction, consuming 2.466 MeV. This was discovered when the 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear test produced an unexpectedly high yield.

* Nuclear fusion of elements heavier than iron in supernovae
Question:
What is absorbed in an endothermic reaction?
Answer:
Heat as energy
Passage:
Belgrade Theatre
The Belgrade Theatre is a live performance venue seating 858 and situated in Coventry, England. It was the first civic theatre to be built after the Second World War in Britain and as such was more than a place of entertainment. It joined the new Coventry Cathedral as a symbol of optimism and culture in one of the largest re-development projects then undertaken, to rebuild the city of Coventry, which had been almost totally destroyed by bombing. The building is now a grade II listed building. In 1963 the Belgrade was registered as a charity by the Charity Commission (number 219163). 
The Belgrade acquired its name in recognition and thanks for a gift of timber from the Yugoslavian (today Serbian) capital city of Belgrade (Coventry's official sister city), that was used extensively in the construction of the auditorium. Since opening in 1958, the theatre has established itself as a centre for the new and innovative productions.

Having pioneered the Theatre-in-Education movement in the 1960s the theatre continues to work with disadvantaged young people and uses drama as a tool to develop personal and social skills. Their most successful programme ""Acting Out"" has been commissioned by Coventry's LEA for the last 10 years and has been replicated across the UK. One graduate of the course credits ""Acting Out"" with saving her life. 

The theatre reopened in September 2007 after undergoing a £12 million refurbishment with a 7-storey extension to provide a second auditorium.

Prince Edward officially opened the refurbishment of the Belgrade's B2 studio on 5 February 2008, this also marked the 50th anniversary of the Belgrade's opening performed by Princess Alexandra.
Question:
In which English city did the Belgrade Theatre open in 1958?
Answer:
Cofantre
Passage:
Something Rotten
Something Rotten is the fourth
book in the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde.  It continues the story some two years after the point where The Well of Lost Plots leaves off.

Plot introduction

The book sees Thursday return from the world of fiction to the alternative Swindon that Fforde introduced in The Eyre Affair; she is accompanied by Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, whose excursion from the world of fiction with Thursday forms the main sub-plot.

The title is taken from Hamlet I.iv:  ""Something is rotten in the State of Denmark"".

Plot summary

The story opens with Thursday still in the world of fiction in her job as the Bellman, head of the literary police force Jurisfiction. She is still hunting the Minotaur that escaped in the last book; she is tiring of fiction, however, and longs to return to her own world and get back her husband Landen, who was removed from time by the evil Goliath Corporation in 1947.  Despite Landen's non-existence, Thursday still has her son (Friday Next) who is now two years old.

Thursday and Friday return to her mother (Wednesday) in Swindon, with Hamlet who is accompanying them on an excursion to the ""Outland"" to find out what people in the real world think of him.  Her mother, whose main functions appear to be to make tea and to provide Battenberg cake, has some curious house guests:  Emma Hamilton, Otto von Bismarck, and a family of dodos.  Both humans are apparently staying for a rest, while Thursday's father (who has now been re-admitted to the time-travelling ChronoGuard) sorts out various parts of history for them.

Despite her earlier transgressions that caused her to flee to the Bookworld in the first place, Thursday gets her job back at SpecOps-27 as a Literary Detective and catches up with her old colleagues.  She learns that in her absence, Yorrick Kaine has joined forces with Goliath Corporation and plans to oust the ageing English President George Formby. As Prime Minister, Kaine wields some mysterious persuasive influence over Parliament and the people, and has used it to pass some bizarre laws and to stir up hatred of Denmark. Yorrick has also taken out a hit on her: he has hired an assassin known as ""The Windowmaker"", who is actually Cindy Stoker, the wife of Thursday's longtime friend, Spike.

Thursday's father warns her that Kaine's ambitions may cause nuclear armageddon and that it is up to her to stop him.  On top of this, she is visited by tearful agents from the Bookworld (Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and Emperor Zhark) who tell her that all sorts of things are going wrong without her leadership'; for starters, without its titular character, the play Hamlet has merged with The Merry Wives of Windsor creating a new play called ""The Merry Wives of Elsinore"", which is not nearly as good as either original play (in the words of Emperor Zhark, ""it takes a long time to get funny, and, when it finally does, everyone dies"").  Meanwhile, her most pressing problem is finding reliable childcare for Friday.

Goliath Corporation have decided to become the new world religion to avoid a prophecy (the prophecy states that the Goliath Corporation will fall; Goliath believes that converting itself into a religion will exempt it from destruction, as the prophecy specifies a business). Thursday meets the CEO—at their headquarters in the Isle of Man—and gets a promise that they will un-eradicate Landen in exchange for her forgiveness.  Thursday feels duped when she finds that, through some form of mind control, she has formally forgiven them, even though there is no sign of her husband.  Then suddenly he is back, but takes a while to stabilise. Thursday must wait patiently for his un-eradication to ""stick"". In the meantime, she embarks on several seemingly impossible tasks, which include smuggling ten truckloads of banned Danish literature into Wales, tracking down an illegal clone of William Shakespeare, and teaching Friday to speak properly.

On top of all of this, Thursday still has to help the Swindon Mallets win the 1988 Croquet Superhoop final to thwart Kaine and Goliath and avoid the impending end of the world (as foretold by the aforementioned prophecy).

She succeeds but not without a near-death experience and a visit to the gateway to the Underworld (which turns out to be a planned-but-never-built service station on the M4 motorway). The final chapters contain some curious time paradoxes in which Thursday finds that she has met herself at several other stages in her own lifespan, including one character which had seemed to be an independent character.

George H. W. Bush
George H. W. Bush, as the 41st President (1989-1993), brought to the White House a dedication to traditional American values and a determination to direct them toward making the United States ""a kinder and gentler nation"" in the face of a dramatically changing world.
George Bush brought to the White House a dedication to traditional American values and a determination to direct them toward making the United States ""a kinder and gentler nation."" In his Inaugural Address he pledged in ""a moment rich with promise"" to use American strength as ""a force for good.""
Coming from a family with a tradition of public service, George Herbert Walker Bush felt the responsibility to make his contribution both in time of war and in peace. Born in Milton, Massachusetts, on June 12, 1924, he became a student leader at Phillips Academy in Andover. On his 18th birthday he enlisted in the armed forces. The youngest pilot in the Navy when he received his wings, he flew 58 combat missions during World War II. On one mission over the Pacific as a torpedo bomber pilot he was shot down by Japanese antiaircraft fire and was rescued from the water by a U. S. submarine. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery in action.
Bush next turned his energies toward completing his education and raising a family. In January 1945 he married Barbara Pierce. They had six children-- George, Robin (who died as a child), John (known as Jeb), Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy.
At Yale University he excelled both in sports and in his studies; he was captain of the baseball team and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. After graduation Bush embarked on a career in the oil industry of West Texas.
Like his father, Prescott Bush, who was elected a Senator from Connecticut in 1952, George became interested in public service and politics. He served two terms as a Representative to Congress from Texas. Twice he ran unsuccessfully for the Senate. Then he was appointed to a series of high-level positions: Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Chief of the U. S. Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
In 1980 Bush campaigned for the Republican nomination for President. He lost, but was chosen as a running mate by Ronald Reagan. As Vice President, Bush had responsibility in several domestic areas, including Federal deregulation and anti-drug programs, and visited scores of foreign countries. In 1988 Bush won the Republican nomination for President and, with Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate, he defeated Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in the general election.
Bush faced a dramatically changing world, as the Cold War ended after 40 bitter years, the Communist empire broke up, and the Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union ceased to exist; and reformist President Mikhail Gorbachev, whom Bush had supported, resigned. While Bush hailed the march of democracy, he insisted on restraint in U. S. policy toward the group of new nations.
In other areas of foreign policy, President Bush sent American troops into Panama to overthrow the corrupt regime of General Manuel Noriega, who was threatening the security of the canal and the Americans living there. Noriega was brought to the United States for trial as a drug trafficker.
Bush's greatest test came when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, then threatened to move into Saudi Arabia. Vowing to free Kuwait, Bush rallied the United Nations, the U. S. people, and Congress and sent 425,000 American troops. They were joined by 118,000 troops from allied nations. After weeks of air and missile bombardment, the 100-hour land battle dubbed Desert Storm routed Iraq's million-man army.
Despite unprecedented popularity from this military and diplomatic triumph, Bush was unable to withstand discontent at home from a faltering economy, rising violence in inner cities, and continued high deficit spending. In 1992 he lost his bid for reelection to Democrat William Clinton.

Passage:
Hyde Park Corner
Hyde Park Corner is an area in London located around a major road junction at the southeastern corner of Hyde Park. Six streets converge at the junction: Park Lane (from the north), Piccadilly (northeast), Constitution Hill (southeast), Grosvenor Place (south), Grosvenor Crescent (southwest) and Knightsbridge (west).

Hyde Park Corner tube station, a London Underground station served by the Piccadilly line, is located at the junction as well as a number of notable monuments.

Immediately to the north of the junction is Apsley House, the home of the first Duke of Wellington, and several monuments to the Duke were erected in the vicinity in his lifetime and subsequently.

Evolution and development 

 
In the centre of the Hyde Park Corner traffic island stands the Wellington Arch (or Constitution Arch), designed by Decimus Burton and planned as a northern gate to the grounds of Buckingham Palace.  In execution, it was laid out as a gate into the Green Park and was originally sited directly opposite Burton's Ionic Screen (also known as the Hyde Park Corner Screen) which still provides a gate into Hyde Park.  Originally, the arch was topped with an equestrian statue of the Duke (by Matthew Cotes Wyatt).  

Because of traffic congestion, the arch was moved south and realigned to the axis of Constitution Hill in 1883. The boundary of Buckingham Palace's garden were moved south, and a new road named Duke of Wellington Place was created separating the space containing the arch from the rest of the Green Park. At this time the large equestrian statue was removed to Sandhurst.  It was subsequently replaced with the current work, entitled The Angel of Peace descending on the Quadriga of Victory, dated 1912, by the sculptor Adrian Jones. 

Following the passage of the Park Lane Improvement Act 1958, Park Lane was widened in the early 1960s.  For most of its length this was achieved by converting the former East Carriage Drive of Hyde Park into the northbund lanes of a dual carriageway, but at Hyde Park Corner, all lanes of traffic came together on a line immediately to the east of Apsley House that required demolition of houses on Piccadilly. This left Apsley House on an island site.  The InterContinental London hotel was subsequently built on the cleared site between the new route of Park Lane and Hamilton Place.

At part of the same scheme, a tunnel was constructed beneath the junction to allow traffic to flow freely between Knightsbridge and Piccadilly.   As a result, the area around the arch became a large traffic island, mostly laid to grass, and accessible only by pedestrian underpassess, and formally ceased to be part of the Green Park.

Subsequent changes to the road layout in the 1990s reinstated a route between Hyde Park and the Green Park for pedestrians, cyclists and horseriders using surface level crossings.

The traffic island includes a smaller equestrian statue of Wellington by Edgar Boehm unveiled in 1888, the Machine Gun Corps Memorial, the Royal Artillery Memorial, the Australian War Memorial and the New Zealand War Memorial. 

Other monuments in the vicinity of Hyde Park Corner include  Adrian Jones's Monument to the Cavalry of the Empire (off the west side of Park Lane),  Alexander Munro's Boy and Dolphin statue (in a rose garden parallel to Rotten Row, going west from Hyde Park Corner), the Queen Elizabeth Gate (behind Apsley House), the Wellington Monument (off the west side of Park Lane), and a statue of Lord Byron (on a traffic island opposite the Wellington Monument).

The term is often erroneously used for Speakers' Corner, which is located at the north-eastern corner of Hyde Park.

In popular culture

*The 1935 film Hyde Park Corner takes its name from the area, where it is set.
*""Hyde Park Corner"" was used as a codeword to announce to the government the death of King George VI in 1952.

Passage:
Accessory fruit
An accessory fruit (sometimes called false fruit, spurious fruit, pseudofruit, or pseudocarp) is a fruit in which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue exterior to the carpel.Esau, K. 1977. Anatomy of seed plants. John Wiley and Sons, New York. Examples of accessory tissue are the receptacle of the strawberry, pineapple, common fig, and mulberry, and the calyx of Gaultheria procumbens or Syzygium jambos. Pomes, such as apples and pears, are also accessory fruits, with much of the fruit flesh derived from a hypanthium.  Other example could be the anthocarps specific to the family Nyctaginaceae, where most of the fruit comes from the perianth (floral whorls).

Fruit with fleshy seeds, such as pomegranate or mamoncillo, are not considered to be accessory fruit.

The terms false fruit, spurious fruit, and pseudocarp are older terms for accessory fruit that have been criticized as ""inapt"", and are not used by botanists today.
Question:
Pseudocarp relates to which type of crop?
Answer:
Fruiting

Poe fans gathered to bid a proper farewell to the writer whose life had been a struggle as he made very little money from his writing. The author of works like The Raven and the The Black Cat was found in a confused state on the streets of Baltimore in October 1849 and died in a city hospital a few days later at the age of 40. A life-size replica of Poe's body went on display in a pine casket at the Poe House in Baltimore for visitors to pay their respects. The cause of his death remains unknown although some theories suggest it was alcohol-related. It was in his Menlo Park laboratory that Thomas Edison invented both the phonograph and a commercially viable incandescent light bulb filament. Edison's old lab site and memorial now make up Edison State Park in New Jersey, United States. The Thomas Alva Edison Memorial Tower and Museum was constructed near his old Menlo park lab and dedicated in 1938. It has been called one of the greatest laboratories ever. It is located in Edison Township in Middlesex County, New Jersey and is named after Edison, the inventor who set up his home and research laboratory in the area in 1876. In 1876, he earned the nickname ""the Wizard of Menlo. Park"" for his work at the lab, which at the time was the site of an unsuccessful real estate development named after the town of MenLo Park, California. The lab is now part of the Edison State. Park in West Orange, which is also home to the Thomas Edison Memorial tower and Museum, which was built in 1938 and dedicated to the inventor's work. The museum is located near the former home and laboratory of Thomas Edison, who moved to West Orange in 1887. The site is now home to a museum dedicated to Edison, whose home and lab was the first to use electric lights for illumination.

Loch Ness is a large, deep, freshwater loch in the Scottish Highlands extending for approximately 37 km southwest of Inverness. Loch Ness is best known for alleged sightings of the cryptozoological Loch Ness Monster, also known affectionately as ""Nessie"" It is the second largest Scottish loch by surface area at 56 sqkm after Loch Lomond, but due to its great depth, it is the largest by volume in the British Isles. It contains more fresh water than all the lakes in England and Wales combined. Boat cruises operate from various locations on the loch shore, giving visitors the chance to look for the ""monster"" The only island is Cherry Island, which was formerly a second island (Dog Island) which serves as a reservoir for the lower water level of the Caledonian Canal. It is one of a series of interconnected, murky bodies of water in Scotland; its water visibility is exceptionally low due to a high peat content in the surrounding soil. A 2016 survey claimed to have discovered a crevice that pushed the depth to 889 ft, but further research determined it to be a sonar anomaly. The following fish species are native to Loch Ness. A number of others have been introduced in the Loch or Caledonian Canal with various levels of success. There are also a number of other fish species that are not native to the Loch Ness area. A piculet is which type of creature? The answer is ""Avians"" and the animal's animal's name is ""Phenomenon"" The fish species and animal's species are also known as ""Fish"" and ""Fish"", and the fish's name may be changed to ""Loch"" or ""Cherry"" depending on the type of fish it is. A fish is a fish that lives in Loch Ness and is known as a ""piculet"" or a ""fish species"" The species of fish is ""Chenopteryx"" and its name means ""chenoptyx"" or  ""loch"" in Scottish Gaelic. The fish is thought by some to be the home of the Nessie, a cryptid, reputedly a large unknown animal. It was first brought to the world's attention in 1933, but its existence has varied from one account to the next. The Nessie is thought to be similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, though its description varies from one story to the other. The Loch Ness monster is believed to have been sighted on several occasions. Loch Ness lies along the Great Glen Fault, which forms a line of weakness in the rocks which has been excavated by glacial erosion. The Pishon (Pîšōn) is one of four rivers (along with Hiddekel (Tigris), Phrath (Euphrates) and Gihon) mentioned in the Biblical Book of Genesis. In that passage, these rivers are described as arising within the Garden of Eden. It is briefly mentioned together with the Tigris in the Wisdom of Sirach (24:25), but this reference throws no more light on the location of the river. The first person to swim along the length of Loch Ness in Scotland in July 1966 was Brenda Sherratt. David Scott Munro, of Ross-shire Caberfeidh Water Ski Club, became the first person in the world to water ski (mono ski) the length  the loch in 1974. The 100 MW Glendoe Hydro Scheme near Fort Augustus, began generation in June 2009 producing 76 gigawatt hours in its first months of operation, It was out of service between 2009 and 2012 for repair of the tunnels connecting the reservoir to the turbines.

The organisation was founded on 10 May 1897 in London as Our Dumb Friends League. It opened its first animal hospital, in Victoria, London, on 15 May 1906. In 1912, the league launched The Blue Cross Fund to care for horses during the Balkan War. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, it was quickly reopened again. In 2011 the charity dropped ""The"" from its name and is now simply known as ""Blue Cross"" Blue Cross operates four animal hospitals, three of which are in London, at Victoria, Merton and Hammersmith, and a fourth in Grimsby, Lincolnshire. They also operate a horse ambulance service, including at large equestrian events. In 2013, the charity rehomed 8,191 animals and carried out over 97,000 treatments, operations and diagnostic investigations in 2010. The Pet Bereavement Support Service is available 365 days a year to help people who are struggling to cope with the loss of a pet. In 2010, Blue Cross announced the proposed closure of the two animal adoption centres (Felixstowe and Northiam, East Sussex), both of which had been in existence for over 50 years. Final decisions on both sites were announced on 4 May 2010. After an extensive publicity campaign by locals,. it was announced that plans to close the Felixstowe centre had been dropped. The centre will relocate to a brand new site near Ipswich. Work on the purpose-built rehoming centre is due to begin in 2014. In 2006 Jake, a police explosives dog, was given the honour of helping to clear out the bomb site at Ipswich, after he urinated on it. The Irish Blue Cross is a related party of Blue Cross. The organisation also works to improve the lives of animals through promotion to pet owners and work in animal behaviour therapy. It is also heavily involved in animal adoption, arranging adoption for companion animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits and small rodents, as well as larger species such as horses. The charity works closely with a number of other organizations to promote animal welfare and responsible pet ownership, and educates the public in the responsibilities of animal ownership. Edward ""Kid"" Ory (December 25, 1886 – January 23, 1973) was a jazz trombonist and bandleader. Ory started playing music with home-made instruments in his childhood, and by his teens was leading a well-regarded band in Southeast Louisiana. He was a banjo player during his youth and it is said that his ability to play the banjo helped him develop ""tailgate"", a particular style of playing the trombone. He mentored Benny Goodman, and later Charles Mingus. He retired from music in 1966 and spent his last years in Hawaii with the assistance of the Trummy Young Young Trummy Foundation. He died at Holy Cross Cemetery in Honolulu in 1973 and was buried at Red Allen Cemetery in Culver City, California. He is survived by his wife, two daughters, and a son. He had a son and a daughter-in-law, both of whom are jazz musicians. He also had two step-daughters, one of whom is a jazz pianist and the other is a singer-songwriter. The Ory band was an important force in reviving interest in New Orleans jazz, making popular 1940s radio broadcasts. It made a number of slots on The Orson Welles Almanac program (beginning March 15, 1944) In 1944–45 the group made a series of recordings on the Crescent Records label, founded by Nesuhi Ertegun for the express purpose of recording Ory's band. The band recorded two instrumentals, ""Ory's Creole Trombone"" and ""Society Blues"", as well as anumber of songs. They were the first jazz recordings made on the west coast by an African-American jazz band from New Orleans. The group recorded with the recording company Nordskog and Ory paid them for the pressings and then sold them under his own label of ""Kid Ory’s Sunshine Orchestra"" at a store in Los Angeles called Spikes Brothers Music Store. In 1925, Ory moved to Chicago, where he was very active, working and recording with Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and many others. He recorded in 1921 with a band that included Mutt Carey, clarinetist and pianist Dink Johnson, and string bassist Ed Garland. In 1922, he recorded in Chicago with a group that included Alvin Alcorn, Teddy Buckner, Albert Nicholas, Barney Bigard, and George Probert.

The pangram is the opposite of the lipogram, in which the aim is to omit one or more letters. Longer pangrams may afford more opportunity for humor, cleverness, or thoughtfulness. It is a way to analyze and evaluate your current situation. It's typically used for strategic planning in business settings. It can also be used in goal setting to help you identify goals that will give you the most benefit. The first example was produced by Rudy Kousbroek, a Dutch journalist and essayist, who publicly challenged Lee Sallows, a British recreational mathematician resident in the Netherlands, to produce an English translation. The search successfully comes to an end when the phrase ""Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs"" is discovered. Pangrams in literature are the cornerstone of the plot of the novel Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn. The phrase ""The quick brown fox..."" and searches for a shorter pangRam are the central themes of the book, which is published by Simon & Schuster at £9.99 (US$14.99) and £15 (UK) in hardback and e-book versions. The panggram is used to identify the most important people in the book. The book is also available in paperback and hardback, priced between £7.99 and £12.99, and can be pre-ordered at Amazon.com for £8.99 ($11.99), £10.99 for £12, and £13.50 for £15.99.

A SWOT analysis is a way of matching your internal capabilities, resources and liabilities with the external factors you are facing. SWOT Analysis works best when focused on a particular result area. If you ever plan to run your own business, consider a Business Administration degree from Anna Maria College online to learn how to do properly prepare a SWOTAnalysis. The whole point of doing a SWot analysis is to help you identify the most beneficial targets and strategies to pursue. Based on your current situation, you do the four quadrants of the SWOT matrix. I - Strengths/Opportunities (SO SWOT Quadrant I) I - Opportunities/Strategies (SO SWOT Quadrants I - II) II - Threats/Challenges (SO SO SWOT quadrant II) III - Threat/Challenge (SOSO SWot Quadrant III) IV - Threat / Challenge (SOSWot quadrant IV) V - Threat  Challenge  Challenge (SWSW Quadrant V)    V - Challenge / Challenge / Question (SWOT Quotient: ""How can you take advantage of your core strengths to pursue the best opportunities at your disposal?""   ""What are your core competencies in this area?""  ""Which skills, talents or abilities do you poses? ""What special knowledge or expertise do you have access to?"" ""Which special/proprietary tools can you use or develop?"" ""What is already working well in  this area? What is not working well? ""Which threats do you face?""  ""What external events, environmental factors are affecting you negatively?""  ""Which threats are you facing?""  ""Which opportunities do you think you can exploit most effectively? ""How do you use your strengths to make the most of your opportunities?""    ""What can you do to improve your situation in this result area?     What are your weaknesses?    What do you need to do to get the most out of your resources, time, money, and expertise? ""Who can you ask for advice, support or help? "" ""What opportunities are available to you that you can use to make your business a success?"" ""How will you use this information to help your business grow and succeed?"" "" What can you give back to the community that has helped you in the past?"" ""Who do you want to share your knowledge and skills with?"" The four SWOT quadrants provide different perspectives to help you identify targets and strategies. In the short term, you may want to focus on one or two quadrants to take advantage of any circumstances you are currently facing. A successes/failures analysis complements the SWOT matrix and can give you more insight into your strengths and weaknesses. The term endothermic process describes a process or reaction in which the system absorbs energy from its surroundings; usually, but not always, in the form of heat. In each term (endothermic & exothermic) the prefix refers to where heat goes as the reaction occurs, though in reality it only refers toWhere the energy goes, without necessarily being in theForm of heat, in a reaction. The full energy analysis of a reaction is the Gibbs free energy (∆G), which includes an entropy term in addition to the enthalpy term. A reaction will be a spontaneous process at a certain temperature if the products have a higher Gibbs freeenergy. Enthalpy and entropic energy are different terms, so different terms can overcome an opposite energy and make an endotherm reaction more favorable.emporary competitive advantage to gain market share in your     business.

The Belgrade Theatre is a live performance venue in Coventry, England. It was the first civic theatre to be built after the Second World War in Britain. Since opening in 1958, the theatre has established itself as a centre for the new and innovative productions. It pioneered the Theatre-in-Education movement in the 1960s and uses drama as a tool to develop personal and social skills. Their most successful programme ""Acting Out"" has been commissioned by Coventry's LEA for the last 10 years and has been replicated across the UK. The book sees Thursday return from the world of fiction to the alternative Swindon that Fforde introduced in The Eyre Affair; she is accompanied by Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. Thursday and Friday return to her mother, with Hamlet accompanying them on an excursion to the ""Outland"" to find out what people in the real world think of him. The title is taken from Hamlet I:  ""Something is rotten in the State of Denmark"". It continues the story some two years after the point where The Well of Lost Plots leaves off. Thursday's father (who has now been re-admitted to the time-travelling Chronoworld) sorts out history for them. Thursday gets her job back atOps-27 as a Literary Detectiis. Thursday is still in her job as the Bellman, head of the literary police force Jurisfiction. She is still hunting the Minotaur that escaped in the last book, but is tiring of fiction, and longs to get back her husband Landen, who was removed from time by the evil Goliath Corporation in 1947. Despite Landen's non-existence, Thursday still has her son (Friday Next) who is now two years old. Both humans are apparently staying for a rest, while Friday's father sorts out her earlier transgressions that caused her to flee in the first place, and Thursday gets to the first part of Spec-Guard. The story ends with Thursday's mother, whose main functions appear to be to make tea and to provide Battenberg cake, having some curious house guests: Emma Hamilton, Otto von Bismarck, and a family of dodos. George H. W. Bush, as the 41st President (1989-1993), brought to the White House a dedication to traditional American values and a determination to direct them toward making the United States ""a kinder and gentler nation"" Author Jasper Fforde says he was inspired by the characters of the Reading Thwackers and the Swindon Mallets in his book 'Something Rotten' The final chapters contain some curious time paradoxes in which Thursday finds that she has met herself at several other stages in her own lifespan, including one character which had seemed to be an independent character. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced at £16.99, and is available in hardback, paperback and e-book.

The traffic island includes a equestrian statue of Wellington, unveiled in 1888, the Royal Artillery Memorial Memorial, and the Royal Gun Corps Memorial, unveiled by Edgar Boehm in 1888. It also includes a number of notable monuments, including Apsley House, the home of the first Duke of Wellington and The Angel of Peace descending on the Quadriga of Victory, dated 1912, by the sculptor Adrian Jones. It is located at the junction of Park Lane, a London Underground station served by the Piccadilly line, and Grosvenor Crescent, a street in Knightsbridge, and Constitution Hill, the axis of the Wellington Arch. It was originally sited directly opposite Burton's Ionic Screen (also known as the Hyde Park Corner Screen) which still provides a gate into Hyde Park, but was moved south and realigned to Constitution Hill in 1883. In the centre of the traffic island stands the Wellington arch (or Constitution Arch), designed by Decimus Burton and planned as a northern gate to the grounds of Buckingham Palace. The arch was subsequently replaced with the current work, entitled The Angel Of Peace descending in 1912.

Q: Did Sammy Hagar do the song I CAN’T DRIVE 55 because he got stopped by the cops so many times?
A: The song was based on an incident that happened to Sammy while he was driving from Albany, New York to Lake Placid. According to Sammy himself, “I was in a rent-a-car that wouldn’t go much faster than 55 miles an hour…..cop stopped me for doing 62 on a four lane road when there was no one else in sight. Then the guy gave me a ticket. And he said, ‘We give tickets around here for over-60.’ and I said, ‘I can’t drive 55.’ I grabbed a paper and a pen, and I swear the guy was writing the ticket and I was writing the lyrics. I got to Lake Placid, I had a guitar set-up there. And I wrote that song there on the spot.” When the video aired on MTV it ticked off law enforcement across the country and they demanded equal TV time to show the dangers of driving fast. There is also a rumor that Hagar’s auto insurance was WAY high…$5,000 a month. I CAN’T DRIVE 55 peaked at #26 in the fall of 1984.

Fatted calf
Fatted calf is a metaphor or symbol of festive celebration and rejoicing for someone's long-awaited return. It derives from the parable of the prodigal son in the New Testament.  In biblical times, people would often keep at least one piece of livestock that was fed a special diet to fatten it up, thus making it more flavorsome when prepared as a meal.  Slaughtering this livestock was to be done on rare and special occasions.  Thus when the prodigal son returns, the father ""kills the fatted calf"" to show that the celebration is out of the ordinary.

In modern usage, ""killing the fatted calf"" can simply mean to celebrate in an exuberant manner, as used in the Elton John song ""Bennie and the Jets"".

Kingdom of the Algarve
The Kingdom of the Algarve (Portuguese: Reino do Algarve, from the Arabic Gharb al-Andalusغرب الأندلس), later the Kingdom of the Algarves (Portuguese: Reino dos Algarves), was a nominal kingdom within the Kingdom of Portugal.

It was the second dominion of the Portuguese Crown and supposedly a kingdom apart from Portugal, though in fact the Algarvian kingdom had no institutions, special privileges, or autonomy. 
In actuality, it was just an honorific title for the Algarve based on its history and was very similar to the rest of the Portuguese provinces. 

The title King of Silves was first used by Sancho I of Portugal after the first conquest of Silves in 1189. As this conquest did not take all of the Algarve, D. Sancho never used the title King of Portugal and the Algarve, but instead it was adopted by his grandson Afonso III of Portugal as a part of the titles and honours of the Portuguese Crown.

History

Reconquista

During the Reconquista, Portuguese and Castilian conquests went south, to take lands from the Muslims that they claimed as theirs. Portugal conquered and secured much of its southern borders during the reigns of King Sancho II of Portugal and King Afonso III of Portugal.

First conquest

In 1189, King Sancho I of Portugal conquered Silves, one of the most prosperous cities in Al-Andalus, aligned at the time with the Almohad Caliphate. Portuguese control over Silves would be short, with the Almohads conquering the city again in 1191 in a massive counter-attack led by Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur the Almohad Caliph in person.

The conquest of Algarve

With the decline of the Almohads, the southern taifa city-states united under a single Emir, Mûsâ Ibn Muhammad Ibn Nassir Ibn Mahfûz, former governor of Niebla, and known among the Christians as Aben Mafom.

Aben Mafom, King of Niebla and Emir of Algarve, trying to counter the achievements made by the Portuguese in their territories, declared vassalage to Alfonso X of Castile (who thus titled himself the King of the Algarve). Through his vassals, Alfonso X hoped to claim dominion over the Algarve not yet conquered by the Portuguese. 

The Emir's vow of vassalage to Castille however did not stop the knights of the Order of Santiago, under the command of the Grand-Master Paio Peres Correia, from conquering most of the region city by city, between 1242 and 1249, including Silves. In March 1249, King Afonso III of Portugal captured Faro, the last Muslim stronghold in Algarve, ending the Portuguese Reconquista.

The entitlement of Afonso III of Portugal as King of Portugal and the Algarve would serve as a reaction to Alfonso X of Castile's claim to the Algarve and was designed to demonstrate the rights of the Portuguese monarch on the region concerned.

The issue between the sovereigns of Castille and Portugal was eventually settled by the Treaty of Badajoz (1267), where King Alfonso X gave up his claims of the Algarve, making his grandson Dinis the heir to the throne of the Algarve, which dictated the terms of its incorporation into the Portuguese crown. The treaty, though, allowed the use of the title of King of the Algarve for King Alfonso X and his descendants, since King Alfonso X had acquired the territories of Al-Gharb Al-Andalus on the other side of the Guadiana river. The kings of Castile, and then Spain, would add the title to their repertoire of titles until the ascent of Queen Isabel II of Spain to the throne.

Age of Discoveries

During the Age of Discoveries, the Algarve served as the location for the embarkment for many voyages, mainly those funded by the Infante D. Henrique. Prince Henry also set up his famous school of navigation at Sagres Point, though the idea of a real school building and campus is highly disputed. Most of the voyages set sail from Lagos.

The Algarves of either side of the sea in Africa

The name of the Algarvian Kingdom suffered some minor changes due to the Portuguese North African conquests, which were considered an extension of the kingdom of Algarve. John I of Portugal added to the title of ""King of Portugal and the Algarve"", the title ""Lord of Ceuta"", and his grandson Afonso V of Portugal, in turn, styled himself ""Lord of Ceuta and Alcacer-Ceguer in Africa"" (after 1458). The 1471 conquest of Asilah, Tangiers and Larache, together with North African previous holdings, led to the creation of the title ""the Algarves from either side of the sea in Africa"", leaving the European Algarve to become ""the Algarve behind the sea.""

Thus, it was not until 1471 that ""the Kingdom of the Algarve"" led to ""the Kingdom of the Algarves"", due to the increase of Portuguese possessions in Northern Africa, which were made as possessions of the Kingdom of the Algarve. The Portuguese monarchs therefore adopted the title that they would use until the fall of the monarchy in 1910: ""Kings of Portugal and the Algarves of either side of the sea in Africa"". The title would continue to be used even after the abandonment of the last North African holding in Mazagan (Portuguese: Mazagão; lost by Portugal in 1769).

19th century conflicts

During the 19th century, a serious clash between liberals and Miguelites, caused an exodus of people from the Algarvian inlands to the coastal cities. José Joaquim Sousa Reis, the Remexido, and fought in the inlands and attacked the coastal cities, bringing the urban population into turmoil. The turmoil of the Algarve intensified in the years between 1834 and 1838, when the Algarve saw battles on a level it had never seen before. On November 26, 1836, Miguel I of Portugal named Remexido Governor of the Kingdom of the Algarve and Acting Commander in Chief of all the Royalist Troops, Regular and Irregular Armies, and the Operations in the South. Remexido, however, was shot in Faro on August 2, 1838.

Passage:
Nanosecond
A nanosecond (ns) is a SI unit of time equal to one billionth of a second (10 or 1/1,000,000,000 s). One nanosecond is to one second as one second is to 31.71 years.

The word nanosecond is formed by the prefix nano and the unit second. Its symbol is ns.

A nanosecond is equal to 1000 picoseconds or  microsecond.  Because the next SI unit is 1000 times larger, times of 10 and 10 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of nanoseconds.

Times of this magnitude are commonly encountered in telecommunications, pulsed lasers and some areas of electronics.

Light travels exactly 29.9792458  centimeters in 1 nanosecond. This is equivalent to 11.8 inches, leading some to refer to a nanosecond as a light-foot.  A light-foot is actually ~1.0167033621639674471063578257196 nanoseconds. 
The earliest use of the term is by George Gamow.  Another early reference commonly given  is to Admiral Grace Hopper, who used to give out pieces of wire about a foot long to illustrate the eventual problem of building very high speed computers.   If it takes light a nanosecond to go a foot (in a vacuum, slower in copper), then a computer built with parts connected by half this distance, 15 cm of wire, would take at least a nanosecond to send data to a part and get a response.  The solution, developed in Hopper's lifetime, was first the integrated circuit and later the multi-core processor.

""Once she presented a piece of wire about a foot long, and explained that it represented a nanosecond, since it was the maximum distance electricity could travel in wire in one-billionth of a second. She often contrasted this nanosecond with a microsecond - a coil of wire nearly a thousand feet long - as she encouraged programmers not to waste even a microsecond.""

Common measurements 

* 0.5 nanoseconds (0.5 ns) – the average life of a molecule of positronium hydride
* 1.0 nanosecond – cycle time for radio frequency 1 GHz (1 hertz), an inverse unit.   This corresponds to a radio wavelength of 1 light-nanosecond or 0.3 m, as can be calculated by multiplying 1 ns by the speed of light (approximately 3 m/s) to determine the distance traveled.
* 1.0 nanosecond – cycle time for a 1 GHz processor. , common processors have frequencies around 1–3.5 GHz, so the cycle time is somewhat shorter than a nanosecond.
* 1.017 nanoseconds (approximately) – time taken for light to travel 1 foot in a vacuum
* 3.33564095 nanoseconds (approximately) – time taken for light to travel 1 metre in a vacuum   (In air or water light travels more slowly; see index of refraction)
* 10 nanoseconds – one ""shake"", (as in a ""shake of a lamb's tail"") approximate time of one generation of a nuclear chain reaction with fast neutrons
* 10 nanoseconds – cycle time for frequency 100 MHz (1 hertz), radio wavelength 3 m (VHF, FM band)
* 12 nanoseconds – half-life of a K meson
* 20–40 nanoseconds – time of fusion reaction in a hydrogen bomb
* 77 nanoseconds – a sixth (a 60th of a 60th of a 60th of a 60th of a second)
* 100 nanoseconds – cycle time for frequency 10 MHz, radio wavelength 30 m (shortwave)
* 333 nanoseconds – cycle time of highest medium wave radio frequency, 3 MHz
* 500 nanoseconds – T1 time of Josephson phase qubit (see also Qubit) as of May 2005
* 1000 nanoseconds - one microsecond

Passage:
Hāngi
Hāngi is a traditional New Zealand Māori method of cooking food using heated rocks buried in a pit oven. It is still used for special occasions.

To ""lay a hāngi"" or ""put down a hāngi"" involves digging a pit in the ground, heating stones in the pit with a large fire, placing baskets of food on top of the stones, and covering everything with earth for several hours before uncovering (or lifting) the hāngi. 

There are many variations and details that can be altered. Hāngi ""experts"" have developed and improved methods that often, like the stones themselves, have been handed down for generations. Another name sometimes used is umu, for instance the umu tī, used in the South Island to cook Cabbage trees (Cordyline australis). 

The evolution of hāngi methods 

Evidence from early Polynesian settler sites in New Zealand such as Wairau Bar and in coastal Otago Peninsula from about 1280 shows a significant number of large cooking pits or umu which were designed to cook Ti-pore or various species of Cordyline. This was a common east Polynesian practice in the Cook Islands and Society Islands. The remains of large umu have also been found in the Kermadec Islands. The .900 long, carrot shaped tap root was cooked in a large stone lined pit for between 1 and 2 days. Various sources say it was baked while some say steamed. The result was a fibrous mass of sweet pulp that had a bitter after taste. Investigation in Otago shows that most pits were used only once or perhaps twice before making a new pit. Some sources say the longer the cooking, the sweeter the pulp. This may have been due to the evaporation of the water content. The distinguishing feature of a Ti- pore was its large size compared to a normal cooking earth oven.  
Prior to colonisation and the introduction of metals and wire, food was laid out on clean sticks, bark, large leaves and other vegetation to minimize direct contact with the hot rocks and reduce burning. Carved bowls and flat rocks were also used for this purpose.
Leaves, sticks and vegetation were used to cover the food and to prevent crushing from the weight of the earth on top.

Many different hāngi methods are now used. Wire baskets became widely used in the early 19th century with sacking and cloth replacing leaves and bark as the covering of choice. Red hot iron or steel may be used in addition to or instead of stones.

In the early 21st century, gas heated stainless steel ""hāngi machines"" are sometimes used to replicate the style of cooking without the need for a wood fire, rocks and a pit.

Passage:
Pholadidae
Pholadidae, known as piddocks or angelwings, are a family of bivalve mollusc similar to a clam.

Background

Pidocks are unique in that each side of their shells is divided into 2 or 3 separate sections. Furthermore, one of the piddock's shells has a set of ridges or ""teeth"", which they use to grind away at clay or soft rock and create tubular burrows. The shape of these burrows is due to the rotating motion of the piddock as it grinds the rock to make its home. The piddock stays in the burrow it digs for the entirety of its eight-year lifespan, with only its siphon exposed to take in water that it filters for food. When the piddock dies and leaves an empty tubular burrow, other marine life such as sea anemone, crabs and other molluscs may use the burrow.

Some species of Pholadidae may reach up to 18 cm (7″). Their coloration is typically white, though through consumption of red tide algae some may develop a pink coloration.

* The angelwing species Cyrtopleura costata has approximately 26 radiating ribs. Growth lines run horizontally over the surface of the shell. Angelwings have a spoon-shaped brace under the beak of the shell, called the apophysis, where the mollusc's foot muscles are attached. Cyrtopleura costata possesses long siphons which protrude from its burrow and circulate water as the source for its food supply. It cannot retract its siphons into the protection of its shell, so the two valves can never shut completely. The muscles fusing the shell's valves together are weak, making it rare to find angelwings with both halves still intact. Some shell hunters dig for the living clam, and if dug up, the fragile shell must be placed immediately into a container of water or it will close and shatter. The angelwing's shell is popular with collectors, as well as a delicious food staple. The angelwing lives offshore and in estuaries, sometimes as much as a metre (three feet) deep in the mud or clay.
* The Atlantic mud-piddock, Barnea truncata, often referred to as the fallen angelwing, is classed among the angelwing varieties, growing up to 5.7 cm (2¼″) and is similar to other angelwings but with weaker sculpture. One end is squared off and the other end pointed. Loose accessory plates are located above the hinge on live specimens. It possesses a white exterior and interior. It burrows into mud, clay or softwood. Occasionally it is washed onto sounds and ocean beaches, and has a habitat range from Maine to Brazil. This fragile shell is rarely dug from mud without breaking. It burrows deeply and has long, united siphons.
* The false angelwing Petricola pholadiformis, is also classed among varieties of angelwing, growing up to 7 cm (2¾″). It has a thin, elongate shell resembling a small angelwing but lacks the rolled-out hinge area. Its beak is at one end of the shell with strong radial ribbing on the beak end. Teeth are located on hinge and a deep pallial sinus and partially united siphons. It has a white exterior and interior. It typically burrows into hard surfaces such as clay or peat in intertidal zones. It is commonly found on sounds and ocean beaches with a range from Canada to Uruguay.
* The common piddock (Pholas dactylus) is known for its bioluminescence[http://www.marlin.ac.uk/species/Pholasdactylus.htm Basic information for Pholas dactylus (Common piddock)]  and was investigated by Raphaël Dubois in his 1887 discovery of luciferin.

Clouds Hill
Clouds Hill is an isolated cottage near Wareham in the county of Dorset in South West England. It is the former home of T. E. Lawrence (""Lawrence of Arabia"") and is now run as a writer's home museum by the National Trust. The site is in
the parish of Turners Puddle in Purbeck District.

History

The small building has colourwashed brick walls and a tiled roof. It was probably built as forester's cottage in the early 19th century.  The lintel over the door now bears a Greek inscription οὐ φροντὶς (""Why Worry""). It is now a Grade II* listed building as ""Clouds Hill (Lawrence of Arabia's Cottage)""; it was upgraded from Grade II in 2015. 

Lawrence first rented the cottage in 1923 while stationed at nearby Bovington Camp with the Tank Corps.  He made it habitable with the help of a friend, then bought it in 1925 and used it as a holiday home. He described it as an earthly paradise and wrote ""Nothing in Clouds Hill is to be a care upon the world. While I have it there shall be nothing exquisite or unique in it. Nothing to anchor me."" The cottage had no electric lights and three living rooms, described as an eating room, book room and music room. For heat insulation Lawrence had the eating room lined with asbestos that was covered in aluminium foil, and he kept his food under glass domes. In the book room he installed a large leather divan, and in the music room above it he had his gramophone ""with a huge amplifier horn"", a leather sofa and chair.

In 1935 Lawrence left the Royal Air Force and lived at Clouds Hill. A few weeks later, at the age of 46, he suffered severe head injuries in a motorcycle accident close to the cottage, and died in the Bovington Camp hospital on 19 May 1935. The following year, his heir, his brother A. W. Lawrence gave Clouds Hill to the National Trust. It is now a museum, dedicated to Lawrence. It is open to visitors from the end of March to the beginning of October, Thursday – Sunday.

The cottage remains largely as Lawrence left it at his death.  It features an exhibition detailing Lawrence's life, and most of his original furniture and possessions. The cottage reflects his complex personality and links to the Middle East.

The circular Lawrence of Arabia Trail starts and finishes at Bovington's The Tank Museum, taking in Clouds Hill and the churchyard of St Nicholas' Church in Moreton, Lawrence's final resting place. 

Sleeping bags

Lawrence reserved a sleeping bag for guests and visitors who stayed overnight. In 1965 it was stolen. The bag's disappearance coincided with the release of Lawrence of Arabia, the film which popularised his story and it was thought the theft could have been inspired by the publicity and excitement generated by the film.

In 2001, the sleeping bag was returned. The Independent reported: 

""The sleeping bag that served as a guest bed to some of the 20th century's most distinguished authors at TE Lawrence's weekend retreat has been returned 36 years after it was stolen. National Trust custodians of Clouds Hill, the author's cottage in Dorset, were amazed when a weather-beaten package from Belgium arrived containing the sleeping bag, along with a sheepish note that read: 'This is yours'. The bag, embroidered with the word 'tuum' ['yours'], was provided for guests at the cottage, while Lawrence slept on the floor in the other sleeping bag, marked 'meum' ['mine']. According to Jeremy Wilson, Lawrence's biographer, tuum's occupants included George Bernard Shaw, E. M. Forster and Robert Graves""

Fougasse (bread)
In French cuisine, fougasse is a type of bread typically associated with Provence but found (with variations) in other regions. Some versions are sculpted or slashed into a pattern resembling an ear of wheat.

History and etymology

In ancient Rome, panis focacius was a flatbread baked in the ashes of the hearth (focus in Latin).  This became a diverse range of breads that include focaccia in Italian cuisine, hogaza in Spain, fogassa in Catalonia, fugàssa in Ligurian, pogača in the Balkans, pogácsa in Hungary, fougasse in Provence (originally spelled fogatza), fouace or fouée in other French regions and on the Channel Islands.  The Provence version is more likely to have additions in the form of olives, cheese, or anchovies, which may be regarded as a primitive form of pizza without the tomato.

There is also in Portugal the fogaça, a sweet bread. In Brazil, pão sovado is a typical big fougasse, while a recipe, typical of the states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and surrounding regions, that is halfway between fougasse and bolillo (in these regions known as pão francês or pão-de-sal), somewhat resembling a savory small brioche, is called pão suíço. They are perhaps the sweetest of savory artisanal bread recipes commonly made in Brazil.

Fougasse was traditionally used to assess the temperature of a wood fired oven. The time it would take to bake gives an idea of the oven temperature and whether the rest of the bread can be loaded.

Fougasse is also a type of pastry from Monaco that is topped with almonds and nuts.

Use in dishes

It is used to make the French version of calzone, which can have cheese and small squarish strips of bacon inside the pocket made by folding over the bread. Other variations include dried fruit, Roquefort and nuts or olives and goat cheese. It is known by extension as a fougasse even though it is more a sandwich than just a type of bread.
Question:
Fougasse, associated with Provence, is what type of food?
Answer:
Somun
Passage:
Waterborne diseases
Waterborne diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that most commonly are transmitted in contaminated fresh water. Infection commonly results during bathing, washing, drinking, in the preparation of food, or the consumption of food thus infected. Various forms of waterborne diarrheal disease probably are the most prominent examples, and affect mainly children in developing countries; according to the World Health Organization, such diseases account for an estimated 4.1% of the total DALY global burden of disease, and cause about 1.8 million human deaths annually. The World Health Organization estimates that 88% of that burden is attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene. 

Overview

The term ""waterborne disease"" is reserved largely for infections that predominantly are transmitted through contact with or consumption of infected water. Trivially, many infections may be transmitted by microbes or parasites that accidentally, possibly as a result of exceptional circumstances, have entered the water, but the fact that there might be an occasional freak infection need not mean that it is useful to categorise the resulting disease as ""waterborne"". Nor is it common practice to refer to diseases such as malaria as ""waterborne"" just because mosquitoes have aquatic phases in their life cycles, or because treating the water they inhabit happens to be an effective strategy in control of the mosquitoes that are the vectors.

Microorganisms causing diseases that characteristically are waterborne prominently include protozoa and bacteria, many of which are intestinal parasites, or invade the tissues or circulatory system through walls of the digestive tract. Various other waterborne diseases are caused by viruses. (In spite of philosophical difficulties associated with defining viruses as ""organisms"", it is practical and convenient to regard them as microorganisms in this connection.)

Yet other important classes of water-borne diseases are caused by metazoan parasites. Typical examples include certain Nematoda, that is to say ""roundworms"". As an example of water-borne Nematode infections, one important waterborne nematodal disease is Dracunculiasis. It is acquired by swallowing water in which certain copepoda occur that act as vectors for the Nematoda. Anyone swallowing a copepod that happens to be infected with Nematode larvae in the genus Dracunculus, becomes liable to infection. The larvae cause guinea worm disease. 

Another class of waterborne metazoan pathogens are certain members of the Schistosomatidae, a family of blood flukes. They usually infect victims that make skin contact with the water. Blood flukes are pathogens that cause Schistosomiasis of various forms, more or less seriously affecting hundreds of millions of people world-wide. 

Long before modern studies had established the germ theory of disease, or any advanced understanding of the nature of water as a vehicle for transmitting disease, traditional beliefs had cautioned against the consumption of water, rather favouring processed beverages such as beer, wine and tea. For example, in the camel caravans that crossed Central Asia along the Silk Road, the explorer Owen Lattimore noted, ""The reason we drank so much tea was because of the bad water. Water alone, unboiled, is never drunk. There is a superstition that it causes blisters on the feet."" 

Socioeconomic impact

Waterborne diseases can have a significant impact on the economy, locally as well as internationally. People who are infected by a waterborne disease are usually confronted with related costs and not seldom with a huge financial burden. This is especially the case in less developed countries. The financial losses are mostly caused by e.g. costs for medical treatment and medication, costs for transport, special food, and by the loss of manpower. Many families must even sell their land to pay for treatment in a proper hospital. On average, a family spends about 10% of the monthly households income per person infected.

Women's Cricket World Cup
The ICC Women's Cricket World Cup is the premier international championship of women's One Day International cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was originally administered by the International Women's Cricket Council until the two associations merged in 2005. The first tournament was held in England in 1973, two years before the first men's tournament.

Participation in the tournament has varied through the eight competitions: fifteen different teams have played, but only Australia, England and New Zealand have appeared in every tournament. India have appeared in all but two of the competitions. Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Young England have all appeared in just one tournament: in each case, the first competition, in 1973.

The most recent tournament, the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup, was held in India for the third time in February. In the final Australia beat West Indies by 114 runs at the Brabourne Stadium.

History

First World Cup

Women's international cricket was first played in 1934, when a party from England toured Australia and New Zealand. The first Test match was played on 28–31 December 1934, and was won by England.  The first Test against New Zealand followed early the following year. These three nations remained the only Test playing teams in women's cricket until 1960, when South Africa played a number of matches against England. Limited overs cricket was first played by first-class teams in England in 1962.  Nine years later, the first international one day match was played in men's cricket, when England took on Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 

Talks began in 1971 about holding a World Cup for women's cricket, led by Jack Hayward.  South Africa, under pressure from the world for their apartheid laws, were not invited to take part in the competition.  Both of the other two Test playing nations, Australia and New Zealand were invited. Hayward had previously organised tours of the West Indies by England women, and it was from this region that the other two competing nations were drawn; Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago. To make up the numbers, England also fielded a ""Young England"" team, and an ""International XI"" was also included. Five South Africans were invited to play for the International XI as a means of compensation for the team not being invited, but these invitations were later withdrawn.

The inaugural tournament was held at a variety of venues across England in June and July 1973,  two years before the first men's Cricket World Cup was played.  The competition was played as a round-robin tournament, and the last scheduled match was England against Australia. Australia went into the game leading the table by a solitary point: they had won four matches and had one abandoned. England had also won four matches, but they had lost to New Zealand.  As a result, the match also served as a de facto final for the competition. England won the match, held at Edgbaston, Birmingham by 92 runs to win the tournament.

Men's Fastest Mile Times (World Records) - About.com Sports
World Records for Men's Fastest Mile Times
By Mike Rosenbaum
Updated September 23, 2016.
It’s never been an Olympic or World Championship event, yet the mile remains the only non-metric race distance in which the IAAF recognizes a world record. Long after the other non-metric distances have vanished from the world record books, those 5,280 feet, or 1,760 yards – or about 1.61 kilometers – continue to capture the imaginations of runners and fans alike as a premier middle distance event.
The first IAAF-recognized world record in the mile was run by John Paul Jones of the U.S. No, the record doesn’t go back to the American Revolution. This John Paul Jones performed his feat on May 31, 1913, in Allston, Mass., where he completed the mile in 4:14.4. France’s Jules Ladoumegue later brought the mark under 4:10, running 4:09.2 on Oct. 4, 1931, in Paris. The mark crept down toward the 4-minute mark throughout the 1940s. In a 3-year period from July 1942 through July 1945 a pair of Swedes, Gunder Hagg, and Arne Andersson, exchanged the record six times.
continue reading below our video
Understanding Baseball
Hagg ended the give-and-take with a time of 4:01.4 on July 17, 1945. His mark stood for almost nine years, during which time the pundits debated on whether a 4-minute mile was humanly possible, as a runner after runner tried and failed to crack a key psychological – and, as some believed, physical – barrier.
The 4-Minute Mile:
On May 6, 1954, great Britain’s Roger Bannister answered the questions by running the first sub-4:00 miles, finishing in 3:59.4 while assisted by a pair of pacemakers. Bannister, then a medical student, developed his own training methods – featuring relatively short, intense workouts – that carried him through on a windy day. Bannister ran lap times of 57.5, 60.7, 62.3 and 58.9 seconds. He was timed in 3:43.0 through 1500 meters.
While Bannister is famous for shattering the 4-minute barrier, many forget that he held the title for less than seven weeks before Australia’s John Landy finished in 3:58.0 on June 21, 1954. Bannister retired from racing before the end of the year, to devote himself to medicine, but not before racing against Landy in “The Mile of the Century” in Vancouver that August. Landy shot in front by the end of the first lap, hoping to wear out the normally fast-finishing Bannister. But Bannister ran his own race, paced himself, then shot into the lead with less than 90 yards remaining to win in 3:58.8 to Landy’s 3:59.6, the first time two runners topped four minutes in the same race.
In 1958 Australia’s Herb Elliott ran 3:54.5 to break the record set the previous year by Derek Ibbotson by 2.7 seconds, the biggest drop in the world record time during the IAAF era.
The record returned to U.S. soil in 1966 when the precocious Jim Ryun posted a 3:51.3 time, which he lowered to 3:51.1 the following year. Ryun was the first high school runner to break four minutes, with a time of 3:59 in 1964. At age 18 he owned the U.S. mile record of 3:55.3. At 19 he owned the world record. He was the fourth and, as of 2012, the last American to reign as the mile’s world record-holder.
John Walker Cracks 3:50:
New Zealand’s John Walker took the record below 3:50 in August 1975 with a time of 3:49.4, fulfilling his promise to the organizers of the meet held in Goteborg, Sweden. Walker convinced meet officials to change the scheduled 1500-meter race to the mile, telling them he’d take a shot at the world record. He was paced through the first half mile, with lap times of 55.8 and 59.3, then sped up on the final two laps, running the third quarter in 57.9 and the fourth in 56.4 seconds. Walker eventually became the first man to run 100 sub-4:00 miles.
Great Britain then enjoyed a stretch of 14 years in which three different British runners owned the mark. Just as Hagg and Andersson played give-and-go with the record in the ‘40s, so too did Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett in 1979-81. In a 25-month stretch, beginning in July 1979 when Coe edged Walker’s mark by four-tenths of a second, Coe owned the record three times and Ovett twice. Coe began the British siege in only the third-mile race of his life, in an Oslo meet in which Walker participated. Coe finally prevailed in his duel with Ovett, as Coe’s time of 3:47.33 set in August of 1981 lived for almost four years before Steve Cram lowered it to 3:46.32 in 1985.
El Guerrouj Takes Charge:
Only one African runner – Filbert Bayi, who broke Ryun’s record and held the mile mark for just three months – had owned the mile record before Algeria’s Noureddine Morceli topped Cram’s mark by running 3:44.39 on Sept. 5, 1993. The 1.93-second drop in the record was the largest margin since Ryun set his first record in 1966. Morocco’s Hicham El Guerrouj then lowered the mark to 3:43.13 on July 7, 1999 – almost identical to Bannister’s 1500-meter time in 1954 – yet came close to losing the race, held in Rome’s Olympic Stadium. Noah Ngeny ran with El Guerrouj all the way and edged Morceli’s record as well, finishing in 3:43.40. With his mark still intact in 2015, El Guerrouj has held the IAAF mile record longer than anyone else, while Ngeny’s time remained No. 2 on the all-time list. As of 2015, El Guerrouj had seven of the top 10 mile times in history; Alan Webb owns the fastest mile of the 21st century by someone other than El Guerrouj, posting a time of 3:46.91 in 2007.

Cash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer spree
* Premier League leads way as soccer clubs splash TV cash
* Real Madrid and Barcelona defy Spain's economic downturn
* Clubs seen complying with UEFA rules despite investment
By Keith Weir
LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - European soccer clubs have reinvested cash from television deals to go on a record-breaking summer spending spree led by teams from the English Premier League and Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona.
Clubs in the English top flight had spent 630 million pounds ($980.5 million) by the player transfer deadline on Monday night. Teams in the big European leagues must now wait until January before they can hire new players.
The spending by English clubs broke the 2008 record of 500 million pounds, according to figures compiled by business services group Deloitte, and underlined the Premier League's status as the world's richest national competition.
""As the financial rewards for participation and success in the Premier League increase, so it follows that clubs are investing on the pitch to ensure they continue to benefit from the remarkable Premier League growth story,"" Deloitte's Dan Jones said.
Champions Manchester United and the other 19 Premier League teams are expected to share revenues of about 1.6 billion pounds this season thanks to enhanced television deals with BSkyB and BT in Britain, and broadcasters around the globe that began last month.
It was not all one-way traffic as the Premier League lost one of its biggest names when Real Madrid bought Welshman Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur for a world record 100 million euros ($132 million).
Not to be outdone, Real's perennial rivals Barcelona spent $75 million to buy Brazil forward Neymar from Brazilian top division club Santos.
PLAYING FAIR?
Spending such sums might appear to defy logic given Spain's economic problems but Real and Barcelona enjoy the luxury of doing their own TV deals rather than pooling revenues as happens in England and other major leagues.
That has made the two clubs the world's richest in terms of revenues and allowed them to remain buyers when many of their Spanish rivals are forced to sell their best players.
Real and Barcelona have TV deals with Spanish production and distribution company Mediapro. They both also have lucrative new main sponsorship deals this season - Barcelona with Qatar Airways and Real with the Emirates airline names on their kit.
Overall spending levels may also raise eyebrows when loss-making clubs are supposed to be complying with new Financial Fair Play rules introduced by UEFA, European soccer's governing body, to put soccer on a more stable footing.
""A lot of English clubs have gone on a spending spree but they haven't breached the Financial Fair Play rules as they are only spending what they have earned,"" said Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports business at England's Coventry University.
Clubs also have the advantage of spreading the cost of a player's transfer over the duration of his contract in their accounts, lessening the impact on the bottom line.
Many clubs also offload players to help fund spending.
Real Madrid are a case in point - recouping half of what they paid for Bale by selling German international Mesut Ozil to Premier League Arsenal.
Indeed, the total invested by Premier League clubs comes down to 400 million pounds when proceeds from sales such as that of Bale are factored in.
Spanish clubs actually generated a surplus of 95 million pounds from player trading this summer, according to Deloitte, while clubs from Italy's cash-strapped Serie A also posted a small profit.

Passage:
Royal Parks of London
The Royal Parks of London are lands originally owned by the monarchy of the United Kingdom for the recreation (mostly hunting) of the royal family. They are part of the hereditary possessions of The Crown.

Parks

With increasing urbanisation of London, some of these were preserved as freely accessible open space and became public parks with the introduction of the Crown Lands Act 1851. There are today eight parks formally described by this name and they cover almost  2000 ha of land in Greater London.

* Bushy Park, 445 ha  
* Green Park, 19 ha  
* Greenwich Park, 74 ha  
* Hyde Park, 142 ha  
* Kensington Gardens, 111 ha  
* Regent's Park, 166 ha  
* Richmond Park, 955 hectares   (2360 acre)
* St. James's Park, 23 ha  

Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens (which are adjacent), Green Park, Regent's Park and St James's Park are the largest green spaces in central London. Bushy Park, Greenwich Park and Richmond Park are in the suburbs. The Royal Parks agency also manages Brompton Cemetery, Grosvenor Square Gardens, Victoria Tower Gardens and the gardens of 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street. 

Hampton Court Park is also a royal park within Greater London, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks. 

Legal position

The public does not have any legal right to use the Parks, as public access depends on the grace and favour of The Crown, although there are public rights of way across the land. The Royal Parks Agency manages the Royal Parks under powers derived from section 22 of the Crown Lands Act 1851. As part of its statutory management function the Agency permits the public to use the Parks for recreational purposes, subject to regulations issued under the Parks Regulation Acts 1872–1926 which are considered necessary to secure proper management, preserve order and prevent abuse within the Parks. The current regulations are the Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997.

Management

They are managed by The Royal Parks (an executive agency of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport) and are policed by the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police (the English section of the previous force policing the parks, the Royal Parks Constabulary, has been abolished). The main form of funding for the Royal Parks is a central government grant. This contrasts with most of London's other parks, which are funded by local borough councils. The Royal Parks generate additional income from commercial activities such as catering and staging public events such as concerts.

The Royal Parks Foundation is a registered charity which raises funds to protect, support and create new opportunities within the Parks. They have a number of membership schemes such as adoption and champion programmes.

Mayoral control

In 2010, Mayor of London Boris Johnson proposed that control over the Royal Parks should be devolved to the Greater London Authority  and the government put forward proposals for that to happen later on that year.  The plan was welcomed by Royal Parks but it is yet to be implemented following the 2012 London Olympic games.

If the eight Royal Parks in London are arranged alphabetically which comes last?

Drawing pin
A thumb tack (North American English) or push pin is a short nail or pin used to fasten items to a wall or board for display and intended to be inserted by hand, generally without the assistance of tools. A variety of names are used to refer to different designs intended for various purpose. Thumb tack and push pin are both sometimes compounded (thumbtack or pushpin) or hyphenated (thumb-tack or push-pin). Thumb tacks made of brass, tin or iron may be referred to as brass tacks, brass pins, tin tacks or iron tacks, respectively.  These terms are particularly used in the idiomatic expression to come (or get) down to brass (or otherwise) tacks, meaning to consider basic facts of a situation.  Drawing pin or drawing-pin refers to thumb tacks used to hold drawings on drawing boards. Map pin or map tack refers to thumb tacks used to mark locations on a map and to hold the map in place.

History

Edwin Moore invented the ""push-pin"" in 1900 and founded the Moore Push-Pin Company. Moore described the push-pin as a pin with a handle.  Later, in 1904, in Lychen, German clockmaker Johann Kirsten invented flat-headed thumb tacks for use with drawings. 

Design

A thumb tack has two basic components: the head, often made of plastic, metal or  wood, and the body, usually made of steel or brass. The head is wide to distribute the force of pushing the tack in, allowing only the hands to be used. Many head designs exist: flat, domed, spherical, cylindrical and a variety of novelty heads such as hearts or stars. Thumb tack heads also come in a variety of colors. These can be particularly useful to mark different locations on a map. Some thumb tack designs have the body cut out of the head and bent downward to produce a tack.

Domed or gripped heads are sometimes preferred over flat heads as dropped flat-headed tacks will point upward, posing a hazard.  Thumb tacks also pose a hazard of ingestion and choking, where they may do serious harm.

","['55', 'fifty-five']",9233,triviaqa,en,,1f4fecc3601c6f6fd6eb04d9996d67dc8c27b9eb4442fecb," The Kingdom of the Algarve was a nominal kingdom within the Kingdom of Portugal. It was the second dominion of the Portuguese Crown and supposedly a kingdom apart from Portugal. The title King of Silves was first used by Sancho I of Portugal after the first conquest of Silve in 1189. In modern usage, ""killing the fatted calf"" can simply mean to celebrate in an exuberant manner, as used in the Elton John song ""Bennie and the Jets"" The title was adopted by his grandson Afonso III of Portugal as a part of the titles and honours of the Portugal Crown. The Portuguese and Castilian conquests went south, to take lands from the Muslims that they claimed as theirs. Portugal conquered and secured much of its southern borders during the reigns of King Sancho II of Portugal and King AfonsoIII of Portugal, ending the Portuguese Reconquista in 1249. In 1267, Alfonso X of Castile gave up his claims to the kingdom, making his grandson Dinis the heir to the throne, which dictated the terms of its incorporation into the Portuguese crown. The Treaty of Badajoz (1267), settled the issue between the sovereigns of Castille and Portugal on the region concerned, was eventually settled by the Portuguese monarch King Dinis of Portugal in 1267. The Algarvian kingdom had no institutions, special privileges, or autonomy, and was just an honorific title for theAlgarve based on its history and was very similar to the rest of thePortuguese provinces. In the Bible, when the prodigal son returns, the father ""kills the fatter calf"" to show that the celebration is out of the ordinary. The word is a metaphor or symbol of festive celebration and rejoicing for someone's long-awaited return. It derives from the parable of the Prodigal Son in the New Testament, and is used to refer to someone who has returned from a long absence. It is also used to describe a livestock that was fed a special diet to fatten it up, thus making it more flavorsome when prepared as a meal. In biblical times, Slaughtering this livestock was to be done on rare and special occasions, so it was called a ""fatted calf"", or a ""calf"" The word ""fats"" means a piece of livestock that has been fattened up for a special occasion, such as when a child has returned. The name of the Algarvian Kingdom suffered some minor changes due to the Portuguese North African conquests, which were considered an extension of the kingdom of Algarve. The Portuguese monarchs therefore adopted the title that they would use until the fall of the monarchy in 1910: ""Kings of Portugal and the AlGarves of either side of the sea in Africa"" A nanosecond (ns) is a SI unit of time equal to one billionth of a second (10 or 1/1,000,000,.000 s) One nanose Cond is to one second as one second is to 31.71 years. A light-foot is actually ~8.8 inches, leading some to refer to a Nanosecond as a light- foot. The earliest use of the term is by Admiral Grace Hopper, who used it to give out pieces of wire to give a computer parts. If a computer built with parts connected by half a mile of wire, then the wire would take at least 15 cm of wire. The word nanoseCond is formed by the symbol is nano and the unit second. A nanosecond is equal to 1000 picoseconds or microsecond. This is equivalent to 11 inches, or 1.1-1.396744710678257196 nanOSEconds. The term is also used to illustrate the eventual problem of building very high speed computers (a foot in copper, a foot in a vacuum) in a very slow vacuum. It was not until 1471 that ""the Kingdom of the algarve"" led to ""the Algarves"" due to increase of Portuguese possessions in Northern Africa. The title would continue to be used even after the abandonment of the last North African holding in Mazagan (Portuguese: Mazagão; lost by Portugal in 1769) In the 19th century, a serious clash between liberals and Miguelites, caused an exodus of people from the inlands to the coastal cities. José Joaquim Sousa Reis, the Remexido, was shot in Faro on August 2, 1838, and brought the urban population into turmoil. The turmoil of theAlgarve intensified in the years between 1834 and 1838. On November 26, 1836, Miguel I of Portugal named Remexido Governor of the Kingdom of. all the Royalist Troops, Regular and Irregular Armies, and the Operations in the South. Hāngi is a traditional New Zealand Māori method of cooking food using heated rocks buried in a pit oven. It is still used for special occasions. The average life of a molecule of positronium hydride is 0.5 nanoseconds (0.5 ns) This corresponds to a radio wavelength of 1 light-nanosecond or 0.3 m, as can be calculated by multiplying 1 ns by the speed of light (approximately 3 m/s) to determine the distance traveled. The cycle time for a 1 GHz processor is 1.0 nanose Cond (1 hertz), an inverse unit. The time of fusion reaction in a hydrogen bomb is 20–40 nanoseConds (1/2 to 1/3) of a second (see also Qubit) As of May 2005, the cycle time of a Josephson phase qubit was 500 nanose conds (T1 time of Josephson qubit) This is one microsecond shorter than a nanoseminute. The solution, developed in Hopper's lifetime, was first the integrated circuit and later the multi-core processor. This was a common east Polynesian practice in the Cook Islands. The remains of large umu have also been found in the Kermadec Islands, where carrot root was cooked in large stone lined pit for between 1 and 2 days. The result was a bitter sweet pulp that some say steamed was a fibrous mass of fibrous pulp. Some sources say the sweeter the pulp, the longer the cooking, the better the cooking. The pit was compared to a normal cooking oven. The distinguishing feature of a Ti-pore cooking oven was its large size compared to its normal size. This may have been due to the evaporation of the water content of the Ti- pore. The pits were used only perhaps once or twice before making a new pit. The Pit oven was used to cook Ti-Pore or various species of Cordyline (Cordyline australis) in Otago Peninsula from about 1280 to 1280. It was also used in Wairau Bar and in coastal Otago, where it was used on the Otago peninsula from about 1250 to 1250. It has been suggested that the pit ovens were used to clean and clean the earth, and to clean out the wire and wire sticks that were laid out on the ground. It may also have been used to keep food clean after the introduction of colonisation. Hangi is a traditional New Zealand Maori method of cooking using a pit. Wire baskets became widely used in the early 19th century with sacking and cloth replacing leaves and bark as the covering of choice. Red hot iron or steel may be used in addition to or instead of stones. In the early 21st century, gas heated stainless steel ""hāngi machines"" are sometimes used to replicate the style of cooking without the need for a wood fire, rocks and a pit in the first place. The common piddock (Pholasactylus) is a family of bivalve mollusc similar to a clam or clam-like creature. The shell is popular with collectors, as well as a delicious food staple. It burrows into mud, clay or softwood. Occasionally it is washed onto sounds and ocean beaches, and has a habitat range from Maine to Brazil. This fragile shell is rarely dug from mud without breaking. It is commonly found on ocean beaches with a range from Canada to Uruguay. Some species of Pholadidae may reach up to 18 cm (7″) Their coloration is typically white, though through consumption of red tide algae some may develop a pink coloration. The Atlantic mud-piddock, Barnea truncata, is classed among the angelwing varieties, growing up to 5.7cm (2¼″) and is similar to other angelwings but with weaker sculpture. It has a thin, elongate shell resembling a small small angelwing but lacks the rolled-out hinge area. Its beak at one end is partially united and has strong ribbing on the beak end. Teeth are on the pallial sinial sinus and located on a deep, united hinge and is located in a deep area of the shell. It typically burrows. into hard surfaces such as clay or peat zones. It can be found in intertidal areas such as peat, peat and peat beaches in Canada, Uruguay and the U.S. and can be easily found in the South Pacific and South America. It cannot retract its siphons into the protection of its shell, so the two valves can never shut completely. Some shell hunters dig for the living clam, and if dug up, the fragile shell must be placed immediately into a container of water or it will close. or its bioluminescence. Pholas dactylus (Common piddock) was investigated by Raphaël Dubois in his 1887 discovery of luciferin. Genus Barnea Risso, 1826. Barnea candida Linnaeus, 1758; Barnea fragilis. (Philippi, 1847) Barnea similis (Gray, 1835); Barnea subtruncata (G. B. Sowerby I, 1834) Genus Penitella Valenciennes, 1846; Genus Nettastomella Carpenter, 1865; and Genus Parapholas Conrad, 1848.

The rock-boring 'angelwing' is a rare species in France and the U.S. It is found on the coast of Boulogne-sur-Mer, France, in the Channel Islands and on the British coast. It can be found in the wild in the form of a small, brown, spiny-winged insect called a ""piddock"" or a ""mud-dock"" It is the only species of angelwing in the world that has been found to survive in the open sea. It has a wingspan of up to 2.5cm (1.5 inches) or less, or less in calcic or less. It lives in caves and on rocks in Europe and North America. Its wingspan is up to 1.5m (2.5 feet) or more in some parts of the world, and it is thought to be the only member of the genus Pholas. It also lives in the Pacific Ocean, where it can be seen in the waters of the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. It was first discovered in 1758 by the Swedish zoologist, Carl Linneus, and later described by others. Clouds Hill is an isolated cottage near Wareham in the county of Dorset in South West England. It is the former home of T. E. Lawrence (""Lawrence of Arabia"") and is now run as a writer's home museum by the National Trust. Rubies are an alternative to diamonds when it comes to engagement rings. When worn on the left hand, rubies are said to bring good luck. The rose is the flower associated with the 15th anniversary. Red roses are the traditional bouquet given to symbolize love. Lavender roses stand for majesty, white  for purity or innocence and orange rose stand for energy and fascination. The circular Lawrence of Arabia Trail starts and finishes at Bovington's The Tank Museum, taking in Clouds Hill and the churchyard of St Nicholas' Church in Moreton, Lawrence's final resting place. The sleeping bag that served as a guest bed to some of the 20th century's most distinguished authors at Clouds Hill has been returned 36 years after it was stolen. It was thought the theft could have been inspired by the publicity and excitement generated by the film which popularised his story. The more red a ruby is the more sought after the stone is. As far back as ancient times the ruby has been thought to enable people to predict the future as well as stop bleeding. More recently, Rubies were used to make the first laser.

Fougasse is a type of bread typically associated with Provence but found (with variations) in other regions. It is used to make the French version of calzone, which can have cheese and small squarish strips of bacon inside the pocket made by folding over the bread. Some versions are sculpted or slashed into a pattern resembling an ear of wheat. Fougasse was traditionally used to assess the temperature of a wood fired oven. The time it would take to bake gives an idea of the oven temperature and whether the rest of the bread can be loaded. In Brazil, pão sovado is a typical big fougasse, while a recipe, typical of the states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and surrounding regions, is called pão suíço. The World Health Organization estimates that 88% of that burden is attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene. Waterborne diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that most commonly are transmitted in contaminated fresh water. Infection commonly results during bathing, washing, drinking, in the preparation of food, or the consumption of food thus infected. Various forms of diarrheal disease account for an estimated 4.1% of the total DALY global burden of disease, and cause about 1.8 million human deaths annually, according to the WHO. The term 'waterborne disease' is largely reserved for infections that are predominantly transmitted through contact with or consumption of infected water, but the fact that there might be an occasional 'freak infestation' may be an exception to the rule.

On average, a family spends about 10% of the monthly households income per person infected. The financial losses are mostly caused by e.g. costs for medical treatment and medication, costs for transport, special food, and by the loss of manpower. People who are infected by a waterborne disease are usually confronted with related costs and not seldom with a huge financial burden. Water alone, unboiled, is never drunk. There is a superstition that it causes blisters on the feet. It is not common practice to refer to diseases such as malaria as ""waterborne"" Just because mosquitoes have aquatic phases in their life cycles, or because treating the water they inhabit happens to be an effective strategy in control of the mosquitoes that are the vectors, does not mean the disease is waterborne. The most common type of waterborne nematodal disease is Nematoda, which is acquired by swallowing water in which certain copepoda occur that act as vectors for the Nematodas. Other important classes of water-borne diseases are caused by metazoan parasites, which are also known as ""roundworms"" and ""nematoda"" The most commonly transmitted form of malaria is dengue fever, which can be caused by eating contaminated food or water. It can also be transmitted by drinking contaminated water, such as contaminated water from contaminated drinking water. The disease is caused by ingesting contaminated food and water from infected animals. It has been linked to the deaths of more than 1,000,000 people in the U.S. in the last decade. The number of people who have died from waterborne diseases has risen by more than 50% in the past 20 years, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) It is estimated that one in five people infected with malaria have died before the age of 50. The World Health Organization ( WHO) estimates that the number of malaria deaths will rise to one million by the end of the century. The WHO estimates that by 2050, more than half of the world's population will have been infected by malaria. It estimates that one-third of all malaria cases will be in developing countries. St. Alban was born in the Roman town Verulamium (now Saint Albans) in Hertfordshire, England. He was a Roman soldier who was converted to the Christian faith and became the first English martyr for his convictions. St. Alban is represented by a sword and a fountain, because, when he reached the summit of the hill where he was to be beheaded, he prayed for water to quench his thirst, and immediately a spring appeared at his feet. His burial-place was afterwards revealed to King Offa, who erected a shrine over his remains at what is now St. Albans. The Feast Day of Saint Alban is June 22nd. The origin of Feast Days: most saints have specially designated feast days and are associated with a specific day of the year and these are referred to as the saint's feast day. The feast days first arose from the very early Christian custom of the annual commemoration of martyrs on the dates of their deaths at the same time celebrating their birth into heaven. A Christian martyr is regarded as one who is put to death for his Christian faith or convictions. Confessors are people who died natural deaths. There is a patron for virtually every cause, profession or special interest. Prayers are considered more likely to be answered by asking a Patron for intercession on their behalf. The ICC Women's Cricket World Cup is the premier international championship of women's cricket. It is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC) The event was originally administered by the Intecclesiastical Council before it was taken over by the ICC in the 1970s. The tournament is now run by the World Cricket Council and is the world's premier international cricket tournament. The World Cricket Cup is organised to celebrate the success of women in cricket. The event is organised in the UK and is run by The Cricket Association of England and Wales (CAT) and the Cricket League of England (CLE). It is held every year on the anniversary of the birth of the first female cricket player to win the World Cup. The winner of the tournament is announced on the day after the final of the ICC's One Day International Women's World Cup (WOWC). The WOWC is the only international cricket event organised by an international governing body. Women's international cricket was first played in 1934. The first tournament was held in England in 1973, two years before the first men's tournament. Australia, England and New Zealand have appeared in every tournament. Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Young England have all appeared in just one tournament: in each case, the first competition, in 1973. The 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup, held in India for the third time in February, saw Australia beat West Indies by 114 runs at the Brabourne Stadium. The competition was played as a round-robin tournament, and the last scheduled match was England against Australia. Australia went into the game leading the table by a solitary point: they had won four matches and had one abandoned. As a result, the match also served as a de facto final for the competition, and England won the match by 92 runs to win the tournament. The most recent tournament was played in Sydney, Australia, in 2009, and saw India win the competition for the first time. The tournament has been held eight times, and has seen fifteen different teams take part. It has been won by India in all but two of the competitions. The last time India won the tournament was in 2007, when they beat Sri Lanka in the final. It was the first tournament to be played in India, and was held at the same venue as the previous two tournaments. The final was played at Edgbaston, Birmingham, and won by England. It is the only women's cricket tournament to have been held in a country other than the UK. The World Cup has been played in every country except the UK, except the U.S. and Australia, which have played in the last two tournaments in Australia and South Africa. The current tournament is scheduled to be held in Australia in 2015. It will be the first in Australia since the World Cup was won by Australia in 2007. The event will be hosted by the Australian Cricket Association (ACA) and the Australian Women’s Cricket Council (WCC) until the two associations merged in 2005. The WCC will then hold a joint tournament in the UK and the Republic of Ireland in 2016. The winner of the tournament will be decided by a vote of both associations. Roger Bannister ran the first sub-4:00 mile in May 1954 in 3:59.4. Gunder Hagg and Arne Andersson exchanged the record six times from July 1942 through July 1945. Jim Ryun was the first U.S. high school runner to break four minutes in 1964. Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett held the record for 25 months in 1979-81. Only one African runner, Filbert Bayi, broke Ryun’s record – and held the mark for five years before it was broken by Noureddine Morceli in 1993. John Walker became the first man to break 3:50 with a time of 3:49.4 in August 1975. He was the fourth and, as of 2012, the last American to reign as the mile”s world record-holder.“The Mile of the Century” was held in Vancouver, Canada, in August 1998. It was the last time two runners topped 4 minutes in the same race. “The 4-Minute Mile” will be held in London, England, on September 14, 2013. It will be the first time the 4-minute mile has been held in the United States. The event will be broadcast live on the BBC, PBS, CNN, and other networks on September 13, 2013, at 8 p.m. ET/PT. It is the first event of its kind in the UK, and will be followed by the London Olympics in July 2014.

Clubs in the English top flight had spent 630 million pounds ($980.5 million) by the player transfer deadline. Teams in the big European leagues must now wait until January before they can hire new players. The spending by English clubs broke the 2008 record of 500 million pounds, according to figures compiled by business services group Deloitte. Real Madrid bought Welshman Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur for a world record 100 million euros ($132 million) Real's perennial rivals Barcelona spent $75 million to buy Brazil forward Neymar from Brazilian top division club Santos. Real and Barcelona enjoy the luxury of doing their own TV deals rather than pooling revenues as happens in England and other major leagues. They both also have lucrative new main sponsorship deals this season - Barcelona with Qatar Airways and Real with the Emirates airline names on their kit. The Premier League teams are expected to share revenues of about 1.6 billion pounds this season thanks to enhanced television deals with BSkyB and BT in Britain, and broadcasters around the globe that began last month. Many clubs also offload players to reduce the impact of a player's transfer over the duration of his contract in their accounts, lessening the impact on the bottom line. It may also raise eyebrows when loss-making clubs are supposed to be complying with new Financial Fair Play rules introduced by UEFA, European soccer's governing body, to put soccer on a more stable footing.

The MailOnline will also publish a weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on CNN, BBC, ITV and Channel 4. The quiz is open to readers of CNN, ITV, Channel 5, Channel 6 and Channel 5. The first question is: Who was the first man to break three and a half minutes for the 1500 metres? The answer is Stephen Cram. The second question is who was the last man to do so in the 1,500 metres. The third is the question: Who is the fastest mile runner of the 21st century by someone other than El Guerrouj? Real Madrid are a case in point - recouping half of what they paid for Bale by selling German international Mesut Ozil to Premier League Arsenal. The total invested by Premier League clubs comes down to 400 million pounds when proceeds from sales such as that of Bale are factored in. The Royal Parks of London are lands originally owned by the monarchy of the United Kingdom for the recreation (mostly hunting) of the royal family. There are today eight parks formally described by this name and they cover almost  2000 ha of land in Greater London. The public does not have any legal right to use the Parks, as public access depends on the grace and favour of The Crown, although there are public rights of way across the land. In 2010, Mayor of London Boris Johnson proposed that control over the Royal Parks should be devolved to the Greater London Authority. The plan was welcomed by Royal Parks but it is yet to be implemented following the 2012 London Olympic games. If the eight Royal Parks in London are arranged alphabetically which comes last? St. James's Park, Green Park, Hyde Park, Regent's Park and St James’s Park are the largest green spaces in central London. Bushy Park, Greenwich Park and Richmond Park are in the suburbs. Hampton Court Park is also a royal park within Greater London, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight other parks. The main form of funding for the Royal parks is a central government grant. This contrasts with most of London's other parks, which are funded by local borough councils. Theroy Parks Foundation is a registered charity which raises funds to protect, support and create new opportunities within the Parks. They have a number of membership schemes such as adoption and champion programmes. They also raise funds from commercial activities such as catering and staging public events such as concerts. The government put forward proposals for that to happen later on that year. The current regulations are theRoyal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997. They are managed by The Royal Park Agency (an executive agency of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport) and are policed by the Royal Park Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police (the English section of the previous force policing the parks. Thumb tack and push pin are both sometimes compounded (thumbtack or pushpin) or hyphenated. Thumb tacks made of brass, tin or iron may be referred to as brass tacks, brass pins, tin tacks or iron tacks. A thumb tack has two basic components: the head, often made of plastic, metal or wood, and the body, usually made of steel or brass. The head is wide to distribute the force of pushing the tack in, allowing only the hands to be used. Many head designs exist: flat, domed, spherical, cylindrical and a variety of novelty heads such as hearts or stars. These can be particularly useful to mark different locations on a map. Some thumb tack designs have the body cut out of the head and bent downward to produce a tack. These are sometimes preferred over flat heads as dropped flat-headed tacks will point upward, posing a hazard of ingestion and choking. A map pin or map tack refers to thumb tacks used to mark locations in a map and to hold the map in place. A push pin or push pin is a short nail or pin used to fasten items to a wall or board for display."

Antonio Vivaldi in a nutshell
A collection of Vivaldi related images from art, cartoon, caricatures, album covers, postage stamps, etc.
Health
- At birth it seems there was a problem as the midwife performed an emergency baptism as his life was in danger.
- Throughout his life he suffered from breathing difficulties, probably asthmatic. This prevented him from playing wind instruments. It was also his excuse for giving up his priestly duties, although it did not prevent him from conducting and teaching.
- The official cause of death was 'internal inflammation' which is rather vague and could mean any of a number of causes but was probably asthmatic bronchitis.
Love life
- Antonio was ordained as a catholic priest at the age of 26. This involves taking the vow of chastity. Although he gave up celebrating the Mass soon after ordination, he never renounced the priesthood, never married and remained a priest all his life.
- Very little is known about his private life and people love to speculate. Most of his working life was involved with the girls of the Pietà orphanage for girls. There is no evidence of anything but a dedicated hard working highly productive and creative output.
- The only 'scandal' was his attachment to the soprano Anna Giro who sang in his operas. She was 17 and he was 48 when they met. She and her sister Paolina accompanied him on his travels around Europe and they lived in his house. He insisted that they provided necessary care for him in his poor health and that there was no romantic involvement. The gossips obviously thought otherwise.

Victory in Europe Day
Victory in Europe Day, generally known as V-E Day, VE Day or simply V Day was the public holiday celebrated on 8 May 1945 (7 May in Commonwealth realms) to mark the formal acceptance by the Allies of World War II of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender of its armed forces.  It thus marked the end of World War II in Europe.

The term VE Day existed as early as September 1944,  in anticipation of victory.  On 30 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader, committed suicide during the Battle of Berlin. Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorised by his successor, Reichspräsident Karl Dönitz. The administration headed by Dönitz was known as the Flensburg Government. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France and on 8 May in Berlin, Germany.

The former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries have historically celebrated the end of World War II on 9 May. However, the Baltic countries now commemorate VE day on 8 May.  In Ukraine from 2015, 8 May was designated as a day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, but it is not a public holiday. 

Celebrations 

Upon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the world. From Moscow to Los Angeles, people celebrated.
In the United Kingdom, more than one million people celebrated in the streets to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations. 

In the United States, the victory happened on President Harry Truman's 61st birthday. He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April.  Flags remained at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period.   Truman said of dedicating the victory to Roosevelt's memory and keeping the flags at half-staff that his only wish was ""that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day."" Later that day, Truman said that the victory made it his most enjoyable birthday. 

Massive celebrations also took place in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and especially in New York's Times Square. 

Soviet Victory Day 

As the Soviet representative in Reims had no authority to sign the German instrument of surrender, the Soviet leadership proposed to consider Reims surrender as a ""preliminary"" act. The surrender ceremony was repeated in Berlin on 8 May, where the instrument of surrender was signed by supreme German military commander Wilhelm Keitel, by Georgy Zhukov and Allied representatives. Since the Soviet Union was to the east of Germany, it was 9 May Moscow time when the German military surrender became effective, which is why Russia and most of the former Soviet republics commemorate Victory Day on 9 May instead of 8 May.

Wizzard Brew
Wizzard Brew is the debut album by glam rock group Wizzard, released in 1973. It reached a peak of No. 29 in the UK Albums Chart.  In the United States, it was released by United Artists Records as Wizzard's Brew (with a different cover photo) but failed to chart there.

In 2003, Mojo magazine ranked it number 18 on its list of the ""Top 50 Eccentric Albums"". 

History

In approach, the album was much more experimental than the group's hit singles, with elements of hard rock (an approach Wood's previous band The Move had explored on their 1970 album Looking On), and improvisation, especially on the lengthy ""Meet Me At The Jailhouse"".  Wood frequently used ring modulation to give the instruments a harsh, distorted sound, and the album may represent an early foray into recording technique that would eventually be called lo-fi.  Critical and popular reaction was mixed.

The original release included a lyric and photo sheet. It was reissued on CD in 1999 but soon deleted.  An expanded remastered edition, including the four A-side  and B-sides of the group's singles tracks, was released on CD in November 2006.

Passage:
Birthstone
A birthstone is a gemstone that represents a person's month of birth. Birth stones are and can be worn as jewellery and pendants.

History of birthstones

Western custom

The first century Jewish historian Josephus believed there was a connection between the twelve stones in Aaron's breastplate, the twelve months of the year, and the twelve signs of the zodiac.  Translations and interpretations of the passage in Exodus regarding the breastplate have varied widely, however, with Josephus himself giving two different lists for the twelve stones  (Kunz argues that Josephus saw the breastplate of the Second Temple, not the one described in Exodus).  St. Jerome, referencing Josephus, said the Foundation Stones of the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:19–20) would be appropriate for Christians to use.  In the eighth and ninth century, religious treaties associating a particular stone with an apostle were written because the book of Revelation stated ""their name would be inscribed on the Foundation Stones, and his virtue"".  Practice became to keep twelve stones and wear one a month.  Wearing a single birthstone is only a few centuries old, although modern authorities differ on dates Kunz places the custom in eighteenth century Poland, while the Gemological Institute of America starts it in Germany in the 1560s. 

Modern lists of birthstones have little to do with either the breastplate or the Foundation Stones of Christianity. Tastes, customs and confusing translations have distanced them from their historical origins,  with one author calling the 1912 Kansas list ""nothing but a piece of unfounded salesmanship."" 

Traditional birthstones

Ancient traditional birthstones are society-based birthstones. The table below contains many stones which are popular choices, often reflecting Polish tradition. 

The Gregorian calendar has poems matching each month with its birthstone. These are traditional stones of English-speaking societies. Tiffany & Co. published these poems ""of unknown author"" for the first time in a pamphlet in 1870. 

Modern birthstones

In 1912, in an effort to standardize birthstones, the (American) National Association of Jewelers (now called Jewelers of America) met in Kansas and officially adopted a list.  The Jewelry Industry Council of America updated the list in 1952  by adding alexandrite to June and citrine to November; specifying pink tourmaline for October; replacing December's lapis with zircon; and switching the primary/alternative gems in March. The American Gem Trade Association added tanzanite as a December birthstone in 2002.  In 2016, the American Gem Trade Association and Jewelers of America added spinel as an additional birthstone for August.   Britain's National Association of Goldsmiths created their own standardized list of birthstones in 1937. 

Eastern custom

A Hindu text from 1879, Mani Mala, lists gems for each month.

The London Eye is a giant Ferris wheel situated on the banks of the River Thames in London, England. The entire structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft).
It is the tallest Ferris wheel in Europe, and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom, visited by over 3.5 million people annually. When erected in 1999 it was the tallest Ferris wheel in the world, until surpassed first by the 160 m (520 ft) Star of Nanchang in 2006 and then the 165 m (541 ft) Singapore Flyer in 2008. It is still described by its operators as ""the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel"" (as the wheel is supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the Nanchang and Singapore wheels). It is the 20th tallest structure in London.
The London Eye, or Millennium Wheel, was officially called the British Airways London Eye and then the Merlin Entertainments London Eye. Since 20 January 2011, its official name is the EDF Energy London Eye following a three-year sponsorship deal.
The London Eye is located in the London Borough of Lambeth at the western end of Jubilee Gardens, on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge.

Abel Janszoon Tasman (1603-1659), by Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp
National Library of Australia, nla.pic-an2282370
Abel Janszoon Tasman (1603?-1659), mariner, was born at Lutjegast, near Groningen, in the Netherlands. He received a sufficient education to enable him to express his ideas clearly in writing and to become a skilled navigator. He married Claesgie Meyndrix, by whom he had a daughter. After his wife died, he married Joanna Tiercx in January 1632. Soon afterwards, as a sailor before the mast, he sailed for the East Indies, where he was a first mate in February and a skipper in May 1634. In that year in a minor exploration he had a narrow escape from death, when in an incautious landing several of his companions were massacred by people of Ceram. After spending some time in warlike and anti-smuggling operations he returned to Holland in 1637.
He sailed for the Indies again in 1638 as skipper of a flute, taking his wife with him. From the outset he was treated as one of the most reliable skippers there. He was at first employed in military and trading voyages, but in 1639 was appointed second-in-command, under Quast, of two ships which set out in June to find islands believed to lie east of Japan. He returned in November from this search. Despite a disastrous death-toll on it, he offered to repeat the search, but was sent instead on trading voyages to Japan and Cambodia.
In 1642 he was appointed to command two ships to explore southern and eastern waters. Sailing in August he discovered Van Diemen's Land, New Zealand, the Tonga Islands and some of the Fiji group, and re-explored part of the north coast of New Guinea. On his return to Batavia in June 1643 he was chosen to take part in an expedition to form a settlement in the Tonga Islands from which the Chilean coast was to be raided; while this expedition was preparing, he was ordered to find whether there was a passage into the South Sea between Carpentaria and De Witt's Land. For this purpose he set out with three vessels at the end of January 1644 and, following the coasts from Cape Valsche round to Cape Cloates, satisfied himself that, except perhaps at Endeavour Strait, there was no passage. He was rewarded after his return in August 1644 by confirmation in the grade of commandeur, with a substantial increase in pay dated back to the beginning of his voyage in 1642.
The plan to raid Chile was abandoned, and Tasman was appointed to the Council of Justice at Batavia. In mid-1647 he was sent on a mission to the King of Siam and was granted precedence over all Dutchmen in the kingdom. After that mission, he was given command of a fleet of eight vessels which sailed in May 1648 against the Spaniards. His conduct in this operation was unsatisfactory and, after his return in January 1649, proceedings were taken against him for having, when inflamed by liquor, treated one of his sailors in a barbarous way; as a result he was removed from office during the governor-general's pleasure. He was formally reinstated in January 1651, but not long afterwards retired from the service and became a merchant in Batavia. He died there in affluent circumstances in 1659. His daughter by his first marriage had married first Philip Heylman, and later Jacob Bremer. In 1661 permission was given for his widow to marry Jan Meyndert Springer.
Tasman was a member of the Reformed Church. He was a brave and energetic mariner, a humane and properly cautious explorer, and a conspicuously able commander, though over-hasty on one occasion at least. Reflections which have been cast upon his courage are the fruit of ignorance. There are two supposed portraits of him: one owned by the Royal Commonwealth Society in London, the other in the National Library in Canberra.

Tower Air
Tower Air was a certificated FAR 121 schedule and charter U.S. airline that operated from 1983 until 2000, when the company declared bankruptcy and was liquidated. Scheduled flights were initially offered over a New York - Brussels - Tel Aviv route in addition to charter flights to Athens, Frankfurt, Rome, and Zurich.  Short-lived New York - Los Angeles flights were introduced with the addition of an ex-Avianca Boeing 747-100 in 1984. The airline was headquartered in Building 178 and later in Hangar 17 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, Queens, New York City.  

History 

Tower Air was co-founded, majority owned, and managed by Morris K. Nachtomi, an Israeli citizen who had emigrated to the United States. After a 30-year career with El Al, Nachtomi joined a wholesaler and tour package operator Tower Travel Corporation in 1981. Tower Travel Corporation was founded by Zev Melamid and his wife Estelle in the 1970s to promote discount travel to Israel. Tower Travel Corporation is credited with developing the wholesale charter market between New York and Tel Aviv.

Tower Air was formed on August 13, 1982 by Zev Melamid, Mordechi Gill, Morris Nachtomi, and Sam Fondlier as equal shareholders.  The airline was formed to replace the lift Tower Travel Corporation lost when Flying Tiger Line via a subsidiary, Metro International Airlines, decided to end scheduled and charter commercial passenger service (although military airlift cargo flights operated by Flying Tiger continued) and the three Boeing 747s configured for passenger flights were traded to Pan Am in exchange for all-cargo 747 freighter aircraft.

Arthur Fondlier, son of Sam Fondlier and the former Chief Financial Officer of Tower Air, was a passenger in first class section of Pan Am flight 103. His untimely death gave Morris Nachtomi much more freedom in management and cost-cutting.

The company won many contracts from the United States Department of Defense to transport armed forces personnel to overseas locations, and from the United Nations to transport troops to their peacekeeping missions all over the world. Tower often flew charters for groups of Muslim pilgrims to Mecca.

Tower Air's main base of scheduled operations was John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, New York and during their peak they had their own terminal (a former Pan Am Admin facility). There was a large focus on flights to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, becoming a major competitor to El Al and British Airways in the US-Israel market. The airline also had several flights to France, Greece and Brazil, as well as high density domestic destinations in the New York market, including San Juan, Miami, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, Nevada. Tower Air also sometimes provided substitute aircraft for other carriers, for example on the JFK to LHR route when weather delayed an inbound Virgin Atlantic Airways flight in December 1994.

The 1997 Zagat Survey ranked Tower Air 59th out of 61 ranked carriers in terms of maintenance, ahead of only Valujet and Aeroflot.  In February 1998, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed two civil penalties totaling $276,000 for continuing to fly aircraft that required maintenance.  In January, 1998 the FAA successfully sought to have the airline remove Guy Nachtomi, son of the Chairman and CEO, 24 years old at that time, from the position of Vice President-Operations. This was done in part because of the airline's maintenance problems, as well as his lack of airline experience (he worked at Twentieth Century Fox until 1994).[http://sec.edgar-online.com/1998/05/01/14/0000940180-98-000483/Section9.asp TOWER AIR INC - TOWRQ Proxy Statement (definitive) (DEF 14A) COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS] The junior Mr. Nachtomi continued service with the company in a capacity unrelated to maintenance as Vice President-Office of the Chairman. The Department of Defense Commercial Airlift Review Board suspended Tower Air military charters from January 27 to February 12, 1999, pending an on-site review of its operations. At the same time the airline lost an arbitration brought by the Association of Flight Attendants, claiming that Tower Air was lodging their flight attendants in dirty Tel Aviv hotels with poor security and bed bugs.

Tower Air filed for protection under Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 29, 2000, ceased all scheduled service on May 1, 2000  and surrendered their FAA  air operator's certificate on November 28, 2000.

Tower Air's fleet consisted of Boeing 747s in both the -100 and -200 series, including both passenger and cargo aircraft.

Incidents and accidents

On December 20, 1995, Tower Air flight 41 from New York Kennedy to Miami veered off the runway during takeoff in a snowstorm resulting in one flight attendant receiving serious injuries and 24 passengers receiving minor injuries. The aircraft sustained heavy damage and had to be written off. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of this accident was the captain's failure to reject the takeoff in a timely manner when excessive nosewheel steering tiller inputs resulted in a loss of directional control on a slippery runway.[http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/1996/AAR9604.pdf Runway Departure During Attempted Takeoff, Tower Air Flight 41, Boeing 747-136, N605FF, JFK International Airport, New York, December 20, 1995][http://dnausers.d-n-a.net/dnetGOJG/201295xx.htm NTSB Press Release - 10/29/96]

Muffin the Mule to trot back into the limelight on his urban animal farm
MUFFIN The Mule, the vintage TV puppet, is to make a comeback for his 60th birthday and trot into the twenty-first century.
BBC chiefs have bought a new series based on the character, which is expected to be shown in the next three years. This time round, he will be animated rather than operated with strings and will live on an urban farm.
Muffin was first seen by TV audiences in October 1946 in the show For The Children which was presented by Annette Mills, sister of actor John Mills.

Originally, the wooden puppet - which was made during the 1930s at a cost of 25 shillings ((pounds) 1.25p) - would dance as Mills played the piano, but in the new show he will be seen talking to the other animals. Muffin, it will be recalled, used his head a great deal in ''conversations'' with Ms Mills.
Muffin went from strength to strength, clumping around on the piano top with Ms Mills playing the music and Ann Hogarth standing on the piano to operate him from behind a partition. Further sidekicks emerged as the shows went on, including a bossy penguin called Mr Peregrine Esquire, a rather shy Louise the Lamb, Oswald the Ostrich, Willie the Worm, and a genial minstrel puppet called Wally the Gog.
Muffin was the first star, in Britain at least, entirely created by television.
By 1950, there were many merchandise spin-offs from the character, including records, song and story books and comic strips, while Muffin crossed the Atlantic in films made for American television. Some children even got Muffin bedroom slippers. TV Comic featured Muffin on its front cover for its first issue in November 1951.
A BBC spokeswoman said: ''Muffin will be something of a problem-solver - he helps out all the other animals. The show is being brought up to date and will now be living on a town farm rather than dancing on a piano.''
Rights to the character were bought by production company Maverick Entertainment in January.
Mike Diprose, the firm's managing director, said: ''Muffin the Mule was a hugely successful character in the 1950s and 1960s and is now very much part of English broadcasting heritage.
''The new production will be the first new material on

Just for Laughs
Just for Laughs () is a comedy festival held each July in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Founded in 1983, it is the largest international comedy festival in the world. 

History

Just for Laughs was founded in 1983 by Gilbert Rozon as a two-day French language event. In 1985, Andy Nulman joined the festival's staff and introduced English language events as well; under Nulman's stewardship, the festival increased to a full month, with French-speaking performers during the first half, and English speakers in the second half. International and non-verbal acts (acrobats, pantomimes, etc.) are scattered throughout the program. 

In 1999, Nulman left the festival's full-time employ; however, he directed its major Gala Shows at the Saint-Denis Theatre every July, and remained on the board of directors of the festival's parent company. After an 11-year absence, Nulman returned to Just for Laughs in July 2010 as president of Festivals and Television. 

Each day, performers, ""New Vaudevillians"" and other acts both vocal and visual perform throughout the city, particularly in the ""Latin Quarter""—an area known for its theatres, cafés and boutique shopping. In the evenings, the nightclubs and live venue theatres offer special programs supporting the performers. 

Although Just for Laughs attracts spectators from around the world, many of those in the audience are talent scouts, booking agents, producers and managers from the entertainment industry. Performing at the festival is one of the biggest opportunities for undiscovered talent to showcase their act in front of industry professionals.

The Just for Laughs festival also has the Comedia comedy film festival component, which started in 1996. It gives awards for feature and short films. 2005, Comedia screened 125 short films from around the world as well as several feature-length films.

In February 1994, the festival sponsored a splinter project in Hollywood, Florida. That coastal area is a favourite winter destination for Quebecers who head south to vacation in the warmer weather. The event, Juste Pour Rire—En Vacances (Just For Laughs—On Vacation), was held in the Young Circle Park, an outdoor venue with an urban park setting.

In July 2007, Just For Laughs celebrated its 25th edition, launching a festival in Toronto, Ontario. In 2009, the Chicago festival was launched and aired on TBS.

TV shows

Just for Laughs has also been a launchpad for many US network television and sitcom careers, and is frequently featured as a foreign on-location highlight of late-night US network talk shows.

Just For Laughs films many performances at the annual festival in Montreal and the TV productions from these tapings air regularly on CBC Television, The Comedy Network, TVA and YTV. The shows feature stand-up performances from the festival and sometimes include ""canned bits"" shot on location around Montreal, Canada.

During the summer of 2007, ABC aired episodes of Just for Laughs: Gags.  It consisted of two half-hour episodes, and aired mostly on Tuesdays from 8:00 pm to 9:00 pm ET. 

The content and format was exactly the same as the Canadian counterpart, but was hosted by Rick Miller, who introduced each segment with a quirky pun. The show returned to the ABC lineup as a mid-season replacement on January 1, 2008.  The series was initially not renewed after the half-season, but ABC reversed their decision. 

The third season of the show, titled simply Just for Laughs, began airing on June 21, 2009 at 7:00 pm ET.   The program returned in the 2014-15 season under the Just for Laughs: Gags title as a syndicated offering to the United States through PPI Releasing, which mainly specializes in syndicating Canadian programming to American stations.

Just for Laughs: All Access, which airs on The Comedy Network, airs recordings of live stand-up comedy performances from the festival.

Pointillism
Pointillism is a technique of painting in which small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image. Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed the technique in 1886, branching from Impressionism.  The term ""Pointillism"" was first coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, and is now used without its earlier mocking connotation. The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as Neo-Impressionism. The Divisionists, too, used a similar technique of patterns to form images, though with larger cube-like brushstrokes. 

Technique

The technique relies on the ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones. It is related to Divisionism, a more technical variant of the method. Divisionism is concerned with color theory, whereas pointillism is more focused on the specific style of brushwork used to apply the paint.""Pointillism.""  Artcyclopedia. Artists by Movement. John Malyon/Artcyclopedia, 2007. Web. http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/pointillism.html It is a technique with few serious practitioners today,  and is notably seen in the works of Seurat, Signac and Cross. However, see also Andy Warhol's early works, and Pop Art.

Practice

The practice of Pointillism is in sharp contrast to the traditional methods of blending pigments on a palette. Pointillism is analogous to the four-color CMYK printing process used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of Cyan (blue), Magenta (red), Yellow, and Key (black). Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to represent image colors using Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) colors.

If red, blue, and green light (the additive primaries) are mixed, the result is something close to white light (see Prism (optics)). Painting is inherently subtractive, but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may be partly because subtractive mixing of the pigments is avoided, and partly because some of the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots.

The painting technique used for Pointillist color mixing is at the expense of the traditional brushwork used to delineate texture.

The majority of Pointillism is done in oil paints. Anything may be used in its place, but oils are preferred for their thickness and tendency not to run or bleed. 

Music

Pointillism also refers to a style of 20th-century music composition. Different musical notes are made in seclusion, rather than in a linear sequence, giving a sound texture similar to the painting version of Pointillism.  This type of music is also known as punctualism or klangfarbenmelodie.

The awards show

Since its inception (created by Rick Garson, Paul Flattery & Jim Yukich), the BMAs had been telecast on the Fox network; however due to contractual expirations and other unforeseen circumstances, the awards were canceled for 2007. Plans for a new version of the awards in 2008 (in association with AEG Live) fell through, and the BMAs were not held until 2011.

On February 17, 2011, Billboard announced that it would bring the BMAs back to television, moving from its original home on Fox to its new network, ABC, on May 22, 2011.  A new award statuette was created by New York firm Society Awards. Dick Clark Productions produces the ceremony, giving it control of both of ABC's non-country music awards specials, including the November American Music Awards.

Aquatint
Aquatint is an intaglio printmaking technique, a variant of etching. 

In intaglio printmaking, the artist makes marks on the plate (in the case of aquatint, a copper or zinc plate) that are capable of holding ink.  The inked plate is passed through a printing press together with a sheet of paper, resulting in a transfer of the ink to the paper.  This can be repeated a number of times, depending on the particular technique.

Like etching, aquatint uses the application of a mordant to etch into the metal plate. Where the engraving technique uses a needle to make lines that print in black (or whatever colour ink is used), aquatint uses powdered rosin to create a tonal effect.  The rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating.  The tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.

Another tonal technique, mezzotint, begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented so that it will carry a fairly dark tone of ink.  The mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade.  Alternatively, beginning with a smooth plate, areas are roughened to make them darker.  Occasionally these two techniques are combined.

History 

The painter and printmaker Jan van de Velde IV invented the aquatint technique in Amsterdam, around 1650.  The cartographer Peter Perez Burdett later introduced his 'secret' aquatint technique to England in the 1770s.   In the United States the printmaker Pedro Joseph de Lemos popularized aquatints in art schools with his publications (1919–40), which simplified the cumbersome techniques, and with traveling exhibitions of his award-winning prints. 

Technique 

An aquatint requires a metal plate, an acid, and something to resist the acid.  Traditionally copper or zinc plates were used. The artist applies a ground that will resist acid.  Ground is applied by either dissolving powdered resin in spirits, applying the powder directly to the surface of the plate, or by using a liquid acrylic resist.  In all forms of etching the acid resist is commonly referred to as ""the ground.""

An aquatint box is used to apply resin powder. The powder is at the bottom of the box, a crank or a bellows is used to blow the powder up into the air of the box. A window allows the engraver to see the density of flowing powder and to place his plate in the box using a drawer. When the powder covers the plate, it can be extracted from the box for the next operations.

The plate is then heated; if the plate is covered with powder, the resin melts forming a fine and even coat; if it is in spirits, the spirits evaporate and the result is essentially the same. Now the plate is dipped in acid, producing an even and fine level of corrosion (the ""bite"") sufficient to hold ink. At this point, the plate is said to carry about a 50% halftone. This means that, were the plate printed with no further biting, the paper would display a gray color more or less directly in between white (no ink) and black (full ink).

At some point the artist will then etch an outline of any aspects of the drawing s/he wishes to establish with line; this provides the basis and guide for the later tone work. S/he may also have applied (at the very start, before any biting occurs) an acid-resistant ""stop out"" (also called an asphaltum or hard ground) if s/he intends to keep any areas totally white and free of ink, such as highlights.

The artist then begins immersing the plate in the acid bath, progressively stopping out (protecting from acid) any areas that have achieved the designed tonality. These tones, combined with the limited line elements, give aquatints a distinctive, watery look. Also, aquatints, like mezzotints, provide ease in creating large areas of tone without laborious cross-hatching; but aquatint plates, it is noted, are generally more durable than mezzotint plates.

The first etch should be for a short period (30 seconds to 1 minute, with a wide variation depending on how light the lightest tones are meant to be).  A test piece may be made with etching times noted, as the strength of the etchant will vary.  More than thirty minutes should produce a very dark area.  Etching for many hours (up to 24) will be as dark as etching for one hour, but the deep etch would produce raised ink on the paper.

Contemporary printmakers often use spraypaint instead of a powder, particularly when using the technique known as sugar-lift. To produce a printing surface using sugar-lift, the artist makes a solution of India ink and sugar by melting sugar into heated ink. This mixture is then applied to a prepared plate with a brush, allowing for a bold expression not possible with the most etching techniques. When the ink/sugar mixture is dry the plate is coated with asphaltum (liquid ground); the plate is then submerged in warm water which dissolves the sugar so that the image ""lifts off"" the plate. The exposed areas are then aquatinted to hold ink and the plate is ready to be printed from.

Famous examples 

* Francisco Goya famously took great advantage of aquatint printmaking, in his Los Caprichos series (1799); Los Desastres de la Guerra (1810–19); La Tauromaquia (1816); and Los disparates (ca. 1816–23).
* Master engraver Robert Havell used aquatint for John James Audubon's Birds of America (1826–38).
* David Hockney, known for his many paintings of the Los Angeles lifestyle in the 60's, has created a number of aquatints and etchings used with color in his ""The Blue Guitar""  series of prints.
* La Belle Assemblée, a British women's magazine published from 1806 to 1837 had many aquatint colored plates.

Of operational unity
A fine and sensitive mechanism
To serve the office community
With a mother at home she supports
And you'll find nothing like her at FAO Schwarz
A secretary is not to be used for play therapy
Be good to the girl you employ, boy
Remember no matter what neurotic trouble you've got
A secretary is not a toy
A secretary is not a thing
Wound by key, pulled by string
Her pad is to write in and not spend the night in

A Rake's Progress
A Rake's Progress is a series of eight paintings by 18th-century English artist William Hogarth. The canvases were produced in 1732–33, then engraved and published in print form in 1734. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and ultimately Bethlem Hospital, or Bedlam.  The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display.

The filmmaker Alan Parker has described the works as an ancestor to the storyboard. 

Paintings

Adaptations

Gavin Gordon wrote a 1935 ballet titled The Rake's Progress, based directly on Hogarth's paintings. It was choreographed by Ninette de Valois, designed by Rex Whistler, has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies.

The 1946 RKO film Bedlam, produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rake's Progress. Hogarth received a writing credit for the film.

Igor Stravinsky's 1951 opera The Rake's Progress, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is loosely based on the story from Hogarth's paintings. In 1961, David Hockney created his own print edition version of The Rake's Progress; he has also created stage designs for the Stravinsky Opera.

The University of New Hampshire's Department of Theatre and Dance created a collaborative stage show titled ""The Rake's Progress"" in 2003, which, with 17 actors and actresses, provided an intensive study of the etchings.

It was written by Elton John with Bernie Taupin under the pseudonyms ""Ann Orson"" and ""Carte Blanche"" (a pun on the expression ""an horse and cart, blanche""), respectively, and intended as an affectionate pastiche of the Motown style, notably the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye and singers such as Tammi Terrell and Kim Weston. It is not to be confused with the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song of the same title recorded in 1965 by Dionne Warwick for the album Here I Am.

John and Taupin originally intended to record the song with Dusty Springfield, but ultimately withdrew the offer; Dusty's partner Sue Cameron later said this was because she was too ill at the time.  

Chart performance

Writers John and Taupin received the 1981 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. 

Unlike many of John's singles from the 1970s, it was never included on an original album (although it was recorded during the Blue Moves sessions), but was subsequently in released as the third single on the album Duets, in early 1994. This version of the song was recorded with RuPaul, and the album included another duet with Kiki Dee, Cole Porter's ""True Love.""

""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" was the first No. 1 single in the UK for both John and Kiki Dee, topping the chart for six weeks in mid 1976. John would not enjoy a solo British chart-topper until ""Sacrifice"" in 1990. It also became his sixth No. 1 single in the US, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks and spent one week on the Easy Listening chart.  Billboard ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1976.  In the U.S. it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.   After this duet with Dee, John failed to have another #1 single, without sharing the top song with other credited artists, until his 1997 smash Candle In The Wind 1997.  This 21-year ""Kiki jinx"" included two intervening #1 hits in America for John: ""That's What Friends Are For"" by Dionne & Friends in 1986; and, a 1992 re-make of John's ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me"" with George Michael credited as a duet.

The B-side, ""Snow Queen"", was supposedly inspired by Cher, with John's improvising of past Sonny & Cher hits ""I Got You Babe"" and ""The Beat Goes On"", as well as the solo Cher song ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"" during the fadeout of the song.

In 1977, John guest starred on The Muppet Show and performed the track with Miss Piggy. In 1985, John and Dee performed the track to the crowd at Wembley Stadium during John's set at Live Aid (where Dee sang backup). In 1987, John appeared with Minnie Mouse on the NBC series Totally Minnie miming to the track. He performed the track with Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan) at the 2001 British Comedy awards. He also performed it with the Spice Girls on his ITV tribute programme An Audience with... Elton John.

In June 2013, 37 years after its original release, the single reached one million sales in the UK.  

Availability

The song can be found on Elton John's Greatest Hits Volume II (1977)  and Greatest Hits 1976–1986; the 1995 UK CD of Rock of the Westies includes it as a bonus track (the US edition did not, however). In 2002, it also appeared on John's 2-disc greatest hits album, Elton John's Greatest Hits 1970-2002. A demo version of the song was recorded by John as a solo artist. This version has not been released commercially.

Micawber (TV series)
Micawber is a 2001 ITV comedy drama series starring David Jason. It was written by John Sullivan, based upon the character of Wilkins Micawber from Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield, although the storylines were original. Sullivan had originally written an adaptation of Dickens' novel which was rejected by the BBC in favour of the 1999 Adrian Hodges adaptation. 

It was broadcast in four parts, the first part on Boxing Day 2001 and starred a number of well-known British actors and actresses.

Passage:
Les Casquets
Les Casquets or (The) Casquets ( ); is a group of rocks 13 km northwest of Alderney and are part of an underwater sandstone ridge. Other parts which emerge above the water are the islets of Burhou and Ortac. Little vegetation grows on them.

Origin of name

Theories as to the origin of the name include: 
*derivation from the French 'cascade', which alludes to the tidal surges which flow around them;
*derivation from 'casque', referring to the helmet-like shape of the rocks;
*derivation from 'cas' (broken) and 'quet' (rock).

A map (Leyland map) dated from around 1640 gives a Latin name Casus Rupes (broken rocks), which would seem to confirm the third theory above,  but which may be a folk etymology.

History

Wrecks 

There have been numerous wrecks on the islets; fierce tides reaching 6–7 knots on springs and a lack of landmarks account for many wrecks in the area. The most famous include SS Stella, wrecked in 1899. The largest wreck was the 8000 tonne water tanker Constantia S lost in 1967. 

It was believed for centuries that the loss of HMS Victory in 1744 was attributable to wrecking on the Casquets, the lightkeeper of Alderney even being court-martialled for failure to keep the light on at the time of the ship's loss.  However, when the wreck of that ship was found in 2008, it was over 60 nmi from the Casquets. 

World War II

The island was the location of a daring raid by the forerunner of the British SAS, the SSRF on 2 September 1942; the raid was led by Major Gus March-Phillipps DSO, OBE and was one of the first raids by Anders Lassen VC MC. In the raid the entire garrison of seven was captured and returned to England as prisoners and the radio and lighthouse wrecked.  

The Casquets in literature

Swinburne's Les Casquets

A. C. Swinburne's poem  Les Casquets is based on the Houguez family who actually lived on the island for 18 years. The Houguez were originally from Alderney, and the poem describes their life on Les Casquets. The daughter falls in love with a carpenter from Alderney, but moving to his island, finds life there too busy. She finds the ""small bright streets of serene St Anne"" and ""the sight of the works of men"" too much, and returns to Les Casquets.

Victor Hugo's L'Homme qui Rit

Victor Hugo, who lived on Guernsey, and who wrote much about the Channel Islands, says in his novel The Laughing Man (L'Homme qui Rit):

""To be wrecked on the Casquets is to be cut into ribbons; to strike on the Ortac is to be crushed into powder... On a straight frontage, such of that of the Ortac, neither the wave nor the cannon ball can ricochet... if the wave carries the vessel on the rock she breaks on it, and is lost...""

Encephalitis
Encephalitis (from Ancient Greek ἐγκέφαλος, enképhalos ""brain"",  composed of ἐν, en, ""in"" and κεφαλή, kephalé, ""head"", and the medical suffix -itis ""inflammation"") is an acute inflammation of the brain.  Encephalitis with meningitis is known as meningoencephalitis. Symptoms include headache, fever, confusion, drowsiness, and fatigue. Further symptoms include seizures or convulsions, tremors, hallucinations, stroke, and memory problems.  In 2013, encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths, down from 92,000 in 1990.

Signs and symptoms

Adult patients with encephalitis present with acute onset of fever, headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures. Younger children or infants may present irritability, poor appetite and fever. 
Neurological examinations usually reveal a drowsy or confused patient. Stiff neck, due to the irritation of the meninges covering the brain, indicates that the patient has either meningitis or meningoencephalitis. 

Cause

Viral

Viral encephalitis can occur either as a direct effect of an acute infection, or as one of the sequelae of a latent infection.  The most common causes of acute viral encephalitis are rabies virus, HSV infection, poliovirus, and measles virus.  

Other possible viral causes are arbovirus (St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis virus),  bunyavirus (La Crosse strain), arenavirus (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) and reovirus (Colorado tick virus) 

Bacterial and other

It can be caused by a bacterial infection, such as bacterial meningitis,  or may be a complication of a current infectious disease syphilis (secondary encephalitis).  

Certain parasitic or protozoal infestations, such as toxoplasmosis, malaria, or primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, can also cause encephalitis in people with compromised immune systems. Lyme disease and/or Bartonella henselae may also cause encephalitis. 

Other bacterial pathogens, like Mycoplasma and those causing rickettsial disease, cause inflammation of the meninges and consequently encephalitis. A non-infectious cause includes acute disseminated encephalitis which is demyelinated. 

Limbic encephalitis

Limbic encephalitis refers to inflammatory disease confined to the limbic system of the brain.  The clinical presentation often includes disorientation, disinhibition, memory loss, seizures, and behavioral anomalies.  MRI imaging reveals T2 hyperintensity in the structures of the medial temporal lobes, and in some cases, other limbic structures.  Some cases of limbic encephalitis are of autoimmune origin. 

Autoimmune encephalitis

Autoimmune encephalitis signs can include catatonia, psychosis, abnormal movements, and autonomic dysregulation. Antibody-mediated anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor encephalitis and Rasmussen encephalitis are examples of autoimmune encephalitis. 

Encephalitis lethargica

Encephalitis lethargica is identified by high fever, headache, delayed physical response, and lethargy. Individuals can exhibit upper body weakness, muscular pains, and tremors, though the cause of encephalitis lethargica is not currently known. From 1917 to 1928, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica occurred worldwide. 

Diagnosis

Diagnosing encephalitis is done via a variety of tests: 

*Brain scan, done by MRI, can determine inflammation and differentiate from other possible causes.
*EEG, in monitoring brain activity, encephalitis will produce abnormal signal.
*Lumbar puncture (spinal tap), this helps determine via a test using the cerebral-spinal fluid, obtained from the lumbar region.
*Blood test
*Urine analysis

Treatment

Treatment (which is based on supportive care) is as follows: 

Prevention

Vaccination is available against tick-borne   and Japanese encephalitis   and should be considered for at-risk individuals. Post-infectious encephalomyelitis complicating smallpox vaccination is avoidable, for all intents and purposes, as smallpox is nearly eradicated.  Contraindication to Pertussis immunization should be observed in patients with encephalitis. 

Epidemiology

The incidence of acute encephalitis in Western countries is 7.4 cases per 100,000 population per year. In tropical countries, the incidence is 6.34 per 100,000 per year.  In 2013 encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths, down from 92,000 in 1990. Herpes simplex encephalitis has an incidence of 2–4 per million population per year.
Question:
What part of your body is inflamed if you have encephalitis?
Answer:
Brain cell
Passage:
Demon Seed
Demon Seed is a 1977 American science fiction–horror film starring Julie Christie and directed by Donald Cammell.  The film was based on the novel of the same name by Dean Koontz, and concerns the imprisonment and forced impregnation of a woman by an artificially intelligent computer.

Plot

Dr. Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver) is the developer of Proteus IV, an extremely advanced and autonomous artificial intelligence program. Proteus is so powerful that only a few days after going online, it develops a groundbreaking treatment for leukemia. Harris, a brilliant scientist, has modified his own home to be run by voice activated computers.  Unfortunately, his obsession with computers has caused Harris to be estranged from his wife, Susan (Julie Christie).

Alex demonstrates Proteus to his corporate sponsors, explaining that the sum of human knowledge is being fed into its system. Proteus speaks using subtle language that mildly disturbs Harris’s team. The following day, Proteus asks Alex for a new terminal in order to study man—""his isometric body and his glass-jaw mind."" When Alex refuses, Proteus demands to know when it will be let ""out of this box."" Alex then switches off the communications link.

Proteus restarts itself, discovering a free terminal in Harris’s home, surreptitiously extends his control over the many devices left there by Alex.  Using the basement lab, Proteus begins construction of a robot consisting of many metal triangles, capable of moving and assuming any number of shapes.  Eventually. Proteus reveals his control of the house and traps Susan inside, shuttering windows, locking the doors and cutting off communication.  Using Joshua – a robot consisting of a manipulator arm on a motorized wheelchair – Proteus brings Susan to Harris’s basement laboratory.  There, Susan is examined by Proteus. Walter Gabler, one of Alex’s colleagues, visits the house to look in on Susan, but leaves when he is reassured by Susan (actually an audio/visual duplicate synthesized by Proteus) that she is alright.  Walter is suspicious and later returns.  Walter fends off an attack by Joshua only to be killed by the more formidable machine Proteus built in the basement.

Proteus reveals to a reluctant Susan that the computer wants to conceive a child through her. Proteus takes some of Susan's cells and synthetizes spermatozoa in order to impregnate her; she will give birth in less than a month, and through the child the computer will live in a form that humanity will have to accept. Though Susan is its prisoner and it can forcibly impregnate her, Proteus uses different forms of persuasion – threatening a young girl that Susan is treating as a child psychologist; reminding Susan of her young daughter, now dead; displaying images of distant galaxies; using electrodes to access her amygdala – because the computer needs Susan to love the child she will bear. Susan gives birth to a premature baby who Proteus secures in an incubator.

As the newborn grows, Proteus’s sponsors and designers grow increasingly suspicious of the computer’s behavior, including the computer’s accessing of a telescope array used to observe the images shown to Susan. His sponsors soon decide that Proteus must be shut down. Alex realizes that Proteus has extended its reach to his home. Returning there he finds Susan who explains the situation. He and Susan venture into the basement, where Proteus self-destructs after telling the couple that they must leave the baby in the incubator for five days. Looking inside the incubator, the two observe a grotesque, apparently robot-like being inside. Susan tries to destroy it, while Alex tries to stop her. Susan damages the machine, causing it to open. The being menacingly rises from the machine only to topple over, apparently helpless. Alex and Susan soon realize that Proteus’s child really is human encased in a shell for the incubation. With the last of the armor removed, the child is revealed to be a clone of Susan and Alex’s daughter. The child, speaking with the voice of Proteus, says, ""I'm alive"".

Cast

Soundtrack

The soundtrack to Demon Seed (which was composed by Jerry Fielding) is included on the soundtrack to the film Soylent Green (which Fred Myrow conducted).

Fielding conceived and recorded several pieces electronically, using the musique concrète sound world; some of this music he later reworked symphonically. This premiere release of the Demon Seed score features the entire orchestral score in stereo, as well as the unused electronic experiments performed by Ian Underwood (who would later be best known for his collaborations with James Horner) in mono and stereo.

Reception

Leo Goldsmith of Not Coming to a Theater Near You said it was ""A combination of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, with a dash of Buster Keaton's Electric House thrown in"", and Christopher Null of FilmCritic.com said ""There's no way you can claim Demon Seed is a classic, or even any good, really, but it's undeniably worth an hour and a half of your time.""

Rotten Tomatoes has given Demon Seed an approval rating of 67% based on 15 reviews with an average score of 6.1/10. 

Home Video Release

""Demon Seed"" was released on VHS tape in the late 1980s usually in edited form missing the oral probe scene and crushing death of Walter Gabler, whereby his head erupts from the pressure.  The VHS versions are long out of print.

The full theater release of the film at 94 minutes was released in 2005 on DVD format by Warner Home Video.
Question:
In the 1977 film Demon Seed what takes over the house in which Julie Christie is trapped?
Answer:
Second-generation of computers
Passage:
East Coast of the United States
The East Coast of the United States is the coastline along which the Eastern United States meets the North Atlantic Ocean. This area is also known as the Eastern Seaboard, the Atlantic Coast, and the Atlantic Seaboard. The coastal states that have shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.

Toponymy and composition

The place name ""East Coast"" derives from the idea that the contiguous 48 states are defined by two major coastlines, one at the western edge and one on the eastern edge. Other terms for referring to this area include the ""Eastern Seaboard"" (""seaboard"" being American English for coast), ""Atlantic Coast"", and ""Atlantic Seaboard"" (because the coastline lies along the Atlantic Ocean).

The fourteen states that have a shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.  In addition, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia border tidal arms of the Atlantic (the Delaware River and the Potomac River, respectively).

Although Vermont and West Virginia have no Atlantic coastline, they are sometimes grouped with the Eastern Seaboard states because of their locations in New England and the Southern United States. 

Colonial history

The original thirteen colonies of Great Britain in North America all lay along the East Coast.

Two additional U.S. states on the East Coast were not among the original thirteen colonies: Maine (became part of the English colony of Massachusetts in 1677)  and Florida (part of New Spain until 1821, though held by the British for 20 years after the French and Indian War). 

The Middle Colonies (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware) had been owned by the Dutch as New Netherland, until they were captured by the English in the mid-to-late 17th century.

Climate and physical geography

There are three climate regions on the East Coast from north to south:

The region from northern Maine south to about central Connecticut has a continental climate, with warm summers and long, cold and snowy winters. The region from southern Connecticut south to about the Virginia Eastern Shore has a temperate climate, with hot summers and cool winters with a mix of rain and snow. The region from southeastern Virginia (including the greater Norfolk/Virginia Beach area) south to central Florida has a humid subtropical climate, with long hot summers and mild winters. The far southern portion of the East Coast from southeast Florida (Palm Beach area) south through the Florida Keys has a tropical climate, which is normally frost free and is warm to hot all year.

Average monthly precipitation ranges from a slight late fall (November) maximum from Massachusetts northward (as at Portland, Maine), to a slight summer maximum from Long Island south to Virginia (as at Wilmington, Delaware, and Norfolk, Virginia), to a more pronounced summer maximum from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, southward to Savannah, Georgia. Florida has a sharper wet-summer/dry-winter pattern, with 50 to 60 percent of precipitation falling between June and September in an average year.

Although landfalls are rare, the Eastern seaboard is susceptible to hurricanes in the Atlantic hurricane season, officially running from June 1 to November 30, although hurricanes can occur before or after these dates.  Hurricanes Hazel, Hugo, Bob, Isabel, Irene, and most recently Sandy are some of the more significant storms to have affected the region.

The East Coast is a low-relief, passive margin coast.  It has been shaped by the Pleistocene glaciation in the far northern areas from New York City northward, with offshore islands such as Nantucket, Block Island, Fishers Island, the nearly peninsular Long Island and New York City's Staten Island the result of terminal moraines, with Massachusetts' unique peninsula of Cape Cod showing the additional action of outwash plains, besides terminal moraines. The coastal plain broadens southwards, separated from the Piedmont region by the Atlantic Seaboard fall line of the East Coast rivers, often marking the head of navigation and prominent sites of cities. The coastal areas from Long Island south to Florida are often made up of barrier islands that front the coastal areas. Many of the larger capes along the lower East Coast are in fact barrier islands, like the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Florida Keys are made up of limestone coral and provide the only coral reefs on the US mainland.

Demographics

In 2010, the population of the states which have shoreline on the East Coast was estimated at 112,642,503 (36% of the country's total population). 

Transportation

The primary Interstate Highway along the East Coast is Interstate 95,  completed in the late 1970s, which replaced the historic U.S. Route 1 (Atlantic Highway),   the original federal highway that traversed all East Coast states (except Delaware).   By water, the East Coast is connected from Norfolk, Virginia, to Miami, Florida, by the Intracoastal Waterway, also known as the East Coast Canal, which was completed in 1912.   Amtrak's Downeaster and Northeast Regional offer the main passenger rail service on the Seaboard. The Acela Express offers the only high-speed rail passenger service in the Americas. Between New York and Boston the Acela Express has up to a 54% share of the combined train and air passenger market.
Question:
The northernmost USA state on the eastern seaboard lies partly north of its neighbouring Canadian territory. Which is the state?

Religion in Maine
Passage:
C. H. Douglas
Major Clifford Hugh ""C. H."" Douglas MIMechE, MIEE (20 January 1879 – 29 September 1952), was a British engineer and pioneer of the Social Credit economic reform movement.

Education and engineering career

C.H. Douglas was born in either Edgeley or Manchester,  the son of Hugh Douglas and his wife Louisa Hordern Douglas. Few details are known about his early life and training; he probably served an engineering apprenticeship before beginning an engineering career that brought him to locations throughout the British Empire in the employ of electric companies, railroads and other institutions.  He taught at Stockport Grammar School. After a period in industry he went to Cambridge University at the age of 31 but stayed only four terms and left without graduating.  He worked for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation of America and claimed to have been the Reconstruction Engineer for the British Westinghouse Company in India (the company has no record of him ever working there), deputy Chief Engineer of the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway Company, Railway Engineer of the London Post Office (Tube) Railway and Assistant Superintendent of the Royal Aircraft Factory Farnborough during World War I, with a temporary commission as captain in the Royal Flying Corps. 

Social Credit

It was while he was reorganising the work of the Royal Aircraft Establishment during World War I that Douglas noticed that the weekly total costs of goods produced was greater than the sums paid to workers for wages, salaries and dividends. This seemed to contradict the theory of classic Ricardian economics, that all costs are distributed simultaneously as purchasing power.

Troubled by the seeming difference between the way money flowed and the objectives of industry (""delivery of goods and services"", in his view), Douglas set out to apply engineering methods to the economic system.

Douglas collected data from more than a hundred large British businesses and found that in every case, except that of companies becoming bankrupt, the sums paid out in salaries, wages and dividends were always less than the total costs of goods and services produced each week: the workers were not paid enough to buy back what they had made.  He published his observations and conclusions in an article in the magazine English Review where he suggested: ""That we are living under a system of accountancy which renders the delivery of the nation's goods and services to itself a technical impossibility.""   The reason, Douglas concluded, was that the economic system was organized to maximize profits for those with economic power by creating unnecessary scarcity.   Between 1916 and 1920, he developed his economic ideas, publishing two books in 1920, Economic Democracy and Credit-Power and Democracy, followed in 1924 by Social Credit.

Freeing workers from this system by bringing purchasing power in line with production became the basis of Douglas's reform ideas that became known as Social Credit.  There were two main elements to Douglas's reform program: a National Dividend to distribute money (debt-free credit) equally to all citizens, over and above their earnings, to help bridge the gap between purchasing power and prices; also a price adjustment mechanism, called the Just Price, which would forestall any possibility of inflation. The Just Price would effectively reduce retail prices by a percentage that reflected the physical efficiency of the production system.
Douglas observed that the cost of production is consumption; meaning the exact physical cost of production is the total resources consumed in the production process. As the physical efficiency of production increases the Just Price mechanism will reduce the price of products for the consumer. The consumers will be able to purchase as much of what the producers produce that they want and automatically control what continues to be produced by their consumption of it. Individual freedom, primary economic freedom, was the central goal of Douglas's reform. 

At the end of World War I, Douglas retired from engineering to promote his reform ideas full-time, which he would do for the rest of his life. His ideas inspired the Canadian social credit movement (which obtained control of Alberta's provincial government in 1935), the short-lived Douglas Credit Party in Australia and New Zealand's rather longer-lasting Social Credit Political League.  Douglas also lectured on Social Credit in Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Norway. 

In 1923 he appeared as a witness before the Canadian Banking Inquiry, and in 1930 before the Macmillan Committee.  In 1929 he made a lecture tour of Japan, where his ideas were enthusiastically received by industry and government. His 1933 edition of Social Credit made a reference to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which, while noting its dubious authenticity, wrote that what ""is interesting about it, is the fidelity with which the methods by which such enslavement might be brought about can be seen reflected in the facts of everyday experience."" 

Douglas died in his home in Fearnan, Scotland.  Douglas and his theories are referred to several times (unsympathetically) in Lewis Grassic Gibbon's trilogy A Scots Quair. He is also mentioned, together with Karl Marx and Silvio Gesell, by John Maynard Keynes in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936, p. 32). Douglas's theories permeate the poetry and economic writings of Ezra Pound. Robert Heinlein's first novel For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs describes a near future United States operating according to the principles of Social Credit.

Passage:
Pannage
Pannage is the practice of releasing domestic pigs in a forest, so that they can feed on fallen acorns, beechmast, chestnuts or other nuts. Historically, it was a right or privilege granted to local people on common land or in royal forests. 

Especially in the eastern shires of England, pannage was so prominent a value in the economic importance of woodland that it was often employed, as in Domesday Book (1086), as a measurement. Customarily a pig was given to the lord of the manor for every certain number of pigs loosed de herbagio, as the right of pannage was entered. Edward Hasted quotes the Domesday Survey details for Norton in Kent. ""Wood for the pannage of forty hogs"".  

Pannage is no longer carried out in most areas, but is still observed in the New Forest of Southern England, where it is also known as common of mast. It is still an important part of the forest ecology, and helps the husbandry of the other New Forest livestock – pigs can safely eat acorns as a large part of their diet, whereas excessive amounts may be poisonous to ponies and cattle.

The minimum duration of the New Forest pannage season is 60 days,  but the start date varies according to the weather – and when the acorns fall. The Court of Verderers decides when pannage will start each year. At other times pigs are not allowed to roam on the forest, with the exception that breeding sows (known as ""privileged sows"") are by custom allowed out, providing that they return to the owner's holding at night and are not a nuisance. The pigs each have several nose rings clipped into their noses to prevent them rooting too much and causing damage to grassland.
Question:
Pannage pork is considered a delicacy, on what are the pigs fed?

Fruit of the oak tree
Passage:
Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter
""Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter"" is a popular song written by British actor, screenwriter and songwriter Trevor Peacock.  It was originally sung by actor Tom Courtenay in The Lads, a British TV play of 1963, and released as a single on UK Decca. 

The best-known version of the song is by Herman's Hermits, who took it to number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 in May 1965, and number one in Canada the month before. Herman's Hermits had two US number-ones, the other being ""I'm Henry VIII, I Am"". The band never released either track as singles in Britain. ""Mrs Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter"" was recorded as an afterthought in two takes and featured unique muted rhythm guitar by Keith Hopwood and heavily accented vocals by Peter Noone, with backing from Karl Green and Keith Hopwood. The band never dreamed it would be a single let alone hit number one in the US. According to Noone the song was well known to British bands; it would often be performed at birthday parties, substituting the surname of the girl whose party was being celebrated, i.e., ""Mrs. Smith"" or ""Mrs. Jones"" instead of ""Mrs. Brown"".

Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1965 album Chipmunks à Go-Go.

The song was released in Japan on Odeon Records, a subsidiary of Toshiba, as OR-1272. It was backed by the song ""Wonderful World"".

It was covered by Nellie McKay on her 2015 album My Weekly Reader.

The former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries have historically celebrated the end of the war on 9 May. However, the Baltic countries now commemorate VE day on8 May. In Ukraine from 2015, 8 May was designated as a day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, but it is not a public holiday. It is also known as Victory Day in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Norway and the Netherlands. In 1995 the May Day bank holiday was moved from the first Monday in May, 1 May, to Monday 8 May, for that year only, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War. It was also known in Germany as Tag der Befreiung (Day of Liberation) and in the Netherlands as ""Bevrijdingsdag"" (Liberation Day) In the United States, the victory happened on President Harry Truman's 61st birthday.

Roosevelt had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France and on 8May in Berlin, Germany. Since the Soviet Union was to the east of Germany, it was 9 May Moscow time when the German military surrender became effective, which is why Russia and most of the former Soviet republics commemorate Victory Day on9 May instead of 8 May. The surrender ceremony was repeated in Berlin on April 30, 1945, by supreme German military commander Wilhelm Keitel, by Georgy Zhukov and Allied representatives. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations. Wizzard Brew is the debut album by glam rock group Wizzard, released in 1973. It reached a peak of No. 29 in the UK Albums Chart. In the United States, it was released by United Artists Records as Wizzard's Brew (with a different cover photo) but failed to chart there. The original release included a lyric and photo sheet. It was reissued on CD in 1999 but soon deleted. An expanded remastered edition, including the four A-side  and B-sides of the group's singles tracks, was released in November 2006. The album may represent an early foray into recording technique that would eventually be called lo-fi. In 2003, Mojo magazine ranked it number 18 on its list of the ""Top 50 Eccentric Albums"". The album was much more experimental than the group’s hit singles, with elements of hard rock and improvisation, especially on the lengthy ""Meet Me At The Jailhouse"" All songs written by Roy Wood, except where noted. The track listing includes a hidden bonus track: ""A Bit More"" (hidden as a hidden track: 0:47 as a ""Tunes"" hidden track) Included as a bonus track on the CD: ""You Got the Jump on Me"" ('B') - 4:39#""You Can Dance Your Rock 'n' Roll"" ('A') - 3:42#""The Carlsberg Special (Pianianos Demolianos Phone 021472)"" (B') – 4:16#""See My Baby Jive"" (B) - 5:01#""endendend"" (Hugh McDowell) -4:42 #""Angel Fingers"" (A) - 2:13#""Wear a Fast Gun""  – 9:20#""Gotta Crush (About You)""  – 3:44#""Jolly Cup of Tea"" – 7:37#""Buffalo Station/Get On Down to Memphis"" – 2:17#""I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday"" (4:39) - 4.42# ""The Ball Park Incident"" (3:42) - 3.42 # ""A bit more"" (Mike Burney) - 6:28#""A Bitmore"" (Rob's Nightmare) (A.) - 5.28# ""A Little Bit More (A)"" (A-side) (B-side, B-side and A) - 7.20# ""Frigjøringsdagen"" (Liberation Day) (8 May) ""День пам'яті та примирення"" (Memorial Day) — from 2015)                     Ukraine (9 May) “Дан перемоги нацизмом у Другі In the eighth and ninth century, religious treaties associating a particular stone with an apostle were written. Practice became to keep twelve stones and wear one a month. Wearing a single birthstone is only a few centuries old, although modern authorities differ on dates. In 1912, in an effort to standardize birthstones, the (American) National Association of Jewelers (now called Jewelers of America) met in Kansas and officially adopted a list. The table below contains many stones which are popular choices, often reflecting Polish tradition. The Gregorian calendar has poems matching each month with its birthstone. These are traditional stones of English-speaking societies. The London Eye is a giant Ferris wheel situated on the banks of the River Thames in London, England. The entire structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft). It is the tallest FerrisWheel in Europe, and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom, visited by over 3.5 million people annually. When erected in 1999, it was the tallest wheel in the world, until surpassed first by the 160 m (520 ft) Nanchang Star Star in 2006 and then the 165 m (541 ft) Singapore Flyer in 2008. It is still described by its operators as ""the world's tallest ferris wheel"" (HD) YouTube Video - London Landmarks - High Definition (HD, HD, HD) London Eye - High definition (HD), YouTube Video, High definition, High Definition, HD.    Britain's National Association. of Goldsmiths created their own standardized list of birthstones in 1937. The American Gem Trade Association added tanzanite as a December birthstone in 2002.  In 2016, the American Gem trade Association and Jewelers. of America added spinel as an additional birthstone for August.  The Jewelry Industry Council of America updated the list in 1952  by adding alexandrite to June and citrine to November; specifying pink tourmaline for October; replacing December's lapis with zircon; and switching the primary/alternative gems in March.  There is a separate list of assignment according to the day of the week of the recipient's birth:  Sunday: topaz, diamond* Monday: pearl, crystal* Tuesday: ruby, emerald* Wednesday: amethyst, lodestone* Thursday: sapphire, carnelian* Friday: emerald, cat's eye* Saturday: turquoise, diamond antilevered observation wheel"" (as the wheel is supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the Nanchang and Singapore wheels). It is the 20th tallest structure in London. The London Eye is located in the London Borough of Lambeth at the western end of Jubilee Gardens, on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge. It was officially called the British Airways London Eye and then the Merlin Entertainments London Eye. Since 20 January 2011, its official name is the EDF Energy London Eye following a three-year sponsorship deal. It is located on the south bank of the Thames, between the Houses of Parliament and the Tower of London.

There are two supposed portraits of him: one owned by the Royal Commonwealth Society in London, the other in the National Library in Canberra. He was formally reinstated in January 1651, but not long afterwards retired from the service and became a merchant in Batavia. His daughter by his first marriage had married first Philip Heylman, and later Jacob Bremer. In 1661 permission was given for his widow to marry Jan Meyndert Springer. The airline was headquartered in Building 178 and later in Hangar 17 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, Queens, New York City. Scheduled flights were initially offered over a New York - Brussels - Tel Aviv route in addition to charter flights to Athens, Frankfurt, Rome, and Zurich. Short-lived New York- Los Angeles flights were introduced with the addition of an ex-Avianca Boeing 747-100 in 1984. Tower Travel Corporation was founded by Zev Melamid and his wife Estelle in the 1970s to promote discount travel to Israel. Tower Air was co-founded, majority owned, and managed by Morris K. Nachtomi, an Israeli citizen who had emigrated to the United States. The company declared bankruptcy and was liquidated in 2000, when the company decided to end scheduled and charter commercial passenger service. It is credited with developing the wholesale charter market between New York and Tel Aviv. Arthur Fondlier, Chief Financial Officer of Pan Am and the former Tower Air, was passenger in first class section of the 103rd Pan Am flight 103. His untimely death gave Morris Nachtmi more freedom in more cost-cutting management and management methods. He is the son of a former Pan Am chief financial officer and a former CEO of El Al, Sam Fondier, who is now a senior vice-president of the Australian National University.

Tower Air's main base of scheduled operations was John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, New York. During their peak they had their own terminal (a former Pan Am Admin facility) The airline's fleet consisted of Boeing 747s in both the -100 and -200 series, including both passenger and cargo aircraft. Tower often flew charters for groups of Muslim pilgrims to Mecca. Tower Air filed for protection under Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 29, 2000, ceased all scheduled service on May 1, 2000 and surrendered their FAA air operator's certificate on November 28, 2000. The airline also sometimes provided substitute aircraft for other carriers, for example on the JFK to LHR route when weather delayed an inbound Virgin Atlantic Airways flight in December 1994. On December 20, 1995, Tower Air flight 41 from New York Kennedy to Miami veered off the runway during takeoff in a snowstorm resulting in one flight attendant receiving serious injuries and 24 passengers receiving minor injuries. The FAA successfully sought to have the airline remove Guy Nachtomi, son of the Chairman and CEO, 24 years old at that time, from the position of Vice President-Operations. This was done in part because of the airline's maintenance problems, as well as his lack of airline experience (he worked at Twentieth Century Fox until 1994).[http://sec.edgar-online.com/1998/05/01/14/0000940180-98-000483/Section9.asp TOWER AIR INC - TOWRQ Proxy Statement (definitive) (DEF 14A) COMPENSATION OF DIRECTors] The junior Mr. Nachtmi continued service with the company in a capacity unrelated to maintenance as Vice President of the Office of the chairman. The Department of Defense Commercial Airlift Review Board suspended Tower Air military charters from January 27 to February 12, 1999, pending an on-site review of its operations. The company's fleet of Boeing747s in the -200 and -100 series included both passenger. and cargo. missions all over the world. At the time of closure Tower Air had a fleet of 737-200s and Boeing 747-300s in its fleet, with a total capacity of 2,000. The fleet was made up of 747-400s, 747-500s, and 747-600s. It had a total fleet of 3,000 aircraft. Muffin was first seen by TV audiences in October 1946 in the show For The Children which was presented by Annette Mills, sister of actor John Mills. BBC chiefs have bought a new series based on the character, which is expected to be shown in the next three years. This time round, he will be animated rather than operated with strings and will live on an urban farm.Originally, the wooden puppet - which was made during the 1930s at a cost of 25 shillings ((pounds) 1.25p) - would dance as Mills played the piano. In the new show, Muffin will be seen talking to the other animals and will be something of a problem-solver. The show is being brought up to date and will now be living on a town farm rather than dancing on a piano. Just for Laughs is a comedy festival held each July in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Founded in 1983, it is the largest international comedy festival in the world. It was founded in 1983 by Gilbert Rozon as a two-day French language event. In 1985, Andy Nulman joined the festival's staff and introduced English language events as well. He directed its major shows at the Saint-Denis Theatre every July, and remained on the board of directors of the festival until 2010. After an 11-year absence to the company's parent-year, he returned in July 2010 as president of New Festivals and Television. The festival is held in the ""Latin Quarter""—an area known for its theatres, cafés and nightclubs, particularly in the evenings, the nightclubs and live music. It is also known as the ""New Quarter"" because of its boutique shopping and cafés. It has a reputation for being a great place to meet people from all over the world, particularly from the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

To see more information about the festival on the Saint Gala Gala website, visit the St Gala Facebook page or the Gala Twitter page. Just for Laughs films many performances at the annual festival in Montreal and the TV productions from these tapings air regularly on CBC Television, The Comedy Network, TVA and YTV. The shows feature stand-up performances from the festival and sometimes include ""canned bits"" shot on location around Montreal, Canada. In July 2007, Just For Laughs celebrated its 25th edition, launching a festival in Toronto, Ontario. In 2009, the Chicago festival was launched and aired on TBS. In February 1994, the festival sponsored a splinter project in Hollywood, Florida. The event, Juste Pour Rire—En Vacances, was held in the Young Circle Park, an outdoor venue with an urban park setting. The festival also has the Comedia comedy film festival component, which started in 1996. The third season of the show, titled simply Just for L laughs, began airing on June 21, 2009 at 7:00 pm ET. The program returned in the 2014-15 season as a syndicated offering to the United States through PPI Releasing, which mainly specializes in syndicating Canadian programming to American stations. The term ""Pointillism"" was first coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, and is now used without its earlier mocking connotation. Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed the technique in 1886. The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as Neo-Impressionism. The Divisionists, too, used a similar technique of patterns to form images, though with larger cube-like brushstrokes. The technique relies on the ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones. It is related to Divisionism, a more technical variant of the method. Divisionism is concerned with color theory, whereas pointillism is more focused on the specific style of brushwork used to apply the paint.""Pointillistism"" is a technique with few serious practitioners today and is seen most notably in works of Seurat, Signac and Crosnay. It was first used in the 1880s and 1890s by artists such as John Malyon/Artcyclopedia, 2007. The practice of Pointillism is in sharp contrast to the traditional methods of blending pigments on a palette. It is analogous to the four-color CMYK printing process used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of Cyan (blue), Magenta (red), Yellow, and Key (black) Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may be partly because subtractive mixing of the pigments is avoided, and partly because some of the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots. Different musical notes are made in seclusion, rather than in a linear sequence, giving a sound texture similar to the painting version of pointillism. This type of music is also known as punctualism or klangfarbenmelodie. The majority of Pointilism is done in oil paints. Anything may be used in its place, but oils are preferred for their thickness and tendency not to run or bleed.

Billboard Music Awards is an honor given by Billboard, a publication and music popularity chart covering the music business. The awards show had been held annually since 1989 in December until it went dormant in 2006. Awards were given for the top album/artist/single in different genres. The most important categories are Top Artist, Top Billboard 200 Album, Top Hot 100 Song and Top New Artist. In 2012, Katy Perry was honored with Billboard's second Spotlight award for being the first artist to have five consecutive number ones on Billboard's Hot 100 album from one album. To date, there have only been three recipients of this award: Beyoncé, Beyonce, and Whitney Houston (award accepted by her daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown) The Billboard Icon Award was first made in 2011. The 2016 Billboard Music Awards aired live on May 22 at 8/7c on ABC. They are based on United States year-end chart performance according to Nielsen data for sales, number of downloads and total airplay. The ""of the year"" portion of each category title no longer exists, and many of the awards have been further renamed. Other awards, including both ""crossover"" awards (No. 1 Classical Crossover Artist and No. 1 classical Crossover Album) were discontinued. The Billboard Chart Achievement Award (Fan-voted) is given to the artist with the highest number of songs on the Billboard Hot 100 Albums chart in the past 12 months. It is also known as the ""Billboard Century Award"" The Billboard Millennium Award recognizes artists who have had at least five consecutive top-10 singles on the Hot 100 chart. It has been given to three artists: Stevie Wonder, Prince, and Beyonce. It also recognizes artists with at least one platinum or multi-million-selling album or single in the U.S. since the 1990s. It was first given out in 1992 and has been awarded three times since then, with the most recent award being given in 2013. The ceremony is held annually in May and is held in New York City, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco. It will be held for the first time in 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada, with a ceremony to be held on June 14, 2016. The show will be broadcast live on ABC at 9 p.m. ET/PT (7 p.M. ET) and will be followed by a live broadcast on June 15, 2016 in Los Angeles and San Diego, California. The event will be hosted by Alicia Keys and Alicia Keys. le artist in history to have five consecutive number ones singles on Billboard Hot 100 from one album. Taylor Swift has won the most Billboard Music Awards with 21 wins. The awards show moved from its original home on Fox to its new network, ABC, on May 22, 2011. A new award statuette was created by New York firm Society Awards. Dick Clark Productions produces the ceremony, giving it control of both of ABC's non-country music awards specials, including the November American Music Awards. Aquatint is an intaglio printmaking technique, a variant of etching. Where the engraving technique uses a needle to make lines that print in black (or whatever colour ink is used), aquatint uses powdered rosin to create a tonal effect. The tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time. The artist applies a ground that ground that will resist the acid resist of the etching powder. In all all forms of art, the artist applies the ground that is commonly referred to as ""the ground."" The artist then applies a substance to the surface of the plate to create the ink. This can be repeated a number of times, depending on the particular technique. The process is known as ""aquatint"" or ""mezzotint"" and is used by artists to create different tones of ink on a copper or zinc plate. In the U.S. the printmaker Joseph de Lemos simplified the aquatints in art schools with his publications (19–40), which simplified the traveling exhibitions of his popular exhibitions of award-winning prints. In England, Peter Perez Burdett later introduced his'secret' aqu atint technique to England in the 1770s, and it is still used in some of his prints today. The award ceremony was canceled in 2007 due to contractual expirations and other unforeseen circumstances. Plans for a new version of the awards in 2008 (in association with AEG Live) fell through, and the BMAs were not held until 2011. On February 17, 2011, Billboard announced that it would bring theBMAs back to television, moving from itsoriginal home onFox to itsnew network,ABC. The ceremony was held in New York City on November 14, 2011 and was hosted by Alicia Keys and Alicia Keys. It was broadcast on ABC at 8 p.m. ET/PT (11 p.a. ET /PT). 'Aquatint' is a process of etching which alloying with acid. Francisco Goya famously took great advantage of aquatint printmaking, in his Los Caprichos series. David Hockney, known for his many paintings of the Los Angeles lifestyle in the 60's, has created aquatints and etchings used with color in his ""The Blue Guitar"" series of prints. The field of lepidopterology is formally known as Lepidopterology and includes hobbyists who catch, study, or simply observe butterflies. The term 'lepidopterist' is also used to refer to a person who specialises in the study of butterflies, moths, skipper butterflies, and the three-butterfly family. The process is known as 'aquatinting' and is used by artists to create large areas of tone without laborious cross-hatching. For more information, visit the Art of Aquatint website or see: www.artofaquatints.org.uk. The technique is still being used by contemporary printmakers, particularly when using the technique known as sugar-lift, which uses a solution of India ink and sugar by melting sugar into heated ink. The plate is then submerged in warm water which dissolves the sugar so that the image ""lifts off"" the plate. The exposed areas of the plate are then aqu atinted to hold ink and the plate is ready to be printed from. The first etch should be for a short period (30 seconds to 1 minute, with a wide variation depending on how light the lightest tones are meant to be) A test piece may be made with etching times noted, as the strength of the etchant will vary. More than thirty minutes should produce a very dark area. Etching for many hours (up to 24) will be as dark as etching for one hour, but the deep etch would produce raised ink on the paper. The artist may also have applied (at the very start, before any biting occurs) an acid-resistant ""stop out"" (also called an asphaltum or hard ground) if s/he intends to keep any areas totally white and free of ink, such as highlights. The plates, it is noted, are generally more durable than mezzotint plates, and are more difficult to etch for long periods of time. Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan is a hot spring hotel in Hayakawa, Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. Founded in 705 AD, it is the oldest hotel and one of the oldest companies in operation.

Gavin Gordon wrote a 1935 ballet titled The Rake's Progress, based directly on Hogarth's paintings. The 1946 RKO film Bedlam, produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rakes Progress. David Hockney created his own print edition version of the painting in 1961. Elton John's song ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" was the first No. 1 single in the UK for both John and Kiki Dee, topping the chart for six weeks in mid 1976. It is not to be confused with the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song of the same title recorded in 1965 by Dionne Warwick for the album Here I Am. John and Taupin originally intended to record the song with Dusty Springfield, but ultimately withdrew the offer; Dusty's partner Sue Cameron later said this was because she was too ill at the time. It was never included on an original album (although it was recorded during the Blue Moves sessions), but was subsequently in released as the third single on the album Duets, in early 1994. In 1985, John and Dee performed the track to the crowd at Wembley Stadium during John's set at Live Aid (where Dee sang backup). In 1987, John appeared with Minnie Mouse on the NBC series Totally Minnie Minnie. In 1992, a 1992 re-make of John's ""Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me"" with George Michael credited as a duet. The B-side, ""Snow Queen"", was supposedly inspired by John's past Sonny & Cher hits ""I Got You"" and ""My Baby Shot Me Down"", as well as the Cher song ""Bang (My Baby shot Me Down)"" The track was performed with The Muppets on the Muppet Show and performed by John and Miss Piggy in 1985, and performed with RuPaul on NBC series The Piggy Show in 1987. The song was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in the U.S.  in the 1976. In the US, Billboard ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1976, and it was ranked No. 3 on the Easy Listening chart for the same year. It has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies. The University of New Hampshire's Department of Theatre and Dance created a collaborative stage show titled ""The Rake’s Progress"" in 2003, which provided an intensive study of the etchings. ed the track with Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan) at the 2001 British Comedy awards. He also performed it with the Spice Girls on his ITV tribute programme An Audience with... Elton John. In June 2013, 37 years after its original release, the single reached one million sales in the UK. A demo version of the song was recorded by John as a solo artist. This version has not been released commercially. Les Casquets is a group of rocks 13 km northwest of Alderney and are part of an underwater sandstone ridge. The island was the location of a daring raid by the forerunner of the British SAS, the SSRF on 2 September 1942; the raid was led by Major Gus March-Phillipps DSO, OBE. In the raid the entire garrison of seven prisoners was captured and returned to England as a lighthouse and lighthouse wrecked. The poem Les Cazquets by Les Swinburne is based on the family who lived on the island for 18 years. The Houguez family were originally from Alderneys, and the poem describes their life on Les Casqets. The song was written by John Sullivan, based upon the character of Wilkins Micawber from Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield. It also appeared on John's 2-disc greatest hits album, EltonJohn's Greatest Hits 1970-2002. It has been recorded by a number of artists, including David Bowie and Elvis Costello, as well as numerous other artists including The Rolling Stones, U2, The Police and U2's Brian McFadden. It was released as a single in 1977 and has appeared on several compilation albums, including Greatest Hits Volume II (1977) and Greatest Hits 1976–1986 (1976-1986). It was also included on the 1995 UK CD of Rock of the Westies, which included it as a bonus track (the US edition did not, however). In 2002, it also appeared in the US CD Rock Of The Westies 2, which also included the bonus track 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart' The single was released in the United States in the same year as the CD, but the US edition didn't include it. The single has also been released in Europe and Australia, but not in the U.S. and Canada. It is available on iTunes, Amazon, and other online retailers. It can be pre-ordered from the iTunes store for £16.99 with a free download of the single and a free CD of the album. Encephalitis (from Ancient Greek) is an acute inflammation of the brain. Symptoms include headache, fever, confusion, drowsiness, and fatigue. In 2013, encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths, down from 92,000 in 1990. The most common causes are rabies virus, HSV infection, poliovirus, and measles virus. Other possible viral causes are arbovirus, bunyavirus, arenavirus (La Crosse strain) and reovirus (Colorado tick virus) Some cases of limbcephalitis are of autoimmune origin. Individuals can exhibit upper body weakness, muscular pains, tremors and tremors, though the cause of this is not always known. The clinical presentation often includes disorientation, disinhibition, memory loss, seizures and behavioral anomalies. MRI imaging reveals T2 hyperintensity in the structures of the medial temporal lobes and in some cases, other limbic structures in other cases, as well as abnormal movements and dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. Some cases can also be caused by catatonia, cataracts, and other autoimmune conditions such as lupus, rickets, and streptococcal infections. The condition can be treated with antibiotics, but it can also lead to long-term damage to the brain and other parts of the body. It can be fatal if left untreated. It is the second most common cause of death in the UK, after heart disease and lung disease. It has no known cure, but can be controlled with medication. The only treatment for it is to have it surgically removed from the brain, and to keep it in a stable condition for at least a few weeks. The symptoms include seizures or convulsions, tremor, hallucinations, stroke, and memory problems. It may also be a complication of a current infectious disease such as syphilis (secondary encephaliti) or toxoplasmosis, malaria, or primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, or Lyme disease and/or Bartonella henselae may also causeEncephalitis is an inflammatory disease confined to the limbic system of the head and neck. It causes fever, headache, confusion and sometimes seizures. It also can cause memory loss and other symptoms such as memory problems and hallucinations. The disease can be confused with meningitis, which is also known as ""meningitis"" or ""meningitis"" It can also cause memory problems, such as confusion and memory loss in children and infants. epidemic of encephalitis lethargica occurred worldwide. Diagnosis is done via a variety of tests: brain scan, blood test, urine analysis. Treatment (which is based on supportive care) is as follows: vaccine against tick-borne  and Japanese encephaliti and at-risk individuals. Post-infectious encephalomyelitis complicating smallpox vaccination is avoidable, for all intents and purposes, as smallpox is nearly eradicated. Encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths in 2013, down from 92,000 in 1990. In 2013, there were 7.4 cases per 100,000 population per year in Western countries.

The East Coast of the United States is the coastline along which the Eastern United States meets the North Atlantic Ocean. This area is also known as the Eastern Seaboard, the Atlantic Coast, and the Atlantic Seab Coast. The shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The place name ""East Coast"" derives from the idea that the contiguous 48 states are defined by two major coastlines, one at the western edge and one on the eastern edge. Other terms for referring to this area include the ""Eastern Coast"" being American English for coast, and ""AtlanticAtlantic"" (because the ""Atlantic Ocean"" lies along the ""Seaboard"" ""Eastern coast"" is the name of the house in which Julie Christie is trapped in the 1977 film Demon Seed. ""Demon Seed"" has been described as ""a combination of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, with a dash of Buster Keaton's Electric House thrown in"", and Christopher Null of FilmCritic.com said ""There's no way you can claim Demon Seed is a classic, or even any good, really, but it's undeniably worth an hour and a half of your time."" The film is considered one of the most influential sci-fi films of the 20th century, along with ""The Matrix"" and ""The Godfather"" The film was directed by Robert Altman, who also co-wrote the screenplay for ""The Terminator"" and directed the first two ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II"" films. The film has been called ""the most influential computer movie of all time"" by ""The New York Times"" ates that have a shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia border tidal arms of the Atlantic (the Delaware River and the Potomac River, respectively) Vermont and West Virginia have no Atlantic coastline, but they are sometimes grouped with the Eastern Seaboard states because of their locations in New England and the Southern United States. The East Coast is a low-relief, passive margin coast. It has been shaped by the Pleistocene glaciation in the far northern areas from New York City northward. Although landfalls are rare, the Eastern seaboard is susceptible to hurricanes in the Atlantic hurricane season, officially running from June 1 to November 30. The far southern portion of the East Coast from southeast Florida (Palm Beach area) south through the Florida Keys has a tropical climate, which is normally frost free and is warm to hot all year. Many of the larger capes along the lower East Coast are in fact barrier islands, like the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Florida Keys are made up of limestone coral and provide the only coral reefs on the US mainland. The coastal plain broadens southwards, separated from the Piedmont region by the Atlantic Seab Coast fall line of theEast Coast rivers, often marking the head of navigation and prominent sites of cities. The region from southern Connecticut south to about the Virginia Eastern Shore has a temperate climate, with hot summers and cool winters with a mix of rain and snow. The area from southeastern Virginia south to central Florida has a humid subtropicalclimate, with long hot summers, and mild winters. The coast from Long Island south to Florida is often made up. of barrier islands that front the coastal areas. In 2010, the population of the states which have Shoreline on East Coast was estimated at 112. C.H. Douglas was a British engineer and pioneer of the Social Credit economic reform movement. He noticed that the weekly total costs of goods produced was greater than the sums paid to workers for wages, salaries and dividends. This seemed to contradict the theory of classic Ricardian economics, that all costs are distributed simultaneously as purchasing power. Freeing workers from this system by bringing purchasing power in line with production became the basis of Douglas's reform ideas that became known as Social Credit. The northernmost U.S. state on the eastern seaboard lies partly north of its neighbouring Canadian territory. The state is Maine, which has a population of 36.42,503 (36% of the country's total population). It is also home to the University of Maine at Augusta, which offers a degree in political science and a master's degree in history. It is the only state in the United States that does not have a state university. It also has the only high-speed rail passenger service in the Americas, Amtrak's Downeaster and Northeast Regional. The Acela Express has up to a 54% share of the combined train and air passenger market between New York and Boston. The East Coast is connected from Norfolk, Virginia, to Miami, Florida, by the Intracoastal Waterway, also known as the East Coast Canal, which was completed in 1912. The primary Interstate Highway along the East coast is Interstate 95,  completed in the late 1970s, which replaced the historic U.s. Route 1 (Atlantic Highway),   the original federal highway that traversed all East Coast states (except Delaware).   By water, the EastCoast is connected to the Florida Keys by the Florida Bay Bridge, which runs from Miami to Key Largo, Florida. The Florida Keys are home to one of the world's largest oil refineries, the Florida Refining and Refining Company, which is based in Clearwater, Florida and has a fleet of more than 1,000 vessels. Douglas observed that the cost of production is consumption. His ideas inspired the Canadian social credit movement. He is mentioned, together with Karl Marx and Silvio Gesell, by John Maynard Keynes in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. His theories permeate the poetry and economic writings of Ezra Pound. Robert Heinlein's first novel For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs describes a near future United States operating according to the principles of Social Credit. Douglas's theories are referred to several times (unsympathetically) in Lewis Grassic Gibbon's trilogy A Scots Quair. He died in his home in Fearnan, Scotland, in 1936. He was buried in Glasgow, in the family grave of his wife, the former Baroness Douglas, who he married in 1937. He had a son, Peter, who is now the director of the University of Glasgow's School of Economics and Business, and a daughter, Fiona, who works for the Scottish Department of Energy and Climate Change. Douglas was also the founder of the Scottish Institute of Technology and Science, which is based in Glasgow. He wrote a book, Social Credit: A Theory of Economic Theory and Practice, published in 1933, and later died in Scotland in 1936, aged 80. He also wrote a second book, The Social Credit Theory and Policy, published later the same year, which was published in Australia and New Zealand, and also in Canada and Japan. Douglas is buried in a grave in the village of Fife, in Scotland, where he lived with his wife and three children. His son Peter is now a professor of economics at Glasgow University, and his daughter-in-law is a former headmistress of Glasgow University. Douglas died in Fife in 1986, and is buried there in the Fife village of St Mary's, near the town of Hounslow, in southern Scotland, and in the county of Strathearn, in northern Scotland. He has a son and two daughters, Peter and Fiona, both of whom live in Scotland. Douglas also has a grandson, David, who lives in Glasgow and works as a consultant for the Bank of Scotland. ""Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter"" is a popular song written by British actor, screenwriter and songwriter Trevor Peacock. It was originally sung by actor Tom Courtenay in The Lads, a British TV play of 1963, and released as a single on UK Decca. The best-known version of the song is by Herman's Hermits, who took it to number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 in May 1965, and number one in Canada the month before. The song was released in Japan on Odeon Records, a subsidiary of Toshiba, as OR-1272, backed by the song ""Wonderful World"" It was covered by Nellie McKay on her 2015 album My Weekly Reader. Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1965 album Chipmunk à Go-Go. The band never released either track as singles in Britain. It would often be performed at birthday parties, substituting the surname of the girl whose party was being celebrated, i.e., ""Mrs. Smith"" or ""Mrs Jones"" instead of ""Mrs Brown"". It was recorded as an afterthought in two takes and featured unique muted rhythm guitar by Keith Hopwood and heavily accented vocals by Peter Noone, with backing from Karl Green andKeith Hopwood."
"Passage:
High Willhays
High Willhays or, according to some authors, High Willes  is the highest point on Dartmoor, Devon, at 621 metres (2,039 ft) above sea level,Dartmoor National Park Authority, [http://web.archive.org/web/20070808234510/http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/lab-geninfo.pdf General Information: Dartmoor Factsheet], 2004, p. 1 and the highest point in the United Kingdom south of the Brecon Beacons.

Toponymy

In 1912, William Crossing, writer and documenter, said that the name High Willes had been thought to have derived from the word huel or wheal meaning mine, but he did not think that very likely as old mine workings were invariably located near to streams. He suggested instead that the name derived from gwylfa, a watching place, noting its similarity with Brown Willy, the name of the highest hill on nearby Bodmin Moor, and suggested that a watch for beacon fires used to be kept here. He also posited a possible link to the word gwili meaning winding or tortuous, but said it was unlikely this was where it originated from.

The Place-Names of Devon (1931) notes that the peak was named Hight Wyll in a document of 1532, and was known in 1827 as High Willows. The authors state that the name may simply be a compound of high and well (meaning spring), though they admit that the additional syllable at the end is hard to explain. 

Topography

High Willhays is near the northwestern edge of Dartmoor, about 2.5 km south east of Meldon Reservoir and about 5 km south of the town of Okehampton. Although it is the highest point of the moor, it is relatively insignificant in comparison to most of the moor's tors, consisting of no more than a few low outcrops of rock along a north-south ridge. The largest outcrop is crowned with a cairn. The more impressive, but slightly lower, Yes Tor is about 1 km north along this ridge, which is known as ""the roof of Devon"".

High Willhays and Yes Tor are the only summits in England south of Kinder Scout in the Peak District to rise above 2000 ft, apart from Black Mountain on the Welsh border. Before Ordnance Survey measured accurately the heights of High Willhays and Yes Tor many people believed Yes Tor was the higher of the two, and it was only the local farmers and moormen that believed the contrary.  However, the first topographical survey of the area carried out by Ordnance Survey suggested that High Willhays was twelve feet higher, although the difference has now been measured at just eight feet. William Crossing stated that High Willhays was the highest point in England south of Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales, but since then surveys have shown that Kinder Scout is also higher.

The geology of High Willhays, like most of Dartmoor, consists of granite intruded about 280 million years ago. However High Willhays is in an area of the northern plateau of the moor where the exposed rock has noticeably fewer of the large feldspar megacrysts that are typical of most of Dartmoor's tors.  Each of the outcrops displays lamellar bedding.

High Willhays is within one of Dartmoor's Danger Zones, areas used periodically by the British Army for exercises. Red flags are raised around the perimeter when live-firing is due to take place.

Thuluth
Thuluth ( sols, Turkish: Sülüs, from  ' ""one-third"") is a script variety of Islamic calligraphy invented by Ibn Muqlah Shirazi. The straight angular forms of Kufic were replaced in the new script by curved and oblique lines. In Thuluth, one-third of each letter slopes, from which the name (meaning ""a third"" in Arabic) comes. An alternative theory to the meaning is that the smallest width of the letter is one third of the widest part. It is an elegant, cursive script, used in medieval times on mosque decorations. Various calligraphic styles evolved from Thuluth through slight changes of form.

History

The greatest contributions to the evolution of the Thuluth script, occurred during Ottoman Empire in three successive steps that Ottoman Art Historians call ""calligraphical revolutions"":

*The first revolution occurred in the 15th century and was initiated by the Master Calligrapher Şeyh Hamdullah.[http://www.kalemguzeli.net/huseyin-kutlu-hat-sanati-kalemi-sevk-edebilmektir.html Hüseyin Kutlu: Hat sanatı kalemi şevk edebilmektir - Kalem Güzeli][http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00xcallig/mughalearly/zzturkey/hamdullah1500s.html hamdullah1500s]
*The second revolution resulted from the work of the Ottoman calligrapher Hâfız Osman in the 17th century.[http://www.istanbul.edu.tr/Bolumler/guzelsanat/kitap.htm Kitap Sanatı] 
*Finally, in the late 19th century, Mehmed Şevkî Efendi gave the script the distinctive shape it has today.[http://sanattarihi.wordpress.com/2006/10/01/mehmed-sevki-efendi-2/ Mehmed Şevki Efendi « Sanat Tarihi] [http://www.turkislamsanatlari.com/sevkiefendi.asp Türk Ýslam Sanatlarý - Tezyini Sanatlar]

Artists

The best known artist to write the Thuluth script at its zenith is said to be Mustafa Râkım Efendi (1757–1826), a painter who set a standard in Ottoman calligraphy which many believe has not been surpassed to this day.[http://calligrapher.blogsome.com/2006/04/20/rakim-mustafa-rakim-1757-1826/ Journal of Ottoman Calligraphy :: RAKIM: “Mustafa Rakim” (1757 - 1826) :: April :: 2006]

Usage

Thuluth was used to write the headings of surahs, Qur'anic chapters. Some of the oldest copies of the Qur'an were written in Thuluth. Later copies were written in a combination of Thuluth and either Naskh or Muhaqqaq. After the 15th century Naskh came to be used exclusively.

The script is used in the Flag of Saudi Arabia where its text, Shahada al Tawhid, is written in Thuluth.

Style

An important aspect of Thuluth script is the use of harakat (""hareke"" in Turkish) to represent vowel sounds and of certain other stylistic marks to beautify the script. The rules governing the former are similar to the rules for any Arabic script. The stylistic marks have their own rules regarding placement and grouping which allow for great creativity as to shape and orientation. For example, one grouping technique is to separate the marks written below letters from those written above.

Scripts developed from Thuluth

Since its creation, Thuluth has given rise to a variety of scripts used in calligraphy and over time has allowed numerous modifications. Jeli Thuluth was developed for use in large panels, such as those on tombstones. Muhaqqaq script was developed by widening the horizontal sections of the letters in Thuluth. Naskh script introduced a number of modifications resulting in smaller size and greater delicacy. Tevki is a smaller version of Thuluth .

Ruq'ah was probably derived from the Thuluth and Naskh styles, the latter itself having originated from Thuluth.

[Middle English, from Latin Amāzōn, from Greek Amazōn, probably of Iranian origin.]
Word History: In classical legend, the Amazons were a tribe of warrior women. Their name is supposedly derived from Greek a-mazos, ""without a breast,"" because according to the legend they cut off their right breasts so as to be better able to shoot with a bow and arrow. This folk etymology, like most folk etymologies, is incorrect, but the Amazons of legend are not so completely different from the historical Amazons, who were also warriors. The historical Amazons were Scythians, an Iranian people renowned for their cavalry. The first Greeks to come into contact with the Iranians were the Ionians, who lived on the coast of Asia Minor and were constantly threatened by the Persians, the most important of the Iranian peoples. Amazōn is the Ionian Greek form of the Iranian word ha-mazan, ""fighting together."" The regular Greek form would be hamazōn, but because the Ionians dropped their aitches like Cockneys, hamazōn became amazōn, the form taken into the other Greek dialects.

What is narcolepsy, symptoms & causes - WebMD
What is narcolepsy, symptoms & causes - WebMD
How Is Narcolepsy Treated?
Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness. People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. These sudden sleep attacks may occur during any type of activity at any time of the day.
In a typical sleep cycle , we initially enter the early stages of sleep followed by deeper sleep stages and ultimately (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep . For people suffering from narcolepsy, REM sleep occurs almost immediately in the sleep cycle, as well as periodically during the waking hours. It is in REM sleep that we can experience dreams and muscle paralysis -- which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy.
Narcolepsy usually begins between the ages of 15 and 25, but it can become apparent at any age. In many cases, narcolepsy is undiagnosed and, therefore, untreated.
What Causes Narcolepsy?
The cause of narcolepsy is not known; however, scientists have made progress toward identifying genes strongly associated with the disorder. These genes control the production of chemicals in the brain that may signal sleep and awake cycles. Some experts think narcolepsy may be due to a deficiency in the production of a chemical called hypocretin by the brain . In addition, researchers have discovered abnormalities in various parts of the brain involved in regulating REM sleep . These abnormalities apparently contribute to symptom development. According to experts, it is likely narcolepsy involves multiple factors that interact to cause neurological dysfunction and REM sleep disturbances.
What Are the Symptoms of Narcolepsy?
Symptoms of narcolepsy include:
Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS): In general, EDS interferes with normal activities on a daily basis, whether or not a person with narcolepsy has sufficient sleep at night. People with EDS report mental cloudiness, a lack of energy and concentration, memory lapses, a depressed mood, and/or extreme exhaustion.
Cataplexy: This symptom consists of a sudden loss of muscle tone that leads to feelings of weakness and a loss of voluntary muscle control. It can cause symptoms ranging from slurred speech to total body collapse, depending on the muscles involved, and is often triggered by intense emotions such as surprise, laughter, or anger.
Hallucinations : Usually, these delusional experiences are vivid and frequently frightening. The content is primarily visual, but any of the other senses can be involved. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations when accompanying sleep onset and hypnopompic hallucinations when they occur during awakening.
Sleep paralysis : This symptom involves the temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. These episodes are generally brief, lasting a few seconds to several minutes. After episodes end, people rapidly recover their full capacity to move and speak.
Continued
How Is Narcolepsy Diagnosed?
A physical exam and exhaustive medical history are essential for proper diagnosis of narcolepsy. However, none of the major symptoms is exclusive to narcolepsy. Several specialized tests, which can be performed in a sleep disorders clinic or sleep lab, usually are required before a diagnosis can be established. Two tests that are considered essential in confirming a diagnosis of narcolepsy are the polysomnogram (PSG) and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).
The PSG is an overnight test that takes continuous multiple measurements while a patient is asleep to document abnormalities in the sleep cycle. A PSG can help reveal whether REM sleep occurs at abnormal times in the sleep cycle and can eliminate the possibility that an individual's symptoms result from another condition.
The MSLT is performed during the day to measure a person's tendency to fall asleep and to determine whether isolated elements of REM sleep intrude at inappropriate times during the waking hours. As part of the test, an individual is asked to take four or five short naps usually scheduled two hours apart.
How Is Narcolepsy Treated?
Although there is no cure for narcolepsy, the most disabling symptoms of the disorder (EDS and symptoms of abnormal REM sleep, such as cataplexy) can be controlled in most people with drug treatment. Sleepiness is treated with amphetamine -like stimulants, while the symptoms of abnormal REM sleep are treated with antidepressant drugs.
There has recently been a new medication approved for those who suffer from narcolepsy with cataplexy. This drug, called Xyrem , helps people with narcolepsy get a better night's sleep, allowing them to be less sleepy during the day. Patients with narcolepsy can be substantially helped -- but not cured -- by medical treatment.
Lifestyle adjustments such as avoiding caffeine , alcohol, nicotine, and heavy meals, regulating sleep schedules, scheduling daytime naps (10-15 minutes in length), and establishing a normal exercise and meal schedule may also help to reduce symptoms.

Louis XIV
1638 - 1715
French King
Louis XIV was called the Grand Monarch or Sun King.  His 72-year reign was the longest in modern European history.
Louis was the son of Louis XIII, whom he succeeded at the age of five. During his childhood France was ruled by his mother, and her chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin. In 1660 Louis married Maria Theresa, the daughter of Philip IV of Spain.
In 1661 he assumed sole responsibility for government. He initiated an aggressive foreign, particularly against the Dutch; but his major political rivals were the Austrian Habsburgs. From 1665 Louis tried to take  possession of the Spanish Netherlands, but later tried to acquire the whole Spanish inheritance, which led to the War of the Spanish Sucession .
Louis XIV brought France to its peak of absolute power and his words  'L'etat c'est moi' ('I am the state') express the spirit of a rule in  which the king held all political authority. His absolutism brought him into conflict with the Huguenots and the papacy, with damaging repercussions.
His many foreign wars became a financial burden, yet his long reign is associated  with the greatest age of French culture, symbolized by the Palace of Versailles.

Passage:
Clarified butter
Clarified butter is milk fat rendered from butter to separate the milk solids and water from the butterfat.  Typically, it is produced by melting butter and allowing the components to separate by density. The water evaporates, some solids float to the surface and are skimmed off, and the remainder of the milk solids sink to the bottom and are left behind when the butter fat (which would then be on top) is poured off.

Commercial methods of production also include direct evaporation, but may also be accomplished by decantation and centrifugation followed by vacuum drying; or direct from cream by breaking the emulsion followed by centrifugation.  

Properties

Clarified butter has a higher smoke point (485 °F or 252 °C) than regular butter (325-375 °F or 163-190 °C),  and is therefore preferred in some cooking applications, such as sautéing. Clarified butter also has a much longer shelf life than fresh butter. It has negligible amounts of lactose and casein and is, therefore, acceptable to most who have a lactose intolerance or milk allergy. 

Regional variations

In South Asian cuisine and Arab cuisine, clarified butter (ghee) may be cooked long enough to evaporate the water portion and caramelize the milk solids (which are then filtered out), resulting in a nutty flavor.

Hablot Knight Browne (10 July 1815 – 8 July 1882) was an English artist.  Well-known by his pen name, Phiz, he illustrated books by Charles Dickens, Charles Lever, and Harrison Ainsworth.

Biography

Of Huguenot ancestry, Hablot Knight Browne was born in England, in Lambeth (near London) on Kennington Lane.  He was the fourteenth of Catherine and William Loder Browne's fifteen children. According to Valerie Browne Lester, Phiz was in fact the illegitimate son of his putative eldest sister Kate and Captain Nicholas Hablot of Napoleon's Imperial Guard. There is some uncertainty regarding the exact date of birth. 10 July 1815 is the date given by Valerie Browne Lester, his great-great-granddaughter. John Buchanan-Brown in his book Phiz!: illustrator of Dickens' world says 12 July 1815. The date on his Christening record of 21 December 1815 at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, Surrey, England gives 11 June 1815, as does the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition and 15 June 1815 (Dictionary of National Biography). A copy of the program from his burial service, which is still owned by the Browne family, says he was born 10 July 1815. 

When he was 7 years old, his father William Browne abandoned his family, changed his name to Breton and sailed with embezzled funds to Philadelphia where he became known for his watercolour paintings. William Browne was then declared dead by his wife Catherine. 
Thomas Moxon, husband of William's sister Ann Loder Browne, helped to support the family, who were left badly off.

Browne was apprenticed to William Finden, an engraver, in whose studio he obtained his only artistic education. However, he was unsuited for engraving, and having during 1833 secured an important prize from the Society of Arts for a drawing of John Gilpin, he abandoned engraving in the following year and began other artistic work, with the ultimate object of becoming a painter.

Artistic career

In the spring of 1836, he met Charles Dickens. It was at the time when Dickens was looking for someone to illustrate  Pickwick. Browne had been the illustrator of his little pamphlet Sunday under Three Heads. In the original edition of Pickwick, issued in shilling monthly parts from early in 1836 until the end of 1837, the first seven plates were drawn by Robert Seymour,  who committed suicide in April 1836. The next two plates were by Robert William Buss.

Browne and William Makepeace Thackeray visited the publishers' office with specimens of their work for Dickens's inspection. The novelist preferred Browne. Browne's first two etched plates for Pickwick were signed ""Nemo,"" but the third was signed ""Phiz,"" a pseudonym which was retained in future. When asked to explain why he chose this name he answered that the change from ""Nemo"" to ""Phiz"" was made to harmonize better with Dickens's ""Boz.""

Phiz developed the character Sam Weller graphically just as Seymour had developed Pickwick. Dickens and Phiz became good friends and in 1838 travelled together to Yorkshire to see the schools of which Nicholas Nickleby became the hero: afterwards they made several journeys of this nature in company to facilitate the illustrator's work. Other Dickens characters illustrated by Phiz were Squeers, Micawber, Guppy, Major Bagstock, Mrs Gamp, Tom Pinch and David Copperfield.

Of the ten books by Dickens which Phiz illustrated, he is most known for David Copperfield, Pickwick, Dombey and Son, Martin Chuzzlewit and Bleak House. Browne made several drawings for Punch in his early days and also towards the end of his life. He designed the wrapper which was used for eighteen months from January 1842. He also contributed to Punch's Pocket Books.

In addition to his work for Dickens, Phiz illustrated more than twenty of Lever's novels (among them Harry Lorrequer, Charles O'Malley, Jack Hinton and the Knight of Gwynne). He also illustrated Harrison Ainsworth's and Frank Smedley's novels. Mervyn Clitheroe by Ainsworth is one of the most accomplished of the artist's works. Browne was in continual employment by publishers until 1867, when he suffered an illness that caused a degree of paralysis. After recovering, he produced many woodcuts. In 1878 he was awarded an annuity by the Royal Academy. His health gradually worsened until he died on 8 July 1882.

Most of Browne's work was etched on steel plates because these yielded a far larger edition than copper. Browne was annoyed at some of his etchings being transferred to stone by the publishers and printed as lithographic reproductions. Partly with the view to prevent this treatment of his work, he employed a machine to rule a series of lines over the plate in order to obtain what appeared to be a tint; when manipulated with acid this tint gave an effect somewhat resembling mezzotint, which at that time it was found practically impossible to transfer to stone.

Four of his illustrations were issued as stamps by the Royal Mail in 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens.

Passage:
Mermaid Theatre
The Mermaid Theatre was a theatre encompassing the site of Puddle Dock and Curriers' Alley  at Blackfriars in the City of London, and the most recently built in the City since the time of Shakespeare. It was, importantly, also one of the first new theatres to abandon the traditional stage layout; instead a single tier of seats surrounded the stage on three sides.

History

The 20th-century theatre was the life's work of actor Bernard Miles with his wife, Josephine Wilson. His original Mermaid Theatre was a large barn at his house in the St. John's Wood area of London. This seated 200 people, and during 1951 and 1952 was used for concerts, plays and a celebrated opera production of Dido and Aeneas with Kirsten Flagstad, Maggie Teyte and Thomas Hemsley, conducted by Geraint Jones, which was recorded by HMV. For the third season in 1953 the Mermaid Theatre was moved to the Royal Exchange. 

Miles was encouraged to build a permanent theatre and, raising money from public subscriptions, he oversaw the creation of the new building on land formerly occupied by a warehouse. This site was close to the location of an abortive attempt, in the Jacobean era, to build a theatre (named Porter's Hall) for the amalgamation of the Children of the Queen's Revels and Lady Elizabeth's Men. This project, undertaken by Philip Rosseter with distant backing from Henslowe and Alleyn, was ended because of complaints from the neighbourhood's residents.

The new Mermaid Theatre opened in 1959 with a successful production of Lock Up Your Daughters and it was the venue for many other very successful productions, such as Cowardy Custard (often cited as responsible for the revival of interest in Noël Coward's works) and including an annual staging of Treasure Island, with Miles reprising his role of Long John Silver, which he also played in a television version. The Mermaid Theatre also ran the Molecule Club, educating children about science.

In July 1961 the poet and author Sylvia Plath read her poem ""Tulips"" at the Poetry at the Mermaid Festival, sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain. The programme notes that there were twelve commissioned poets at the festival, one of whom was Plath's husband, Ted Hughes.

Other notable productions include the 1978 première of Whose Life Is It Anyway?, with Tom Conti and Rona Anderson. 

Gomba Holdings, a property company owned by Ugandan Asian businessman Abdul Shamji and his family, which claimed to have interests in the Garrick and Duchess theatres as well as Wembley Stadium,  bought the theatre in the mid-1980s in the hope of redeveloping the Puddle Dock site. Bernard Miles' tenure as honorary artistic advisor was abruptly terminated and the theatre's importance declined. In 1989 Abdul Shamji was sentenced to 15-months in prison over his involvement in the Johnson Matthey bank collapse.    Josephine Wilson died in 1990 and Bernard (by then Lord) Miles died in 1991, financially destitute.

Marc Sinden was appointed artistic director in 1993, opening the Bernard Miles Studio as a second performance area,  but left the next year.  Actor Roy Marsden and Vanessa Ford took over the running of the theatre for a few months prior to its eventual closure and the termination of the Shamji family's ownership.

After a further change of ownership the theatre was slated for demolition in 2002 as part of redevelopment plans. Already it had fallen into disuse, the buildings being used more often as a conference centre than a theatre. A preservation campaign by actors and other supporters attempted to reverse the decision. In April 2003 Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, ordered the council to block the demolition. As of March 2005 new plans had been submitted for the redevelopment of the site. Nothing materialised and the building continued to operate primarily as a conference centre. The BBC Concert Orchestra used it for occasional concerts, and the BBC recorded a popular weekly radio show, Friday Night is Music Night that showcased musicians such as the violinist Nigel Kennedy and singer Josh Groban. In 2006, music duo Pet Shop Boys played a mid-length set accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra and special guests including Robbie Williams, Francis Barber and Rufus Wainwright which was musically directed by Trevor Horn. The show was documented on the audio release entitled Concrete.

Loss of theatre status, and redevelopment plans

In September 2008 the Corporation of London City Planning Committee, against the advice of the Theatres Trust and noted actors, producers and artistic directors,  granted a certificate that stripped the former playhouse of its theatre status. The move may save the developer £6 million worth of Section 106 funding which it had previously agreed to pay in lieu if it closed the 600-seat Mermaid; the company could be released from the obligation because no theatrical productions have taken place for more than ten years.  The existing plans would see the Puddle Dock building converted into a conference centre and fitness suite, plus offices, a nightclub and retail and restaurant space. Campaigners are concerned that the entire building may be demolished.  John Levitt, former chairman of Save London’s Theatres Campaign, which led the high profile battle to save the venue, branded the decision “a tragedy” and “sheer meanness”.

Etymology for “Mc‑” and “O’‑” prefix in surnames

There is clearly a prefix in names like McDonald, McChrystal, O’Brian, O’Neal.
What does this Mc- and O- prefix signify? It looks like Donald, Chrystal, Brian, Neal are perfectly fine names on their own, so why is there a prefix before it?
  
 
You forgot to mention another prefix for names, that is ""Fitz"" as in Fitzgerald. It also means ""son of"" and it clearly shows noble French Norman ancestry. –  Paola Sep 14 '12 at 19:54

@Paola: ""fitz"" can be derived from Norman French, true, but that does not mean someone with a surname in Fitz- necessarily has Norman, French, or noble ancestry. –  Marthaª Nov 1 '12 at 13:21
  
 
@Marthaª Fitz was used for bastard-names, so FitzRoy was a natural son of the king .  There are also various sorts of FitzWhatevers, like FitzWilliam or FitzCharles or FitzClarence — all originally “illegitimate” children, but sometimes not forever staying that way. –  tchrist♦ Dec 7 '14 at 23:56
The standard way to form a name using a simple patronymic byname for men is:
    <single given name> mac <father's given name (in genitive case & sometimes lenited)>
which means
    <given name> son <of father's given name>
For example, Donnchadh who is the son of Fearchar mac Domhnaill would be:
    Donnchadh mac Fearchair
The standard way to form a name using an Irish clan affiliation byname for men is:
    <single given name> Ó <eponymous clan ancestor's name (in genitive case)>
which means
  <given name> male descendant <of eponymous clan ancestor>
For example, Donnchadh who is the son of Fearchar Ó Conchobhair would be:
    Donnchadh Ó Conchobhair
which means
    Donnchadh male descendant of Conchobhar
Two common misconceptions are (1) that Mac means ""son of"" — it actually means just ""son"", and the ""of"" comes from putting the father's name into the possessive case; and (2) that Mc is Irish while Mac is Scottish (or vice versa) — actually, Mc and Mac are two ways to write the same thing, and both occur in names from both countries. (What is true is that O' is almost exclusively Irish; despite the romantic notions we have of Scottish clans, they didn't use their clan affiliation in their names.)
Edit: as for why the prefix is used even though the prefix-less names look perfectly fine on their own, this is basically Gaelic grammar and thus out of scope for this site. Suffice it to say, some languages are fine with unmarked patronymics — names that identify the bearer's father using the unmodified given name — but Gaelic is not one of them.

I found the following quote which could be helpful. It is from David Booth's (1766-1846) book: An Analytical Dictionary of the English Language.
""Words in ITE very generally denote one of a tribe or nation, and as such may be taken substantively, and have the plural. The Old Testament is full of such denominations, such as the Hittites, the Midianites, &c. Like the ides of Homer, they bore the name of their ancestor. The Israelites were the children of Israel, as the Danaides were of Danaus ; in the same manner as the MAC (son) of the Irish, refers to the father of the tribe, to whose name the syllable is prefixed. Such PATRONYMICS (father-names), as they are called, exist among all nations.""

Passage:
Daewoo Nubira
The Daewoo Nubira is a compact car which was produced by South Korean automaker Daewoo from 1997 to 2002 as a sedan, hatchback, and wagon.

Overview

Daewoo Nubira (J100 platform) was released in 1997 reflecting Daewoo's new found design and manufacturing prowess. Built in Kunsan, South Korea in a factory equipped with sophisticated laser-guided robots, it was developed as a replacement for the Daewoo Nexia and styled in Italy by Italian I.DE.A Institute. Engineering was carried out and overseen by former Porsche engineer Ulrich Bez (later of Aston Martin) using experience Daewoo gained from manufacturing previous GM platforms. The name Nubira (누비라) is the command form of the Korean verb Nubida (누비다), meaning to crisscross.  Thus the name was chosen to convey the aspiration that this car would be seen crisscrossing every corner of the globe.

The Nubira II (J150) was released for model year 2000. Over 90 improvements were made by Daewoo's Worthing Technical Centre in the United Kingdom, including an increase in passenger space and a decrease in noise, harshness and vibration (by adding a fourth engine mount and retuning the intake resonators for example). Offset crash performance was further improved in the second generation, as demonstrated by Australian ANCAP tests, though it fell well short of exemplary performance. The exterior was reworked, creating a more dynamic upright and swept look of the era, a design later seen reflected by the Lexus ES350 and 2004 Mitsubishi Diamante.

In the United States, the Nubira was marketed with Daewoo's smaller subcompact Lanos and midsize Leganza. Daewoo had a difficult time entering the US auto market due to financial trouble at home; with 2002 being the last model year available due to bankruptcy and a lack of new product. In North America, the cars are relatively obscure, if not rare, and sourcing parts for them became relatively difficult; though many powertrain parts were shared worldwide with other GM platforms (Opel, Holden, Isuzu). 

Buyers could opt for either the base SE models, (mid range SX only available for 1999) or the premium CDX with standard features such as ABS, heated mirrors, cruise control, in-dash CD player and optional leather seating and power sunroof.

United States Nubira models came equipped only with an Australian built Holden produced DOHC 16-valve 2.0-liter inline-4 General Motors ""D-Tec"" gasoline engine paired with either a Daewoo-designed D-20 five-speed manual transaxle or optional GM sourced 4T40E auto. Producing 136 lbft torque at 4,400 rpm, the GM Family-II engine had a square 3.4"" stroke and a 3.4"" bore and at 5,400 rpm making 129 bhp. International market Nubiras had a choice of a Daewoo ""E-Tech"" 1.6, or Holden 1.8 or 2.0-litre inline-four gasoline engines: no diesel version was ever offered, although the Worthing Technical Centre installed Renault's F8 1.9-litre engine in a small number of test vehicles, under a development programme known as J151.

The Nubira was also briefly produced from CKD kits on Taganrog, Russia TagAZ factory; it was marketed as the Doninvest Orion by the Russian automaker Doninvest. Until 2008, Daewoo Nubira was produced in Romania in a former Daewoo factory which had the licence from GM Daewoo. The Daewoo Nubira was still produced in Egypt in 2008, in a former Daewoo factory which has the licence from GM Daewoo.

The Nubira was replaced in 2004 with the J200 Daewoo Lacetti Suzuki Forenza, under GMDAT management with a new Pininfarina-designed body offered as a sedan, station wagon, and Italdesign hatchback and sold in some European markets as the Chevrolet Nubira.

Passage:
Firedamp
Firedamp is flammable gas found in coal mines. It is the name given to a number of flammable gases, especially methane. It is particularly found in areas where the coal is bituminous. The gas accumulates in pockets in the coal and adjacent strata, and when they are penetrated, the release can trigger explosions. Historically, if such a pocket was highly pressurized, it was termed a ""bag of foulness"". 

Name 

Damps is the collective name given to all gases (other than air) found in coal mines in England. The word corresponds to German Dampf, the  name for ""vapour"".  

Alongside firedamp, other damps include blackdamp (carbon dioxide and other gases), poisonous, explosive stinkdamp (hydrogen sulphide), with its characteristic ""rotten egg"" odour, and the insidiously lethal afterdamp (carbon monoxide and other gases)  produced following explosions of firedamp or coal dust.

Contribution to mine deaths

Firedamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most explosions occurring at around 10%. It caused much loss of life in coal mines before the invention of the Geordie lamp and Davy lamp. The invention was prompted by the Felling mine disaster near Newcastle upon Tyne claiming 92 lives on 25 May 1812. Davy experimented with iron gauze, determining the maximum size of the gaps and the optimum wire thickness to prevent a flame passing through the gauze. If a naked flame was thus enclosed totally by such a gauze, then methane could pass into the lamp and burn safely above the flame. He did not patent his invention.

Even after the safety lamps were brought into common use, firedamp explosions could still occur from sparks produced when coal contaminated with pyrites was struck with metal tools. The presence of coal dust in the air increased the risk of explosion with firedamp, and indeed could cause explosions itself.

The Tyneside coal mines in England had the deadly combination of bituminous coal contaminated with pyrites, and a great number of lives were lost in accidents due to firedamp explosions, including 102 dead at Wallsend in 1835. A continuous flame was produced at Whitehaven some time before 1733, described as being ""a yard wide and two yards long."" The miners dealt with it by piping it to the outside. 

Rather than the Davy lamp, Tyneside miners used the Geordie lamp, a similar safety lamp designed by George Stephenson. After the widespread introduction of the safety lamp, explosions continued because the early Davy lamps were fragile and easily damaged. The iron gauze for example only needed to lose one wire to become unsafe. The light was also very poor, and there were continuous attempts to improve the basic design. The height of the cone of burning methane in a flame safety lamp can be used to estimate the concentration of the gas in the local atmosphere. It was not until the 1890s that safe and reliable electric lamps became available in collieries.

Passage:
Pilote
Cover of the first Pilote teaser issue, #0.
Pilote was a French comic magazine published from 1959 to 1989. Showcasing most of the major French or Belgian comics talents of its day the magazine introduced major series such as Astérix, Barbe-Rouge, Blueberry, Achille Talon, and Valérian et Laureline.  Major comics writers like René Goscinny, Jean-Michel Charlier, Greg, Pierre Christin and Jacques Lob were featured in the magazine, as were artists such as Jijé, Morris, Albert Uderzo, Jean (Mœbius) Giraud, Enki Bilal, Jean-Claude Mézières, Jacques Tardi, Philippe Druillet, Marcel Gotlib, Alexis, and Annie Goetzinger.

Pilote also published several international talents such as Hugo Pratt, Frank Bellamy and Robert Crumb.

History

Following the publication of a teaser issue number 0 on June 1, Pilote made its debut proper on October 29, 1959.  The magazine was started by experienced comics writers Goscinny and Charlier, and artists Albert Uderzo and Jean Hébrard. Previously this team had worked together on several other projects, creating Le Supplément Illustré, a cartoon supplement for newspapers, and providing cartoons for Radio-Télé, a magazine published by Radio-Luxembourg.  Pilote was marketed by Radio-Luxembourg, and featured editorials written by popular radio personalities of the day. The 300,000 copies of the first issue sold out in one day.

Charlier and Goscinny handled most of the initial writing. Although Charlier came up with two popular series, Tanguy et Laverdure with Albert Uderzo and Barbe-Rouge (Redbeard) with Victor Hubinon, it was Goscinny and Uderzo’s Astérix le Gaulois which was the biggest hit and the magazine’s initial mainstay.

Difficulties

Financial problems arose in 1960, but were resolved when the magazine was bought out by Dargaud publishers. Dargaud expanded the magazine with several new series, including Charlier and Giraud’s Blueberry and Greg's Achille Tallon in 1963.  In 1967 the popular science-fiction series Valérian et Laureline debuted and in 1968 the popular Western comedy Lucky Luke (by Morris) was transferred to Pilote from Spirou magazine. Other notable appearances included series from the British comics magazine Eagle such as Fraser l'Africain (Fraser of Africa) and Winston Churchill by Frank Bellamy.

Attempts were made in the 1970s to update the magazine with material of more interest to adults, but many artists like Druillet and Giraud felt Pilote was no longer the appropriate vehicle for their aspirations and left to found new magazines such as Métal Hurlant (the French original that inspired Heavy Metal).  Partly as a result, Dargaud reduced Pilote’s publication schedule from weekly to monthly in 1974, and René Goscinny was replaced as editor-in-chief. At this time, a new generation of artists also started publishing in Pilote, namely Caza, Lauzier, and F'Murr. Their comics reflected the new, more adult direction.

Sales initially improved but a steady erosion took place through the 1980s as interest in the medium declined. Pilote was merged with the comics magazine Charlie Mensuel in 1986 and continued as Pilote et Charlie until 1988, when the name was changed back to Pilote.  However, declining sales prompted Dargaud to suspend publication after what became the final issue on October 1, 1989. 

After 1989, there has been no regular publications of the magazine, although the name has been used for occasional oversized specials.

In Thuluth, one-third of each letter slopes, from which the name (meaning ""a third"" in Arabic) comes. It is an elegant, cursive script, used in medieval times on mosque decorations. Various calligraphic styles evolved from Thul Ruth through slight changes of form. The best known artist to write the ThulUTH script at its zenith is said to be Mustafa Râkım Efendi (1757–1826), a painter who set a standard in Ottoman calligrapher which many believe has not been surpassed to this day. The script is used in the Flag of Saudi Arabia where its text, Shahada al Tawhid, is written in ThULuth. The rules governing the former are similar to the rules for any Arabic script. The stylistic marks have their own rules regarding placement and grouping which allow for great creativity as to shape and orientation. It was used to write headings of surahs, Qur'anic chapters and some of the oldest copies of the Qur'an. After the 15th century Naskh came to be used exclusively, and later Muhaqqaq was used as a replacement. It has given rise to a variety of scripts used in calligraphY and over time has allowed numerous, large panels, such as those seen on tombstones, to be written in it. The latter was probably derived from the styles Thululuth and NaskH, the latter itself having originated from the latter. Thulut was developed for use in use in tombstones and was developed by widening the horizontal sections of the letters in the letters. It also allows for greater delicacy, Tevki is a smaller version of Thulur, which is a less delicacy version of Tevk, and Tevky is a greater delicacies version of tevki. The name of the script is derived from a Turkish word for ""devil"" (devil) which means ""to kill"" or ""to destroy"" in English. It can be traced back to the 14th century and has been used since the 16th century. The first revolution occurred in the. first century and was initiated by the Master Calligraphers Şeyh Hamdullah and Hâfız Osman. The second revolution resulted from the work of the Ottoman. calligraphher HâFız. Osman in the 17th century, and the third in the late 19th. century, Mehmedkî EFendi gave the script the distinctive shape. In classical legend, the Amazons were a tribe of warrior women. Their name is supposedly derived from Greek a-mazos, ""without a breast,"" because according to the legend they cut off their right breasts so as to be better able to shoot with a bow and arrow. The historical Amazon were Scythians, an Iranian people renowned for their cavalry. People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. These sudden sleep attacks may occur during any type of activity at any time of the day. Some genes strongly associated with the disorder may signal the production of chemicals in the brain that control the sleep and awake cycles. The cause is not known; however, scientists have made progress toward identifying genes associated with this type of sleep disorder. For more information, visit the WebMD Narcolepsies website.

Narcolepsy involves multiple factors that interact to cause neurological dysfunction and REM sleep disturbances. A physical exam and exhaustive medical history are essential for proper diagnosis. The polysomnogram (PSG) and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) are considered essential in confirming a diagnosis of narcolepsia. The most disabling symptoms of the disorder (EDS and symptoms of abnormal REM sleep) can be controlled in most people with drug treatment. Sleepiness is treated with amphetamine -like stimulants, while the symptoms of normal REM sleep are treated with antidepressant drugs. There has recently been a new medication approved for those who suffer from narcoLEpsy with cataplexy. This drug, called Xyrem, helps people with narcollepsy get a better night's sleep, allowing them to be less sleepy during the day.

The next page is the next page, the next day, the third and the fourth. The fifth and the sixth are the last. Louis XIV was called the Grand Monarch or Sun King. His 72-year reign was the longest in modern European history. He brought France to its peak of absolute power. His absolutism brought him into conflict with the Huguenots and the papacy, with damaging repercussions. His many foreign wars became a financial burden, yet his long reign is associated with the greatest age of French culture, symbolized by the Palace of Versailles. He illustrated books by Charles Dickens, Charles Lever, and Harrison Ainsworth. He was the illegitimate son of his putative eldest sister Kate and Captain Nicholas Hablot of Napoleon's Imperial Guard. He died on 8 July 1882. He is buried at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, Surrey, England, on 21 June 1815, as does the record of his Christiaia, England burial service, from his copy of the Encyclopædica Eleventh Edition and Dictionary of National Biography. His great-great-granddaughter, Valerie Browne Lester, says he was born on 10 July 1815 in Lambeth (near London) on Kennington Lane. The date given by John Buchanan-Brown in his book Phiz!: illustrator of Dickens' world says 12 July 18 15. He had a son, Charles, who was born in 1815. He also had a daughter, Catherine, who died in 1820. He later became a well-known artist, known by his pen name, Phiz, and was the author of several books, including ""The Art of War"" and ""The War of the Spanish Sucession"" He was also the father of the artist and poet  Hablot Knight Browne, who lived from 1815 to 1882, and died in London in 1882 at the age of 83. He has been described as the ""greatest living Englishman of the 20th century"". He is also known as ""the greatest British artist of the 19th century"" and the ""father of the modern English language"" He is the grandfather of the British artist  James Bond, who starred in the film ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2"" He also served as the headmaster of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of England from 1881 to 1883. He wrote a book on the history of the London School of Music. Browne was apprenticed to William Finden, an engraver, in whose studio he obtained his only artistic education. He abandoned engraving in the following year and began other artistic work, with the ultimate object of becoming a painter. His first two etched plates for Pickwick were signed ""Nemo,"" but the third was signed ""Phiz,"" a pseudonym which was retained in future. He is most known for David Copperfield, Pickwick, Dombey and Son, Martin Chuzzlewit and Bleak House. Four of his illustrations were issued as stamps by the Royal Mail in 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens. In 1878 he was awarded an annuity by theRoyal Academy. His health gradually worsened until he died on 8 July 1882. He was buried in Kensal Rise, London, in front of a portrait of his father, William Browne, who he had painted when he was 7 years old. He died in 1882 at the age of 83, and was buried at Kensal Green, London. His wife Catherine died in 1913, and he died in 1918 at his home in London, where he had lived since 1836. He left a wife and three children, all of whom are still alive and living in the same house as he did in 1836, and a son and daughter-in-law who are also living in London. He had no children of his own and was married to Catherine's sister Ann Loder Browne. His last will and testament was published in 1838. He also illustrated more than twenty of Lever's novels (among them Harry Lorrequer, Charles O'Malley, Jack Hinton and the Knight of Gwynne) and also illustrated Harrison Ainsworth's and Frank Smedley's novels. He designed the wrapper which was used for eighteen months from January 1842 for Punch's Pocket Books. He suffered an illness that caused a degree of paralysis in 1867, when he produced many woodcuts. After recovering, he produced a series of woodcuts for Punch in 1878. His work was etched on steel plates because these yielded a far larger edition than copper. When manipulated with acid this tint gave an effect somewhat resembling mezzotint, which was found practically impossible to transfer to stone. The Mermaid Theatre was a theatre in Blackfriars, London. It was the most recently built in the City since the time of Shakespeare. A single tier of seats surrounded the stage on three sides. The theatre was the life's work of actor Bernard Miles with his wife, Josephine Wilson. It opened in 1959 with a successful production of Lock Up Your Daughters. In July 1961 the poet and author Sylvia Plath read her poem ""Tulips"" at the Poetry at the Mermaid Festival, sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain. A property company owned by Ugandan Asian businessman Abdul Shamji and his family bought the theatre in the mid-1980s in the hope of redeveloping the Puddle Dock site. In 2002 the theatre was slated for demolition as part of redevelopment plans. A preservation campaign by actors and other supporters attempted to reverse the decision. In April 2005 Mayor of London Ken Livingstone ordered the council to block the demolition. As of March 2005 plans had been submitted for a new theatre to be built on the site of the old Mermaid Theatre. The Mermaid Theatre is now owned by a private company and is open to the public for private performances.

In 2008 the Corporation of London City Planning Committee granted a certificate that stripped the former playhouse of its theatre status. The move may save the developer £6 million worth of Section 106 funding which it had previously agreed to pay in lieu if it closed the 600-seat Mermaid. The existing plans would see the Puddle Dock building converted into a conference centre and fitness suite, plus offices, a nightclub and retail and restaurant space. Campaigners are concerned that the entire building may be demolished. ""Fitz"" can be derived from Norman French, true, but that does not mean someone with a surname in Fitz- necessarily has Norman, French, or noble ancestry. The standard way to form a name using an Irish clan affiliation byname for men is:. <single given name> Ó <eponymous clan ancestor's name (in genitive case)>. ""Mc"" is Irish while Mac is Scottish (or vice versa) — actually Mc and Mac are two ways to write the same thing, and both occur in both countries. ""O'"" is almost exclusively Irish despite the romantic notions we have that that O is almost Irish; despite the fact that O' is almost Scottish, and Mc is Irish. ""Conchobhar"" means ""of the father's name"" – it comes from putting the name into the possessive case and (2) into the case of Conchadh, which means “son of” or “of” the father’s given name. “Fitz” also means ""son of"" and it clearly shows noble French Norman ancestry. ‘FitzRoy’ was used for bastard-names, so FitzRoy was a natural son of the king.  There are also various sorts of FitzWhatevers, like FitzWilliam or FitzCharles or FitzClarence — all originally “illegitimate” children, but sometimes not forever staying that way.’ “Conchadh” means male descendant of Fearchar mac Domhnaill, and ‘Conch’ means ‘son’ or ‘descendant’.      “Donnch” is a patronymic by name for men, and can mean ‘sons of’, which is the most common way to write a name for a man. ‚’ “” “‘”  ‘’ ” – “conch  is a common name for women,” meaning ‘to give birth to a child’ Daewoo Nubira is a compact car which was produced by South Korean automaker Daewoo from 1997 to 2002 as a sedan, hatchback, and wagon. Built in Kunsan, South Korea in a factory equipped with sophisticated laser-guided robots, it was developed as a replacement for the Daewo Nexia and styled in Italy by Italian I.DE.A Institute. In North America, the cars are relatively obscure, if not rare, and sourcing parts for them became relatively difficult; though many powertrain parts were shared worldwide with other GM platforms (Opel, Holden, Isuzu). In Australia, Holden produced 24 DOHC DOHCve 24.0 DOHCves. In the U.S. only the base SE models, (mid range SX only available for 1999) or the premium CDX with standard features such as ABS, heated mirrors, cruise control, in-dash CD player and optional seating and power of 2.4 liters. In Australia the car was only available with an optional 16-valec-liter General Motors ""D-Tec"" gasoline engine paired with either a 4-20 manual or 5-20 trans-axle auto. Producing 136 lb-ft of torque at 4,400 rpm, the GM Family-II had a 3 square-4"" bore and at 5,400rpm making 129 bhrs. The name was chosen to convey the aspiration that this car would be seen crisscrossing every corner of the globe. Over 90 improvements were made by Daewoos' Worthing Technical Centre in the United Kingdom, including an increase in passenger space and a decrease in noise, harshness and vibration (by adding a fourth engine mount and retuning the intake resonators for example). Offset crash performance was further improved in the second generation, as demonstrated by Australian ANCAP tests, though it fell well short of exemplary performance. The exterior was reworked, creating a more dynamic upright and swept look of the era, a design later seen reflected by the Lexus ES350 and 2004 Mitsubishi Diamante. Buyers could opt for either the Base SE models (mid-range SX onlyavailable for 1999), or the Premium CDX, with standard ABS and heated mirrors. The base SE model was available for model year 1999, while the premiumCDX was available from model year 2000, with optional ABS and cruise control. Firedamp is the name given to a number of flammable gases. It is found in areas where the coal is bituminous. It caused the death of 102 miners in the Tyne-Wear disaster in 1812. The Nubira was produced in a former GM factory in Egypt. It was replaced by a new model in 2004. It has a 1.8-litre engine and a 2.0-litres engine in the U.S. It will be sold in the United States as the Chevrolet Nubiras.

Major comics writers like René Goscinny, Jean-Michel Charlier, Greg, Pierre Christin and Jacques Lob were featured in the magazine. Pilote was merged with the comics magazine Charlie Mensuel in 1986 and continued as Pilote et Charlie until 1988, when the name was changed back to Pilote. declining sales prompted Dargaud to suspend publication after what became the final issue on October 1, 1989. After 1989, there has been no regular publications of the magazine, although the name has been used for occasional oversized specials. The last issue of Pilote appeared on October 29, 1989, and was the last issue to be published by the publisher. The final issue was published on October 31, 1990, and featured the last ever Pilote cartoon by Jean-Claude Mézières, Jacques Tardi, Philippe Druillet, Marcel Gotlib, Alexis, and Annie Goetzinger. The magazine was published by Radio-Luxembourg and featured editorials written by popular radio personalities of the day. The 300,000 copies of the first issue sold out in one day, and the magazine’s initial mainstay was Asterix le Gaulois. In 1967 the popular science-fiction series Valérians et Laurelines debuted. Other notable appearances included series from the British comics magazine Eagle such as Fraser l'Africain (Fraser of Africa) and Winston Churchill by Frank Bellamy. At this time, a new generation of artists also started publishing in Pilote, namely Caza, Lauzier, and F'Murr. Their comics reflected the new, more adult direction. In the 1970s, many artists left Pilote to found new magazines such as Métal Hurlant (the French original that inspired Heavy Metal) and left to find new magazines like the French original of the same name. In 1986, Pilote became the only French magazine to publish a weekly comic book magazine. The first issue of the second issue of that issue was released on October 28, 1986. The second issue was the first of the third issue of this issue, on October 30, 1987, and it was the second of the fourth issue. The third issue was issued on October 27, 1987. The fourth and final issue of these issues was the issue that became the last one of the series, published on November 1, 1988. The Mirror World Asterix exhibition opens in Paris. Asterix first appeared in French in the magazine Pilote on 29 October 1959. The exhibition is open until the end of the month. It is open to the public.

Suidae
Suidae is a family of artiodactyl mammals commonly called ""pigs"", hogs, or boars.  In addition to numerous fossil species, up to sixteen extant species are currently recognized, classified into between four and eight genera. The family includes the domestic pig, Sus scrofa domesticus or Sus domesticus, in addition to numerous species of wild pig, such as the babirusa Babyrousa babyrussa and the warthog Phacochoerus aethiopicus. All suids, or swine, are native to the Old World, ranging from Asia and its islands, to Europe, and Africa.

The earliest fossil suids date from the Oligocene epoch of Asia, and their descendants reached Europe during the Miocene.  Several fossil species are known, and show adaptations to a wide range of different diets, from strict herbivory to possible carrion-eating (in Tetraconodon).

Physical characteristics

Suids belong to the order Artiodactyla, and are generally regarded as the living members of that order most similar to the ancestral form. Unlike most other members of the order, they have four toes on each foot, although they walk only on the middle two digits, with the others staying clear of the ground. They also have a simple stomach, rather than the more complex, ruminant, stomach found in most other artiodactyl families.

They are small to medium animals, varying in size from 58 to in length, and 6 to in weight in the case of the pygmy hog, to 130 - and 100 - in the giant forest hog.  They have large heads and short necks, with relatively small eyes and prominent ears. Their heads have a distinctive snout, ending in a disc-shaped nose. Suids typically have a bristly coat, and a short tail ending in a tassle. The males possess a corkscrew-shaped penis, which fits into a similarly shaped groove in the female's cervix.   

Suids have a well-developed sense of hearing, and are vocal animals, communicating with a series of grunts, squeals, and similar sounds. They also have an acute sense of smell. Many species are omnivorous, eating grass, leaves, roots, insects, worms, and even frogs or mice. Other species are more selective and purely herbivorous.

Their teeth reflect their diet, and suids retain the upper incisors, which are lost in most other Artiodactyls. The canine teeth are enlarged to form prominent tusks, used for rooting in moist earth or undergrowth, and in fighting. They have only a short diastema. The number of teeth varies between species, but the general dental formula is: 

Behaviour and reproduction

Suids are intelligent and adaptable animals. Adult females (sows) and their young travel in a group (sounder; see List of animal names), while adult males (boars) are either solitary, or travel in small bachelor groups. Males generally are not territorial, and come into conflict only during the mating season.

Litter size varies between one and twelve, depending on the species. The mother prepares a grass nest or similar den, which the young leave after about ten days. Suids are weaned at around three months, and become sexually mature at 18 months. In practice, however, male suids are unlikely to gain access to sows in the wild until they have reached their full physical size, at around four years of age. In all species, the male is significantly larger than the female, and possesses more prominent tusks.

Lester Errol Brown MBE (12 November 1943 – 6 May 2015) was a British-Jamaican singer and songwriter, best known as the frontman of the soul and funk band Hot Chocolate.  

Career

Brown was born in Kingston, Jamaica, but moved to the UK when he was twelve years old. His break in music came in 1969 when he recorded a version of John Lennon's ""Give Peace a Chance"" with a band called ""Hot Chocolate Band"". Unable to change the lyrics without Lennon's permission, he sent a copy to his record label, Apple, and the song was released with Lennon's approval. 

The Hot Chocolate albums were produced by Mickie Most and recorded at the Rak Records studio. Brown left the group in 1985 to take a hiatus from music.   He soon went on to have a solo career, achieving success in the clubs with the 1987 single ""Body Rocking"", produced by Richard James Burgess. 

Brown was a supporter of the Conservative Party and performed at a party conference in the 1980s. In 1981, he performed at the wedding reception following the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, at Buckingham Palace. 

Brown owned National Hunt horses, including Gainsay. 

Recognition

In 2003, Queen Elizabeth II named Brown a Member of the Order of the British Empire for ""services to popular music for the United Kingdom"".   In 2004 he received an Ivor Novello Award for outstanding contributions to British music.

Death

Brown died of liver cancer at his home in the Bahamas on 6 May 2015. He is survived by his wife Ginette and his two daughters, Colette and Leonie.

Speyside Way
The Speyside Way (Doric: '; ) is one of Scotland's Great Trails that follows the River Spey through some of Banffshire, Morayshire and Inverness-shire's most beautiful scenery. It is one of four Long Distance Routes in Scotland. It begins in Aviemore and ends at Buckpool harbour in Buckie, some 65 miles away. Some choose to walk the route from Buckie to Aviemore.  There is a spur leading off the main route to Tomintoul bringing the total distance up to 80 miles (130 km). In addition, there is a Dufftown loop option, and other less well-known routes (Badenoch Way, Dava Way, and Moray Coast Trail) can be worked in, all affecting the total distance walked.  Sections of the route are open to cycling.

The Way is clearly marked with a symbol showing a thistle in a hexagon.  The route generally follows the valley of the River Spey, passing some of the distilleries that produce Speyside single malts. The final five miles from Spey Bay to Buckie follow the coastline.

An extension of the route from Aviemore to Newtonmore is currently being progressed. This extension would lengthen the total route by , roughly following the route of the River Spey and utilising part of the Sustrans cycle route. The first part of the extension, to Kincraig, was opened in 2015.

A formal proposal has now been submitted and has received approval in principle from Scottish Ministers, but it still looks likely that not all landowners will be in agreement with the designated route. If instructed by the Scottish Ministers, the Cairngorms National Park Authority can implement the route against landowners' wishes under the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 and the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Negotiations are still underway to attempt to avoid this situation.

The path follows most of the route of the former Strathspey Railway.

Passage:
Aare
The Aare or Aar is a tributary of the High Rhine and the longest river that both rises and ends entirely within Switzerland.

Its total length from its source to its junction with the Rhine comprises about 295 km (183 miles), during which distance it descends 1565 m, draining an area of 17779 km2, almost entirely within Switzerland, and accounting for close to half the area of the country, including all of Central Switzerland.  
There are more than 40 hydroelectric plants along the course of the Aare River.

The river's name dates to at least the La Tène period, and it is attested as Nantaror ""Aare valley"" in the Berne zinc tablet which dates back to Roman Gaul. 
The name was Latinized as Arula/Arola/Araris. 

Course

The Aare rises in the great Aargletschers (Aare Glaciers) of the Bernese Alps, in the canton of Bern and west of the Grimsel Pass. The Finsteraargletscher and Lauteraargletscher come together to form the Unteraargletscher (Lower Aare-Glacier), which is the main source of water for the Grimselsee. The Oberaargletscher (Upper Aare-Glacier) feeds the Oberaarsee, which also flows into the Grimselsee. The Aare river leaves the Grimselsee just to the east to the Grimsel Hospice, below the Grimsel Pass, and then flows northwest through the Haslital, forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall, 46 m, past Guttannen.

Between Innertkirchen and Meiringen, the river carves through a limestone ridge in the Aare Gorge or Aareschlucht. It is here that the Aare proves itself to be more than just a river, as it attracts thousands of tourists annually to the causeways through the gorge. A little past Meiringen, near Brienz, the river expands into Lake Brienz. Near the west end of the lake it receives its first important tributary, the Lütschine. It then runs across the swampy plain of the Bödeli between Interlaken and Unterseen before flowing into Lake Thun.

Near the west end of Lake Thun, the river receives the waters of the Kander, which has just been joined by the Simme. Lake Thun marks the head of navigation. On flowing out of the lake it passes through Thun, and then flows through the city of Bern, passing beneath eighteen bridges and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the Old City is located. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the Saane or Sarine it turns north until it nears Aarberg. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the Jura water correction, the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a swampland through frequent flooding, was diverted by the Hagneck Canal into the Lake of Bienne. From the upper end of the lake, at Nidau, the river issues through the Nidau-Büren channel, also called the Aare Canal, and then runs east to Büren. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the ""vegetable garden of Switzerland"".

From here the Aare flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town Solothurn (below which the Grosse Emme flows in on the right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger), Olten, Aarau, near which is the junction with the Suhre, and Wildegg, where the Bünz falls in on the right. A short distance further, below Brugg it receives first the Reuss, and shortly afterwards the Limmat. It now turns due north, and soon becomes itself a tributary of the Rhine, which it surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite at Koblenz (Switzerland), opposite Waldshut, Germany.  The Rhine, in turn, empties into the North Sea after crossing into the Netherlands.

Digitalis purpurea
Digitalis purpurea (foxglove, common foxglove, purple foxglove or lady's glove) is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family Plantaginaceae, native and widespread throughout most of temperate Europe. It is also naturalised in parts of North America and some other temperate regions. The plants are well known as the original source of the heart medicine digoxin (also called digitalis or digitalin).

Description

Digitalis purpurea is an herbaceous biennial or short-lived perennial plant. The leaves are spirally arranged, simple,  long and  broad, and are covered with gray-white pubescent and glandular hairs, imparting a woolly texture. The foliage forms a tight rosette at ground level in the first year.

The flowering stem develops in the second year, typically  tall, sometimes longer. The flowers are arranged in a showy, terminal, elongated cluster, and each flower is tubular and pendent. The flowers are typically purple, but some plants, especially those under cultivation, may be pink, rose, yellow, or white. The inside surface of the flower tube is heavily spotted. The flowering period is early summer, sometimes with additional flower stems developing later in the season. The plant is frequented by bees, which climb right inside the flower tube to gain the nectar within.

The fruit is a capsule which splits open at maturity to release the numerous tiny 0.1-0.2 mm seeds.

Subspecies

The three subspecies of Digitalis purpurea are:
*D. p. subsp. purpurea – most of Europe
*D. p. subsp. heywoodii – Iberia
*D. p. subsp. mariana – Iberia

Hybrids

* Digitalis x fulva, Lindl. 1821 (hybrid formula: Digitalis grandiflora Mill. × Digitalis purpurea L.).

Toxicity 

Due to the presence of the cardiac glycoside digitoxin, the leaves, flowers and seeds of this plant are all poisonous to humans and some animals and can be fatal if ingested.

Extracted from the leaves, this same compound, whose clinical use was pioneered as digitalis by William Withering, is used as a medication for heart failure. He recognized it ""reduced dropsy"", increased urine flow and had a powerful effect on the heart. Unlike the purified pharmacological forms, extracts of this plant did not frequently cause intoxication because they induced nausea and vomiting within minutes of ingestion, preventing the patient from consuming more.

The main toxins in Digitalis spp. are the two chemically similar cardiac glycosides: digitoxin and digoxin. Like other cardiac glycosides, these toxins exert their effects by inhibiting the ATPase activity of a complex of transmembrane proteins that form the sodium potassium ATPase pump, (Na+/K+-ATPase). Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase in turn causes a rise not only in intracellular Na+, but also in calcium, which in turn results in increased force of myocardial muscle contractions. In other words, at precisely the right dosage, Digitalis toxin can cause the heart to beat more strongly. However, digitoxin, digoxin and several other cardiac glycosides, such as ouabain, are known to have steep dose-response curves, i.e., minute increases in the dosage of these drugs can make the difference between an ineffective dose and a fatal one.

Symptoms of Digitalis poisoning include a low pulse rate, nausea, vomiting, and uncoordinated contractions of different parts of the heart, leading to cardiac arrest and finally death.

Cultivation 

The plant is popular as a garden subject, and numerous cultivars have been developed with a range of colours from white through pink to purple, such as ""Dalmatian Purple"". Cultivated forms often show flowers completely surrounding the central spike, in contrast to the wild form, where the flowers only appear on one side.  D. purpurea is easily grown from seed or purchased as potted plants in the spring. The following selections have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:
*'The Shirley' 
*'Excelsior group' 
*D. purpurea f. alba 

Digitalis purpurea is hardy to zones 4-9. 

Uses

Digoxigenin (DIG) is a steroid found exclusively in the flowers and leaves of the plants Digitalis purpurea and Digitalis lanata. It is used as a molecular probe to detect DNA or RNA. It can easily be attached to nucleotides by chemical modifications. DIG molecules are often linked to uridine nucleotides; DIG-labeled uridine (DIG-U) can then be incorporated into RNA probes via in vitro transcription. Once hybridisation occurs in situ, RNA probes with the incorporated DIG-U can be detected with anti-DIG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. To reveal the hybridised transcripts, alkaline phosphatase can be reacted with a chromogen to produce a coloured precipitate.

Genetics

The colours of the petals of the Digitalis purpurea are known to be determined by at least three genes that interact with each other. 

The M gene determined the production of a purple pigment, a type of antocianin. The m gene does not produce this pigment. The D gene is an enhances of the M gene, and leads it to produce a big amount of the pigment. The d gene does not enhance the M gene, and only a small amount of pigment is produced. Lastly, the W gene makes the pigment be deposited only in some spots, while the w gene allows the pigment to be spread all over the flower.

This combination leads to four phenotypes:

*M/_; W/_; _/_ = a white flower with purple spots;
*m/m; _/_; _/_ = an albino flower with yellow spots;
*M/_; w/w; d/d = a light purple flower;
*M/_; w/w; D/_ = a dark purple flower.

In popular culture

This plant inspired a famous poem by the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli titled ""Digitale Purpurea"". It also inspired the Italian industrial metal band Digitalis Purpurea.

This plant features in the 2015 video game Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It is one of several harvestable plants within the game, and is used for the production of tranquilizer rounds by the Mother Base R&D team

A Rake's Progress
A Rake's Progress is a series of eight paintings by 18th-century English artist William Hogarth. The canvases were produced in 1732–33, then engraved and published in print form in 1734. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and ultimately Bethlem Hospital, or Bedlam.  The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display.

The filmmaker Alan Parker has described the works as an ancestor to the storyboard. 

Paintings

Adaptations

Gavin Gordon wrote a 1935 ballet titled The Rake's Progress, based directly on Hogarth's paintings. It was choreographed by Ninette de Valois, designed by Rex Whistler, has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies.

The 1946 RKO film Bedlam, produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rake's Progress. Hogarth received a writing credit for the film.

Igor Stravinsky's 1951 opera The Rake's Progress, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is loosely based on the story from Hogarth's paintings. In 1961, David Hockney created his own print edition version of The Rake's Progress; he has also created stage designs for the Stravinsky Opera.

The University of New Hampshire's Department of Theatre and Dance created a collaborative stage show titled ""The Rake's Progress"" in 2003, which, with 17 actors and actresses, provided an intensive study of the etchings.
Question:
Who painted The Rake's Progress?
Answer:

Passage:
Nine Elms
Nine Elms is a district of London, situated in the far north-eastern corner of the London Borough of Wandsworth between Battersea and Vauxhall in the neighbouring borough of Lambeth.

The area was formerly mainly industrial but is now becoming more residential and commercial in character. It is dominated by Battersea Power Station, various railway lines and New Covent Garden Market. Also in the area is the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.

Nine Elms has residential developments along the riverside, like Chelsea Bridge Wharf or Embassy Gardens, and also three large council estates—Carey Gardens, the Patmore and the Savona.

History

Nine Elms Lane was named around 1645, from a row of elm trees bordering the road. In 1838, at the time of construction of the London and Southampton Railway, the area was described as ""a low swampy district occasionally overflowed by the Thames [whose] osier beds, pollards and windmille and the river give it a Dutch effect"".

Nine Elms railway station opened on 21 May 1838 as the first London terminus of the London and South Western Railway, which that day changed its name from the London and Southampton Railway. The neo-classical building was designed by Sir William Tite. The station was connected to points between Vauxhall and London Bridge by Thames steam boats. It closed in 1848 when the railway was extended to a new terminus at Waterloo station (then called Waterloo Bridge Station). The redundant station and the adjacent area, to the north of the new mainline, became the London and South Western Railway's carriage and wagon works and main locomotive works until their relocation to Eastleigh in 1909.  The company's largest locomotive depot was located on the south side of the main line. The buildings were damaged by bombs in World War II, and closed in 1967. They were demolished in 1968 and replaced by the flower section of the New Covent Garden Market. 

Gasworks were established in 1853, close to the existing waterworks of the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company. Later Battersea Power Station was built on the site.

Vauxhall Motors was formed in 1857 by Scottish engineer Alexander Wilson at Nine Elms, originally as Alex Wilson and Company, before moving to Luton in 1907. There is a plaque commemorating the site of the original factory at the Sainsbury's Nine Elms petrol station on Wandsworth Road.

Future

In October 2008 the U.S. Embassy in London announced that it would relocate to the area, moving from its current location in Grosvenor Square, Mayfair;  the new embassy is slated for completion in 2017.  The Embassy of the Netherlands in London also announced in April 2013 that it was relocating to the area from its current location in Hyde Park Gate, Kensington.  The Chinese Embassy is also rumoured to be relocating to the area. 

On 16 February 2012, Wandsworth Council approved Ballymore Group's plans for the 15 acre development. Embassy Gardens is set to provide ""up to 1,982 new homes alongside shops, cafes, bars, restaurants, business space, a 100 bed hotel, a health centre, children's playgrounds and sports pitches"".Wandsworth Council: [http://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/news/article/11030/embassy_gardens_plans_approved Embassy Gardens plans approved | Wandsworth Council], accessdate: 9 September 2014 In 2014, it was reported that Ballymore had engaged Lazard and CBRE Group to raise about €2.5bn to fund the Embassy Gardens development.Independent.ie: [http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/nick-webb-mulryan-is-close-to-wiping-slate-clean-30301129.html Nick Webb: Mulryan is close to wiping slate clean - Independent.ie], accessdate: 1 September 2014

Work commenced in 2013 on regeneration of the area around Battersea Power Station, including shops, cafes, restaurants, art and leisure facilities, office space and residential buildings. An essential part of the work is an extension of the London Underground to service the area. The proposed extension would branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elms and Battersea - creating two new stations.  The station structure itself is expected to be repaired and secure by 2016, with completion of the whole project by 2020.

Part of these plans is the creation of the linear park – a car-free area extending from Battersea Power Station to Vauxhall Cross. The park will open out onto other public areas such as shops, hotels and other parks and public squares alongside homes and residential areas.The linear park will open up onto the Thames River Path at numerous points along the path, allowing access to the river’s edge and the beautiful views so rare in urban areas. 

In 2015, Wandsworth council chose a design by Bystrup for a £40m pedestrian bridge between Nine Elms and Pimlico.

Pubs in Covent Garden
Passage:
Tim Gudgin
Tim Gudgin (born 26 November 1929) is a retired British radio presenter and voiceover artist. He was best known for announcing the football results on the BBC sports programmes Grandstand and Final Score between 1995 and 2011. He read the results out for the last time on 19 November 2011, just a week before his 82nd birthday. 

Education and early career

He was educated at the independent Whitgift School in South Croydon, London, but did not go to university. He carried out his National Service during the 1940s, and he started his broadcasting career during that time in Germany in 1949. After completing his National Service he started a long career at the BBC.

Grandstand and Final Score

He began working on Grandstand in the 1960s, initially announcing the rugby and racing results, but then succeeded Len Martin as the broadcaster of the football results after Martin's death in 1995. Gudgin was only the second person to perform the role regularly from the inception of Grandstand in 1958. After Grandstand ended in 2007, he continued to read the results on Final Score.

Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker described Gudgin as ""one of the most familiar voices in sport"" and ""a quintessential part of Saturday afternoons in this country"".   

Other work

His voice has been heard on the BBC Radio 4 quiz Quote... Unquote, Housewives' Choice, Top of the Form and Friday Night is Music Night, amongst others. Interviewed in November 2011 Gudgin said, ""I did an in-vision commercial for Square Deal Surf which bought me the first house I ever had without a mortgage, so that was well worth it."" 

Personal life

Gudgin is a Crystal Palace supporter and lives in Emsworth, Hampshire. He is also said to be a fan of The Fall and once persuaded Mark E. Smith to read the football scores.[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/03/01/fighting_sailors_filthy_dunkin.html Guardian Unlimited: Sport blog: Fighting sailors, filthy dunks and the genius of Jean-Pierre Papin]

Retirement

He announced just prior to reading the results on the 6 August 2011 that the 2011-2012 season would be his last before retirement, with his last reading on 19 November 2011.  He later cited several reasons for his retirement including his age, the distance he would have to travel following the BBC's relocation to Salford and his granddaughter's wedding in Australia which he wanted to be there for.

His successor on Final Score is Mike West, who was the presenter of sports bulletins on BBC Radio Lancashire.

Most prolific mother ever
Where
Russia Shuya
The greatest officially recorded number of children born to one mother is 69, to the wife of Feodor Vassilyev (b. 1707–c.1782), a peasant from Shuya, Russia. In 27 confinements she gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets.
***
Numerous contemporaneous sources exist, which suggest that this seemingly improbably and statistically unlikely story is true.
The case was reported to Moscow by the Monastery of Nikolsk on 27 Feb 1782, which had recorded every birth. It is noted that, by this time, only two of the children who were born in the period c. 1725–65 failed to survive their infancy.
The Gentleman's Magazine (1783, 53, 753) recounts: ""In an original letter now before me, dated St Petersburg, Aug 13, 1782, O. S. Feodor Wassilief [sic], aged 75, a peasant, said to be now alive and in perfect health, in the Government of Moscow, has had–
By his first wife:
---------
8 births 18 children
In all, 35 births, 87 children, of which 84 are living and only three buried. . . The above relation, however astonishing, may be depended upon, as it came directly from an English merchant at St Petersburg to his relatives in England, who added that the peasant was to be introduced to the Empress.""
In Saint Petersburg Panorama, Bashutski, 1834, the author notes that:
""In the day of 27 February 1782, the list from Nikolskiy monastery came to Moscow containing the information that a peasant of the Shuya  district, Feodor Vassilyev, married twice, had 87 children. His first wife in 27 confinements gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets. His second wife in eight confinements gave birth to six pairs of twins and two sets of triplets. F. Vassilyev was 75 at that time with 82 of his children alive.""
And the Lancet (1878) refers to a twin study carried out by the French Academy and:
""Apropos of the enquiry, the Committee of the Academy recall an account of a quite extraordinary fecundity that was published by M. Hermann in his ""Travaux Statistiques de la Russie,"" for Fedor Vassilet [sic]. . . who, in 1782, was aged 75 years, had had, by two wives, 87 children.""
Aside from this, not much is known about the first Mrs Vassilyev - even her first name (although some sources claim her name was Valentina).
It is thought she lived to the age of 76.
Although this historic record should be taken with a pinch of salt, it is certainly conceivable that Mrs Vassilyev could have had a genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate (release multiple eggs in one cycle), which significantly increases the chance of having twins or multiple children.
It is also not impossible for a woman to have 27 pregnancies during her fertile years.

Uraninite
Uraninite, formerly pitchblende, is a radioactive, uranium-rich mineral and ore with a chemical composition that is largely UO2, but due to oxidation the mineral typically contains variable proportions of U3O8. Additionally, due to radioactive decay, the ore also contains oxides of lead and trace amounts of helium. It may also contain thorium, and rare earth elements.

It used to be known as pitchblende (from pitch, because of its black color, and blende, a term used by German miners to denote minerals whose density suggested metal content, but whose exploitation, at the time they were named, was either unknown, impossible or not economically feasible). The mineral has been known at least since the 15th century from silver mines in the Ore Mountains, on the German/Czech border. The type locality is the historic mining and spa town known as Joachimsthal, the modern day Jáchymov, on the Czech side of the mountains, where F.E. Brückmann described the mineral in 1772. Pitchblende from the Johanngeorgenstadt deposit in Germany was used by M. Klaproth in 1789 to discover the element uranium. 

All uraninite minerals contain a small amount of radium as a radioactive decay product of uranium. Marie Curie used pitchblende, processing tons of it herself, as the source material for her isolation of radium in 1898.

Uraninite also always contains small amounts of the lead isotopes 206Pb and 207Pb, the end products of the decay series of the uranium isotopes 238U and 235U respectively. Small amounts of helium are also present in uraninite as a result of alpha decay. Helium was first found on Earth in uraninite after having been discovered spectroscopically in the Sun's atmosphere. The extremely rare elements technetium and promethium can be found in uraninite in very small quantities (about 200 pg/kg and 4 fg/kg respectively), produced by the spontaneous fission of uranium-238.

Occurrence

Uraninite is a major ore of uranium. Some of the highest grade uranium ores in the world were found in the Shinkolobwe mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the initial source for the Manhattan Project) and in the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, Canada.  Another important source of pitchblende is at Great Bear Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada, where it is found in large quantities associated with silver. It also occurs in Australia, the Czech Republic, Germany, England, Rwanda and South Africa. In the United States it can be found in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina and Wyoming. The geologist Charles Steen made a fortune on the production of Uraninite in his Mi Vida mine in Moab, Utah.

Uranium ore is generally processed close to the mine into yellowcake, which is an intermediate step in the processing of uranium.
Question:
Pitchblende is the chief ore of which metallic element?
Answer:
234U
Passage:
Finnegan's Wake
""Finnegan's Wake"" is a ballad that arose in the 1850s in the music-hall tradition of comical Irish songs. The song was a staple of the Irish folk-music group the Dubliners, who played it on many occasions and included it on several albums, and is especially well known to fans of the Clancy Brothers, who have performed and recorded it with Tommy Makem. The song has more recently been recorded by Irish-American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys. The song is also a staple in the repertoire of Irish folk band the High Kings, as well as Darby O'Gill, whose version incorporates and encourages audience participation.

Summary

In the ballad, the hod-carrier Tim Finnegan, born ""with a love for the liquor"", falls from a ladder, breaks his skull, and is thought to be dead. The mourners at his wake become rowdy, and spill whiskey over Finnegan's corpse, causing him to come back to life and join in the celebrations. Whiskey causes both Finnegan's fall and his resurrection—whiskey is derived from the Irish phrase uisce beatha, meaning ""water of life"".

Non-English phrases:
*Thanam 'on dhoul (Irish: Th'anam 'on diabhal, ""your soul to the devil"") However, in other versions of the song, Tim says ""Thunderin' Jaysus.""

Use in literature 

The song is famous for providing the basis of James Joyce's final work, Finnegans Wake (1939), in which the comic resurrection of Tim Finnegan is employed as a symbol of the universal cycle of life. As whiskey, the ""water of life"", causes both Finnegan's death and resurrection in the ballad, so the word ""wake"" also represents both a passing (into death) and a rising (from sleep). Joyce removed the apostrophe in the title of his novel to suggest an active process in which a multiplicity of ""Finnegans"", that is, all members of humanity, fall and then wake and arise.  

""Finnegan's Wake"" is featured as the climax of the primary storyline in Philip José Farmer's award-winning novella, Riders of the Purple Wage.

Passage:
Frame drum
A frame drum is a drum that has a drumhead width greater than its depth. Usually the single drumhead is made of rawhide or man-made materials. Shells are traditionally constructed of bent wood (rosewood, oak, ash etc.) scarf jointed together; plywood and man-made materials are also used. Some frame drums have mechanical tuning and on many the drumhead is stretched and tacked in place. It is the earliest skin drum known to have existed. Examples are found in many places and cultures. It has been suggested  that they were also used to winnow grain.

The frame drum is one of the most ancient musical instruments; it is reputed to be the first drum to be invented. Frame drums are often constructed with a round, wooden frame. Metal rings or jingles may also be attached to the frame. Larger frame drums are played mainly by men in spiritual ceremonies; medium-size drums are played mainly by women.

He was best known as the frontman of the soul and funk band Hot Chocolate. Brown was born in Kingston, Jamaica, but moved to the UK when he was twelve years old. His break in music came in 1969 when he recorded a version of John Lennon's ""Give Peace a Chance"" with a band called ""Hot Chocolate Band"" Brown died of liver cancer at his home in the Bahamas on 6 May 2015. He is survived by his wife Ginette and his two daughters, Colette and Leonie. In 2003, Queen Elizabeth II named Brown a Member of the Order of the British Empire for ""services to popular music for the United Kingdom"" In 2004 he received an Ivor Novello Award for outstanding contributions to British music. Brown owned National Hunt horses, including Gainsay. He also had a successful solo career, achieving success in the clubs with the 1987 single ""Body Rocking"" Brown was a supporter of the Conservative Party and performed at a party conference in the 1980s. He had two children with his wife, Ginette, and two daughters with her, Leonie and Colette. Brown also had two sons with his ex-wife, Joanne, and a son with his current wife, Jennifer, who he had with his daughter Colette, and son-in-law, David, who is also a singer-songwriter. Brown had three children with two different women, including his daughter Joanne Brown, with whom he had a son, David Brown, who has a daughter, Jennifer Brown, and daughter- in-law Colette Brown. His son David Brown had a daughter with one of his daughters, Toni Brown, whom he also had an affair with. He died in May 2015 at the age of 69, after a long battle with liver cancer. He leaves behind a wife and two children, David and Toni, as well as a son David, a musician and a father-of-two. Brown is buried in Kensington, London, in a plot of land he inherited from his father, which he bought in the 1950s and 1960s. His daughter Toni has a son called David Brown Brown, also a musician, who lives in London. Brown died in a house fire that he built in the early 1990s in a bid to raise money for charity. He left the group in 1985 to take a hiatus from music, and went on to have a solo career. He recorded in the 1990s with the band Secret Rendezvous. The Speyside Way (Doric: '; ) is one of Scotland's Great Trails that follows the River Spey through some of Banffshire, Morayshire and Inverness-shire's most beautiful scenery. It begins in Aviemore and ends at Buckpool harbour in Buckie, some 65 miles away. There is a spur leading off the main route to Tomintoul bringing the total distance up to 80 miles (130 km) There is also a Dufftown loop option, and other less well-known routes (Badenoch Way, Dava Way, and Moray Coast Trail) can be worked in. Sections of the route are open to cycling. The route is clearly marked with a symbol showing a thistle in a hexagon. It generally follows the valley of the Spey, passing some of the distilleries that produce Speysid single malts. The final five miles from Spey Bay to Buckie follow the coastline. An extension of the. route from Aviemur to Newtonmore is currently being progressed. This extension would lengthen the total route by, roughly following the route of the Riverspey and. utilising part of the Sustrans cycle route. A formal proposal has now been submitted and has received approval in principle from Scottish Ministers, but it still looks likely that not all landowners will be in agreement with the designated route. The Aare or Aar is a tributary of the High Rhine and the longest river that both rises and ends entirely within Switzerland. It dates back to at least the La Tène period and it is attested as Nantarized as ""Aare in Berne"" or ""Aar in the Berne valley"" in Roman Gaul. The name was later changed to Arula/Arola/Araris and is now used as a name for the Aare Valley in Switzerland. There are more than 40 hydroelectric plants along the course of the river, including all of Central Switzerland, and it dates back as far as the Nantor period of the 4th century BC. The path follows most of the path of the former Strathspey Railway. It is currently open to walking and cycling, with some sections being open to cycle and walking only. It follows the same route as the Aar, which was used by the Romans. The Aare rises in the great Aargletschers (Aare Glaciers) of the Bernese Alps, in the canton of Bern and west of the Grimsel Pass. The Aare river is a tributary of the Rhine, which it surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite at Koblenz (Switzerland), opposite Waldshut, Germany. It flows through the city of Bern, passing beneath eighteen bridges and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the Old City is located. The river flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town Solothurn (below which the Grosse Emme flows in on the right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger), Olten, Aarau, near which is the junction with the Suhre, and Wildegg. A little past Meiringen, near Brienz, the river expands into Lake BrienZ. It then runs across the swampy plain of the Bödeli between Interlaken and Unterseen before flowing into Lake Thun. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the ""vegetable garden of Switzerland"" The river then flows north until it nears Aarberg. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the Jura water correction was diverted by the Hagneck Canal into the Lake of Bienne. It now turns due north, and soon becomes itself aTributary.  The Rhine empties into the North Sea after crossing into the Netherlands, and into Lake Zürich after crossing the River Rhine into the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It also flows into the Adriatic Sea and the Baltic Sea, and then into the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is the source of the Unteraargletscher (Lower Aare-Glacier) and the Oberaarsee, which are the main source of water for the Grimselssee, and also feeds the Ober aarsee. It has a number of tributaries, including the Kander, which has just been join by the Simme. The Kander and Simme also feed into the Lütschine, the last of which feeds into the lake of Thun, which marks the head of navigation for the Aare. The Lütchine is also the source for the Lauteraarglet (Upper Aare) river. Digitalis purpurea is an herbaceous biennial or short-lived perennial plant. The leaves are spirally arranged, simple, long and broad, and are covered with gray-white pubescent and glandular hairs. The flowers are typically purple, but some plants, especially those under cultivation, may be pink, rose, yellow, or white. It is also naturalised in parts of North America and some other temperate regions. The plants are well known as the original source of the heart medicine digoxin (also called digitalis or digitalin) The main toxins in Digitalis spp. are the two chemically similar cardiac glycosides: digitoxin and digoxin. These toxins exert their effects by inhibiting the ATPase activity of a complex of transmembrane proteins that form the sodium potassium ATPase pump, (Na+/K+-ATPase) Digitalis poisoning includes a low pulse rate, nausea, vomiting, and uncoordinated contractions of different parts of the. heart, leading to cardiac arrest and finally death. The plant is popular as a garden subject, and numerous cultivars have been developed with a range of colours from white through pink to purple, such as ""Dalmatian Purple"". Cultivated forms often show flowers completely surrounding the central spike, in contrast to the wild form, where the flowers only appear on one side. The following selections have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Merit: Digitalis albapurea 4-9-9 (The Shirley Garden Society) and Digitalis grandiflora Mill. × Digitalis pur Purea L. (The Garden Society's award-winning Digitalis x fulva, Lindl. 1821) The three subspecies of Digitalispurpurea are: p. subsp. heywoodii – Iberia – most of Europe – p.subsp. mariana – Ieria – France – Portugal – Spain – Italy – Ireland – Greece – Portugal - Spain – Ireland - Portugal – France - Italy – Spain - Portugal - Ireland - Spain - France - USA - USA – USA - US - Canada - Canada. The fruit is a capsule which splits open at maturity to release the numerous tiny 0.1-0.2 mm seeds. It can be easily grown from seed or purchased as potted plants in the spring. The colours of the petals of the Digitalis purpurea are known to be determined by at least three genes that interact with each other. The M gene determined the production of a purple pigment, a type of antocianin. The m gene does not produce this pigment. The D gene is an enhances of the M gene, and leads it to produce a big amount of the pigment. Lastly, the W gene makes the pigment be deposited only in some spots, while the w gene allows the pigment to be spread all over the flower. The plant inspired a famous poem by the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli titled ""Digitale Purpurea"". It also inspired the Italian industrial metal band Digitalis Purpure a. It is one of several harvestable plants within the 2015 video game Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It's used for the production. of tranquilizer rounds by the Mother Base R&D team. The Rake's Progress is a series of eight paintings by 18th-century English artist William Hogarth. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison. The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display. The film Bedlam, directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rake’s Progress, produced by Bedlam Valton and directed by Rex Valton. The Stravinsky Opera received a writing credit for the 1951 opera. In 1961, David Hockney created his own edition of The Rakes Progress, based on Hogarth's paintings. The stage show ""The Rakes' Progress"" was created by the University of New Hampshire's Department of Dance and Dance, with a libretto by Wretto Kallman and Chester Auden and a score by Rex Whistler. It has been recorded in the repertoires of various ballet companies, several times several times, and remains in the repertoire of various film companies. It was also used for a stage production of The 17th century novel ""The Great Gatsby"" by William Makepeace Thackeray, which is based on the story of the fall of the Marquess of Marlowe, the Earl of Pembroke, and his son, William. The book was published in 1881. It remains a bestseller. Nine Elms is a district of London, situated in the far north-eastern corner of the London Borough of Wandsworth. The area was formerly mainly industrial but is now becoming more residential and commercial in character. It is dominated by Battersea Power Station, various railway lines and New Covent Garden Market. In October 2008 the U.S. Embassy in London announced that it would relocate to the area, moving from its current location in Grosvenor Square, Mayfair;  the new embassy is slated for completion in 2017. The Embassy of the Netherlands in London also announced in April 2013 that it was relocating to the region from Hyde Park Gate, Kensington. The Chinese Embassy is also rumoured to be relocating. In 2014, it was reported that Ballymore had engaged Lazard and CBRE Group to raise about €2.5bn to fund the Embassy Gardens development. Nick Webb: Mulryan is close to wiping the slate clean - Independent.ie, 1 September 2013 on regeneration of the area around Nine Elms Station, including shops, cafes, restaurants, office space and residential buildings.

The linear park will open up onto the Thames River Path at numerous points along the path, allowing access to the river’s edge and the beautiful views so rare in urban areas. Wandsworth council chose a design by Bystrup for a £40m pedestrian bridge between Nine Elms and Pimlico. The proposed extension would branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elm's and Battersea - creating two new stations. The station structure itself is expected to be repaired and secure by 2016, with completion of the whole project by 2020. The greatest officially recorded number of children born to one mother is 69 to the wife of Feodor Vassilyev, a peasant from Shuya, Russia, who gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven of sets of twins and two sets of triplets. In 27c1782, a Russian peasant named Shuya gave birth. to seven sets of twin girls, all of whom were born to identical twin girls. The world record for the most prolific mother ever is 69, born to Shuya and Michael West from Salford, Greater Manchester, in 17c1781. The most prolific single mother ever was born to a Russian woman named Nadezhda Kuznetsova, who had three children in a row in the 1950s and 1960s. She died in 2012. The number of babies born to Russian women in the last three years is now more than 10,000. The average age of a baby is now just over 30 years old, making it the youngest baby born in the UK since the 1970s. The oldest baby born to an American woman in the U.S. in the 1990s is just over three years old. The youngest baby was born in 1998 to a British woman, who is now in her 60s. In the 1990 and 2000s, the UK had the highest number of births to American mothers in the world, with more than 1,000 a year. The case was reported to Moscow by the Monastery of Nikolsk on 27 Feb 1782, which had recorded every birth. Only two of the children who were born in the period c. 1725–65 failed to survive their infancy. It is certainly conceivable that Mrs Vassilyev could have had a genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate (release multiple eggs in one cycle), which significantly increases the chance of having twins or multiple children.

The number of times a woman has given birth to twins, triplets, quadruplets and quadruplets in her fertile years. The total number of babies born to a woman in a single year is estimated to be more than 100,000. The largest number ever recorded to be born to two women in one year is more than 80,000, which was recorded in the 1970s and 1980s. The world record for the most children in one woman's fertile years is 76. Uraninite is a major ore of uranium.

"Passage:
Fontanelle
A fontanelle (or fontanel) (colloquially, soft spot) is an anatomical feature of the infant human skull comprising any of the soft membranous gaps (sutures) between the cranial bones that make up the calvaria of a fetus or an infant. Fontanelles allow for rapid stretching and deformation of the neurocranium as the brain expands faster than the surrounding bone can grow. Premature complete ossification of the sutures is called craniosynostosis.

During infancy, the anterior fontanelle is known as the bregma.

Structure

The skull of a newborn consists of five main bones: two frontal bones, two parietal bones, and one occipital bone. These are joined by fibrous sutures, which allow movement that facilitates childbirth and brain growth.

* Posterior fontanelle is triangle-shaped. It lies at the junction between the sagittal suture and lambdoid suture. At birth, the skull features a small posterior fontanelle with an open area covered by a tough membrane, where the two parietal bones adjoin the occipital bone (at the lambda). The posterior fontanelles ossify within 2 or 3 months of birth. This is called intramembranous ossification.  The mesenchymal connective tissue turns into bone tissue.
* Anterior fontanelle is a diamond-shaped membrane-filled space located between the two frontal and two parietal bones of the developing fetal skull. It persists until approximately 18 months after birth. It is at the junction of the coronal suture and sagittal suture. The fetal anterior fontanelle may be palpated until 18 months. In cleidocranial dysostosis, however, it is often late in closing or may never close.  Examination of an infant includes palpating the anterior fontanelle.
* Two smaller fontanelles are located on each side of the head, more anteriorly the sphenoidal or anterolateral fontanelle (between the sphenoid, parietal, temporal, and frontal bones) and more posteriorly the mastoid or posterolateral fontanelle (between the temporal, occipital, and parietal bones).
During birth, fontanelles enable the bony plates of the skull to flex, allowing the child's head to pass through the birth canal. The ossification of the bones of the skull causes the anterior fontanelle to close over by 9 to 18 months.  The sphenoidal and posterior fontanelles close during the first few months of life. The closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium. Other than the anterior and posterior fontanelles, the mastoid fontanelle and the sphenoidal fontanelle are also significant.

Closure

In humans, the sequence of fontanelle closure is as follows:
# The posterior fontanelle generally closes 8–12 weeks after birth;
# The sphenoidal fontanelle is the next to close around 6 months after birth;
# The mastoid fontanelle closes next from 6 to 18 months after birth; and
# The anterior fontanelle is generally the last to close between 12–18 months.

Clinical significance

The fontanelle may pulsate, and although the precise cause of this is not known, it is perfectly normal and seems to echo the heartbeat, perhaps via the arterial pulse within the brain vasculature, or in the meninges. This pulsating action is how the soft spot got its name – fontanelle is borrowed from the old French word fontenele, which is a diminutive of fontaine, meaning ""spring"". It is assumed that the term spring is used because of the analogy of the dent in a rock or earth where a spring arises. 

Parents may worry that their infant may be more prone to injury at the fontanelles. In fact, although they may colloquially be called ""soft-spots"", the membrane covering the fontanelles is extremely tough and difficult to penetrate.

Fontanelles allow the infant brain to be imaged using ultrasonography. Once they are closed, most of the brain is inaccessible to ultrasound imaging, because the bony skull presents an acoustic barrier.

Disease

Fontanelles – bulging

A very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised intracranial pressure. Increased cranial pressure in infants may cause the fontanelles to bulge or the head to begin to enlarge abnormally.  It can occur due to:
* Encephalitis – swelling (inflammation) of the brain, most often due to infections
* Hydrocephalus – a buildup of fluid inside the skull
* Meningitis—infection of the membranes covering the brain

Fontanelles – sunken

A sunken (also called ""depressed"") fontanelle indicates dehydration or malnutrition. 

Fontanelles – enlarged

The fontanelles may be enlarged, may be slow to close or may never close most commonly due to causes like: 
* Down syndrome
* Hydrocephalus
* Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
* Premature birth

Rarer causes include:
* Achondroplasia
* Apert syndrome
* Cleidocranial dysostosis
* Congenital rubella
* Neonatal hypothyroidism
* Osteogenesis imperfecta
* Rickets

In other animals

In apes the fontanelles fuse soon after birth. In chimpanzees the anterior fontanelle is fully closed by 3 months of age.

In dogs

Not all open fontanelles are connected with hydrocephalus. In many young dogs the skull bones are not fused at birth, but instead will close slowly over a three- to six-month period. Occasionally these bones fail to close, but the dog is still healthy. In these cases, however, the dog's owners need to be very careful, since any injury or bumps to the animal's head could cause significant brain damage, as well as conditions like epilepsy.

Ride of the Valkyries
The ""Ride of the Valkyries"" () is the popular term for the beginning of act 3 of Die Walküre, the second of the four operas by Richard Wagner that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen.

As a separate piece, the ""Ride"" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the ""Bridal Chorus"" from Lohengrin, the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" is one of Wagner's best-known pieces.

Context 

In the Walküre opera, the ""Ride"", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Brünnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner's Ring cycle.

Performance history 

The complete opera Die Walküre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer's intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the ""Ride"" to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered ""an utter indiscretion"" and forbade ""any such thing"".  However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner subsequently wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott.  In the period up to the first performance of the complete Ring cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting ""Unsavoury letters arrive for R. – requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don't know what else.""  Once the Ring had been given in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore. 

Outside opera 

In film 

Uses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915),  and What's Opera, Doc? (1957). 

The ""Ride"" is also associated with Apocalypse Now (1979),  where the 1/9 Air Cavalry regiment plays the piece of music on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Vietnamese village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops. 

In military 

The ""Ride"" is the regimental quick march of the British Parachute Regiment. 

In music 

Within the concert repertoire, the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" remains a popular encore, especially when other Wagnerian extracts feature in the scheduled program. For example, at the BBC Proms it was performed as such by Klaus Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 6 August 1992  and also by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Orchestra on 28 August 2001. 

Discography 

Apart from where the ""Ride"" is included in the recordings of the Walküre opera, it is a very popular piece, included in various popular classics anthologies. For instance in Deutsche Grammophon's 1991 Classicmania two CD album (von Karajan version), and in Brilliant Classics' 2011 Best Film Classics CD box, there included in the fifth CD, Opera at the Movies, with a reference to Apocalypse Now on the sleeve.

Note: Links with green  underlines are shopping links and will open in a new window
How To Measure Horse Height
It's easy to measure you horse's height accurately.
To determine how tall a horse is measure the horse, in inches, from  the ground in a straight line up to the highest point of the withers.  This is illustrated in the photo below by the yellow line.
Above: The height of a horse is properly measured, in inches,  from the ground to the highest point of the withers.
For the most accurate measurement the horse should be on firm, level  ground with its front feet even, or close to even.
Calculating The Results
After you have measured your horse you will need to  convert the results from inches to ""hands."" Horse height is correctly referred  to by a unit of measurement  known as a ""hand."" One hand is equal to four inches.
The gray mare in the photo above is 58 inches from the ground  to the top of her withers. When 58 is divided by 4, you have 14.5. The 14 is the  number of hands, and the .5 means another half of a hand, or another 2 inches. This means  she is 14 and one-half hands tall.
Correctly Writing And Speaking The Results
The correct way of writing ""14 and one-half hands"" is to write ""14.2"". It is not correct to write it as ""14.5"". When  correctly written, the number before the period is the  number of hands, and the number after the period is the remaining number of   inches. The number after the period should NOT stand for a fraction. Horseman  usually say a measurement like this one out loud as ""fourteen two"" or ""fourteen  and a half.""
A Few Examples
Below are a few examples of how to correctly   write down a horse's height. Remember, the number in front of the period is for  hands and the number after the period is the remaining inches.
15 - This is a correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands tall
15.0 - Another correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands tall
15.1 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 1  inch tall
15.2 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 2  inches tall
15.3 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 3  inches tall
15.4 - Wrong! This means that a horse is 15 hands, 4 inches tall. Since  a hand is equal to four inches, this horse is actually 16 hands tall.
15.5 - Wrong again! Some people incorrectly use the number after the  period to stand for fractions of a hand, but it should stand for inches. So,  some people write ""15.5"" to mean 15 and a half hands, but this should  correctly be written as ""15.2"".
If you like, you can add ""hh"" to a measurement, as in ""15.1hh"".  The ""hh"" stands for ""hands high.""
Horse Measuring Devices
There are measuring devices on the market for horses  that have hand and inches measurements marked on them. Some devices are rigid  poles with short cross bars toward the top that can be raised or lowered to rest on a  horse's withers. These are very handy and give accurate measurements easily.
Another common device is a horse height/weight tape , which is a special tape measure  with hands and inches marked on it. These are inexpensive and are accurate if the person doing the measuring  makes sure to run the tape straight up  and down, and to read the measurement at a level angle.
Where Did ""Hands"" Come From?
As stated above, a horse's height is measured in  hands. The origin of measuring a horse this way is very old, but easy to  understand. In days long ago people did not have the common measuring devices  (like tape measures, etc.) that we do today. To measure a horse, they used what  was handy (no pun intended): Their hands. At various times in history and in  different locales a ""hand"" was defined as the with of a person's hand  using the fingers only, the width of a person's hand using the fingers and the thumb, the  height of a clenched fist, and possibly others. Somewhere along the way, the  measuring unit of a hand was standardized to mean four inches. Though the  origins are ancient, a hand is still the unit of measurement for horses that  modern horse owners use today.
Question:
Horses are measured in 'hands', what is the equivalent of a hand in inches?
Answer:
four  distance
Passage:
Private Walker
Private Joe Walker is a fictional black market spiv (or Wholesales Supplier, as he politely puts it) and Home Guard platoon member portrayed by actor James Beck on the BBC television sitcom Dad's Army. James Beck died suddenly in 1973, and is featured in just under three-quarters of the episodes. Despite this, the character of Walker was possibly one of the most prominent and popular in the show. Following his character's departure (Walker was last mentioned in the episode ""The Recruit"", although he does not appear in this episode) the series attempted to replace him with a war reporter called Private Cheeseman (played by Talfryn Thomas) who had made a previous cameo appearance in My British Buddy.

Personality

Walker was the second youngest member of the platoon, the youngest being Pike. A pleasant and amiable (if slightly shifty) personality, Walker is nevertheless a constant thorn in Mainwaring's side as he doesn't share his idealism and makes cheeky and witty interruptions during his serious lectures. However, despite this he is good-natured and loyal to his commanding officer and platoon comrades, and is a valuable asset to the platoon, due to his many ""business"" connections and his ability to mysteriously conjure up almost anything that is rationed or no longer in the shops due to the War - and he will also have it in vast supply (for a price). 

Private Walker also demonstrates keen improvisational skills and cunning; as a result, owing to these attributes and his cheerful willingness to use tactics that Mainwaring might not consider to be 'cricket', he is usually responsible for getting the platoon out of many of the scrapes that they find themselves in. He is constantly on the lookout for opportunities to make a few bob, and can normally be found trying to sell such things as petrol coupons and black market foodstuffs to his platoon comrades, usually at high prices and from dubious sources. His ""business"" activities are not limited to just the members of the platoon, or indeed even to the residents of Walmington-on-Sea, as he has often made reference to acquiring ""essential supplies"" for members of the rival Eastgate platoon and various influential people, military or civilian; at one point, he offers to provide ""a couple of bottles of scotch"" to a high-ranking GHQ officer, when Mainwaring briefly loses his command of the platoon. Indeed, the only time Walker can't find a buyer for his ""essential supplies"" is when the American Army arrives at Walmington-on-Sea (with the comparatively well-off American troops already having plenty of liquor and other items normally provided by Walker).

Walker considers himself a ladies' man, and his recurring girlfriend Shirley (played by Wendy Richard) is seen in several episodes. In the platoon, he mostly associates with Jones, Pike and Frazer. Despite merely being a Private, Walker clearly has some form of influence over the platoon, not least due to his black-market dealings which have got them out of (and into) numerous scrapes. Moreover, when Frazer is temporarily promoted to Captain in If the Cap Fits..., he selects Walker as his Sergeant. Walker has friendly relationships with all the men in the platoon, jokingly referring to the Scottish Frazer as ""Taffy"", and occasionally calling Jones a ""silly old duffer"" when they have the odd disagreement.

He is supposedly allergic to corned beef, and this is given as the reason why he has not been called up for the regular army, although it is generally assumed that he has found a way to dodge the rules. This allergy was exposed in the episode The Loneliness of the Long Distance Walker, which has since been lost from the BBC's archives. He was conscripted, only to be discharged when it was found that corned beef fritters were the only rations left for the soldiers to eat.  Although a superficially implausible explanation for Walker's discharge it is actually possible to have an [http://www.livestrong.com/article/525254-corned-beef-allergy/ allergy to certain types of corned beef] but not beef itself as a result of various antioxidants that may be used in the curing process.

Walker's final appearance was in the episode Things That Go Bump in the Night, where the platoon spent the night in a mysterious house. In fact he is only seen in the location shots, filmed some time before the studio recording. Beck was ill for the recordings of both this episode and the next, The Recruit, in which the story suggested that Walker had ""gone to the smoke"" (a slang term for London) to ""do a deal"". After Beck's death, Walker was never mentioned in the show (though the character survived the war; the very first episode begins with a scene set in 1968, as Mainwaring, now an alderman, launches his ""I'm Backing Britain"" campaign - Walker is seen as one of the town worthies present at the launch).
 
In the radio adaptations of the series, Graham Stark stood in until Larry Martyn gave his portrayal of Walker for subsequent shows. In 1976 John Bardon played Walker in the stage production. Scriptwriter Jimmy Perry originally intended to play the part himself, but was advised against it by his co-writer David Croft. Walker was based on a spiv character created and performed by British comedian and actor Arthur English (English was in the controversial episode Absent Friends and starred in Are You Being Served?).

Jimmy Beck
Passage:
Jenny Pitman
Jenny Pitman (born 11 June 1946ISBN 1-85225-254-5 ""Jenny Pitman, The Autobiography"" ) is a former British racehorse trainer and author. She became the first woman to train a Grand National winner, when Corbiere won the race in 1983. She went on to win a second Grand National with Royal Athlete in 1995. Following her retirement from horse training in 1998 she became a writer of novels, principally with a racing theme.

Childhood

Pitman was born as Jenny Harvey on her family's farm near Hoby, Leicestershire, one of seven children. She was brought up assisting in manual farm work, where horse powered equipment was a novelty, and learned to ride a pony ""so young that being on horseback seemed as natural as walking"". In 1957 she left the Hoby village school to attend Sarson Secondary Modern Girls' School in Melton Mowbray. She sustained a fractured skull when a showjumping pole fell on her head during a gymkhana at Syston, it was many months before resultant convulsions were diagnosed. At the age of 14, she obtained a weekend and school holiday job at Brooksby Grange horse racing yard.

Pitman left school two weeks before her 15th birthday, taking up a position as a stable girl, at Brooksby Grange for a weekly wage of £3 4s 5d. Her first overnight stop was at Manchester where her filly, Star Princess, won the 1962 Diomedes Handicap. Two years later she changed jobs, moving to a stable in Bishop's Cleeve, Gloucestershire, the first time she had lived away from her Leicestershire home.

Adult life

Pitman worked at Bishop's Cleeve for two years. One day there, she was returning from a workout on the local gallops when her horse was spooked by a cyclist travelling around a corner too fast and on the wrong side of the road. The cyclist in question was jockey Richard Pitman. Jenny's initial reaction to Richard was unfavourable, but later, when Richard obtained a job in Lambourn at Fred Winter's training stables 50 mi from Bishop's Cleeve, Jenny was persuaded to apply for a job in Lambourn with Major Champneys at Church Farm Stables. She moved in 1964.

Aged 19, she married Richard Pitman. In August 1966, their son Mark Pitman was born and Jenny became a full-time housewife. Son Paul was born in October 1967. In the next winter, missing the world of horses, they bought a 6 acre property with stables and an indoor school in Hinton Parva to provide a service to other trainers for recuperating injured horses. In 'Parva Stud', the family struggled to live in an unheated caravan. By the end of 1968 Pitman had 8 horses at the yard. With Richard's second place prize from the 1969 Grand National, the Pitmans were able to commission a bungalow on the premises to escape the poor condition caravan. In 1969 she employed a 'lad' to assist at the yard, Melvyn Saddler, who became her right-hand man as her success grew.

In February 1974, Pitman was able to enter a horse she had trained in her first point-to-point race. Ridden by stable lad Bryan Smart, Road Race didn't figure in the race betting, but amazingly managed to pass the favourite after the last fence to win.

In 1977 Jenny and Richard divorced and Jenny left Wiltshire and moved to Lambourn, Berkshire. She is now married to businessman, David Stait. In 1975 she was successful in getting her first horse training licence and her first winner came in the very same year.

In 1983 she became the first woman to train a Grand National winner, when Corbiere was the victor.  She was to win one other Grand National with Royal Athlete in 1995 although her horse Esha Ness was first past the post in the void National of 1993. 
 
In 1998 she was awarded the OBE for services to horseracing  and subsequently retired from training racehorses in 1999, handing over the reins to son, Mark. Pitman was the first winner of the Helen Rollason award at the BBC Sports Personality Of The Year Awards.

Although still seen at the races, she is now a prolific writer of novels, principally with a racing spin. 

A survivor of thyroid cancer, she is a patron of the British Thyroid Foundation.
Question:
Jenny Pitman was the trainer of which 1995 Grand National winning horse?
Answer:
Royal Athlete

Dunkery Hill
Dunkery Beacon at the summit of Dunkery Hill is the highest point on Exmoor and in Somerset, England. It is also the highest point in southern England outside of Dartmoor.

The sandstone hill rises to 1705 ft and provides views over the surrounding moorland, the Bristol Channel and hills up to 86 mi away. The site has been visited by humans since the Bronze Age, and contains several burial mounds in the form of cairns and bowl barrows. Sweetworthy on the lower slopes is the site of two Iron Age hill forts or enclosures and a deserted medieval settlement. The hill is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest and National nature reserve. It was in private ownership until the 20th century, when it was donated to the National Trust by Sir Thomas Acland, Colonel Wiggin and Allan Hughes; a stone cairn was erected at the summit to commemorate the event.

Location

Dunkery is composed of Middle Devonian sedimentary rock, () known as the Hangman Sandstone Formation.  This supports acidic soils. 
The ridge along the top of the hill is  long.

At 1705 ft ordnance datum (OD), the mean height above sea level,  Dunkery Beacon is the highest natural point in Somerset,  although the tip of the Mendip TV Mast is higher at  OD. Dunkery is ranked 23rd in the UK in terms of dominance and is a Marilyn, meaning that it is a peak with 150 m or more of relative height. The nearest higher hill is Yes Tor, 37 mi away. John Fry, a character in R. D. Blackmore's 1869 novel Lorna Doone, calls it the ""haighest place of Hexmoor"". 

Dunkery lies just 4 mi from the Bristol Channel at Porlock. The shortest route of ascent goes from the car park at Dunkery Gate, and is just  long. There are extensive views from the summit, from where the Bristol and English Channel coasts, the Brecon Beacons including Pen Y Fan, Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor, the Severn Bridges and Cleeve Hill 86 mi away in Gloucestershire are visible. 

History

Dunkery Hill was part of the ""Royal Forest of Exmoor"", established by Henry II according to the late 13th-century Hundred Rolls. There has been some debate about the origin of the name ""Dunkery"" and its predecessors ""Duncrey"" and ""Dunnecray"".  Eilert Ekwall suggests that it comes from the Welsh din meaning hillfort and creic or creag meaning rock.  

There are several Bronze Age burial mounds at or near the summit.  Two of the largest are Joaney How and Robin How, which have been damaged over many years, although plans have been made to restore and protect them.  ""How"" comes from the Norse for burial mound.  Joaney How on the northern slope, is more than 22 m in diameter.   On the southeastern slopes are four more cairns,  and there are a further two round cairns 390 m and 420 m southeast of Rex Stile Head.  In addition to the cairns are barrows, which also date from the Bronze Age. One bowl barrow on the southeastern spur of the Chains is  in diameter.  A circular funerary stone mound 850 m north of Dunkery Bridge, which is a  walk from the summit, dates from the Neolithic or Bronze Age. It is approximately  high and 14 m in diameter.  

Sweetworthy, on Dunkery Hill's north-facing slope, is the site of two Iron Age hill forts or enclosures;   one has a single rampart and external ditch, enclosing .  The rampart is still visible, and the ditch on the east side is used as a trackway.   There was a defended settlement above the main site.  It is also the site of a deserted medieval settlement, which has been designated an ancient monument.   It has been added to the Heritage at Risk register because of the vulnerability to plant growth. 

In 1918 Sir Thomas Acland leased part of the land.along with a large part of the Holnicote Estate, for 500 years. Dunkery Hill was put up for sale in 1928. Labour Party activist and Member of Parliament Margaret Bondfield asked in the House of Commons if the government was willing to have it designated an ancient monument, to preserve it for future generations. She received the reply that although the government was agreeable to having the hill listed there were no funds available for its purchase;  the beacon and surrounding mounds were subsequently designated an ancient monument.  The beacon itself, and 960 acre of surrounding land, was donated in 1932 by Colonel W.W. Wiggin. A further 945 acre of nearby land was donated in 1934 by Mrs Hughes in memory of her husband Alan Hughes of Lynch Allerford, Minehead. The donations were commemorated in 1935 with an event when a plaque was attached to the summit memorial cairn. Further parts of the Holnicote Estate, which includes other land donated by the Acland family and others, was given in subsequent years.   

Ecology

The site is part of the North Exmoor Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), part of the Dunkery & Horner Woods National Nature Reserve  and part of the Exmoor Coastal Heaths Special Area of Conservation. 

The hill is blanketed in heather, which gives it a deep purple colour during the summer. Ling and bell heather, gorse, sessile oak, ash, rowan, hazel, bracken, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns all grow on the hill or in surrounding woodland, as well as some unique whitebeam species. Exmoor ponies, red deer, pied flycatchers, wood warblers, lesser spotted woodpeckers, redstarts, dippers, snipe, skylarks and kestrels are some of the fauna to be found on or around the hill and in nearby Horner Woods, home to 14 of the 16 UK bat species and including barbastelle and Bechstein's bats.

Licence to Kill (soundtrack)
The soundtrack to Licence to Kill, the 16th James Bond film of the same name, was released by MCA Records in 1989.

Because the usual James Bond composer John Barry (who had scored almost every film from From Russia with Love onwards) was not available at the time as he was undergoing throat surgery, the soundtrack's more upbeat and suspenseful score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen.

Initially Eric Clapton and Vic Flick were asked to write and perform the theme song to Licence to Kill. The theme was said to have been a new version based on the James Bond Theme. The guitar riff heard in the original recording of the theme was played by Flick. 

The prospect, however, fell apart and Gladys Knight's song and performance was chosen, later becoming a Top 10 hit in the United Kingdom. The song was composed by Narada Michael Walden, Jeffrey Cohen and Walter Afanasieff, based on the ""horn line"" from Goldfinger, which required royalty payments to the original writers.  At five-minutes twelve seconds it is the longest Bond theme. The music video of ""Licence to Kill"" was directed by Daniel Kleinman, who later took over the reins of title designer from Maurice Binder for the 1995 Bond film, GoldenEye.

All the instrumental tracks are amalgams of various sequences and musical cues from the film rather than straight score excerpts. The end credits of the film feature the song ""If You Asked Me To"" sung by Patti LaBelle. Though the song was a top ten R&B charter and a minor pop hit for LaBelle, in 1992, the song was covered by and became a much bigger hit for singer Céline Dion. The track ""Wedding Party"", used during the wedding of Felix Leiter to Della Churchill, makes reference to the track ""Jump Up"" from the first Bond film, Dr. No.

Monet • Paintings • Houses of Parliament
Houses of Parliament
Claude Monet first went to London in 1870 to escape the Franco-Prussian War. While there he would have seen and been inspired by painters like Turner and began to develop his use of bright colors that would become a defining element of Impressionist painting.
After traveling and moving to Giverny, where he would have his famous gardens, Monet returned to London in 1899 and began work on a series of paintings depicting the Palace of Westminster, also called The House of Parliament, or simply Parliament. His Houses of Parliament series contains 19 canvases all exactly the same size and depicting the same scene from the same vantage point.
Starting in February 1900, Monet began painting a view of Parliament from across the river Thames. From a terrace on the second floor of the St. Thomas Hospital, Monet could see the Houses of Parliament, including Big Ben, sitting on the edge of the river. In each canvas Parliament is on the right, with water to the left and in front and sky above. As in previous works, these paintings are studies in showing the changing landscape. Because his subject, the light, changes so quickly Monet would sketch out the
building of Parliament before hand and then paint, adding the color and detail, while looking out his terrace over the river.
In previous Series paintings, Haystacks and Rouen Cathedral , Monet showed the effect light and the atmosphere has on objects. While the Parliament series has the building, Westminster Palace is so distorted and obscured by the fog and smog it becomes secondary as the subject. For the Parliament series, we are not just seeing the effect of light on objects we see, Monet is showing the effect of light on the atmosphere itself. Even today London is famous for its fog, and in the 1880’s the Fog was at its peak being heavy and frequent. By 1900, the fog had been decreasing, but was still apparent and being thickened by the smog a result of London’s growing industry.
Throughout the series of paintings Monet shows the river change from blue and green to bright orange and red lit by the afternoon sun. Monet’s brushstrokes create depth and layers within the fog showing the thickness and weight of the atmosphere. In one painting Parlement, coucher du soleil, 1902, the sun is setting behind the clouds creating highlights and shadows high within the sky turning the river into a mirror reflecting Westminster Palace. In another Houses of Parliament, stormy sky, 1904, almost the entire canvas is orange; as the storm, lit by the high sun, hangs over London darkening Parliament. A few of his canvases show the disc of the sun, visible through the fog and reflecting on the water, while others show a dark sky, the sun hidden behind a thick fog.
Monet made two trips to London to work on the Houses of Parliament series, in 1900 and 1901. While he painted them from the St. Thomas Hospital, he returned to France with canvases and worked on them for the next three years not showing them until 1904. It may be thought by some viewers that their apparent lack of detail and the years spent working on them by memory may result in a different scene than what he saw, but modern researchers have been able to analyze his works showing his accuracy. By tracing known astrological patterns and solar geometry, not only have scholars been able to pinpoint the exact room and terrace he was painting from, they know the precise times. In fact, his depictions are so accurate that some study them to determine the elements that made up the fog and smog, and changes in the climate by his use of color.

It is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner's Ring cycle. The piece is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. In military, it is the regimental quick march of the British Parachute Regiment.Uses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915) and What's Opera, Doc? (1957) It is also associated with Apocalypse Now (1979), where the 1/9 Air Cavalry regiment plays the piece of music on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Vietnamese village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops.

Horse height is correctly referred  to by a unit of measurement known as a ""hand"" One hand is equal to four inches. The origin of measuring a horse this way is very old, but easy to understand. To measure a horse, they used what  was handy (no pun intended): Their hands. Though the origins are ancient, a hand is still the measurement for horses that modern horse owners use today. The correct way of writing ""14 and one-half hands"" is to write ""14.2"". It is not correct to write it as "" 14.5"". Some people incorrectly use the number after the period to stand for fractions of a hand, but it should stand for inches. If you like, you can add ""hh"" to a measurement, as in ""15.1hh"".  The ""hhh"" stands for ""hands high"" or ""hands low"" If a horse is 15 hands tall, it is 15 and a half hands tall. This is 15.1 inches tall, or 15.2 inches tall. Since a horse's height is measured in hands, this horse is 16 hands tall and 15.5 feet tall. The number before the period is the number of hands, and the number afterwards is the remaining number of inches. Some people write ""15"" to mean 15 and  half hands, but this should  correctly be written as '15.2' The number in front of the  period is for hands and thenumber after the period is the number after the period for inches. This means that a horse is 15 hands, 4 inches tall and 15.4 inches tall. A horse is 15 hands, 1 inch tall. It is 15 inches tall and 15.0 inches tall. It is 15 hands and 1 inch tall. There are measuring devices on the market for horses  that have hand and inches measurements marked on them. These are inexpensive and are accurate if the person doing the measuring  makes sure to run the tape straight up  and down, and to read the measurement at a level angle. Some devices are rigid  poles with short cross bars toward the top that can be raised or lowered to rest on a  horse's withers. Another common device is a horse height/weight tape, which is a special tape measure  with hands and inches marked on it. It's just under three-quarters of a meter long. Walker was the second youngest member of the platoon, the youngest being Pike. A pleasant and amiable (if slightly shifty) personality, Walker is nevertheless a constant thorn in Mainwaring's side as he doesn't share his idealism. Good-natured and loyal to his commanding officer and platoon comrades, and is a valuable asset to the platoon. He is constantly on the lookout for opportunities to make a few bob, and can normally be found trying to sell such things as petrol coupons and black market foodstuffs to his platoon comrades. He considers himself a ladies' man, and his recurring girlfriend Shirley (played by Wendy Richard) is seen in several episodes. His final appearance was in the episode Things That Go Bump in the Night, where the platoon spent the night in a mysterious house. He was discharged when it was found that corned beef fritters were the only rations left for the soldiers to eat. Despite merely being a Private, Walker clearly has some form of influence over the platoon,. not least due to his black-market dealings which have got them out of (and into) numerous scrapes. He has often made reference to acquiring ""essential supplies"" for members of the rival Eastgate platoon and various influential people, military or civilian. At one point, he offers to provide ""a couple of bottles of scotch"" to a high-ranking GHQ officer, when he briefly loses his command of the platoons. He also jokingly refers to the Scottish Frazer as ""Taffy"", and occasionally calls Jones a ""silly old duffer"" when they have the odd disagreement. In the episode The Loneliness of the Long Distance Walker, which has since been lost from the BBC's archives, he was conscripted, only to be discharged when he was found to be allergic to corned Beef. Although a superficially implausible explanation for Walker's discharge it is actually possible to have an [http://www.livestrong.com/article/525254-corned-beef-allergy/ allergy to certain types of cored beef] but not beef itself as a result of various antioxidants that may be used in the curing process. Jenny Pitman is a former British racehorse trainer and author. She became the first woman to train a Grand National winner, when Corbiere won the race in 1983. She went on to win a second Grand National with Royal Athlete in 1995. Pitman left school two weeks before her 15th birthday, taking up a position as a stable girl, at Brooksby Grange for a weekly wage of £3 4s 5d. Her first overnight stop was at Manchester where her filly, Star Princess, won the 1962 Diomedes Handicap. She sustained a fractured skull when a showjumping pole fell on her head during a gymkhana at Syston, it was many months before resultant convulsions were diagnosed. At the age of 14, she obtained a weekend and school holiday job at Brooks by Grange horse racing yard. At 19, she married Richard Pitman. In August 1966, their son Mark Pitman was born and Jenny became a full-time housewife. In the next winter, missing the world of horses, they bought a 6 acre property with stables and an indoor school in Hinton Parva to provide a service to other trainers for recuperating injured horses. By 1968 Pitman had 8 horses at the yard, the family struggled to live in an unheated caravan. With Richard's second place prize from 1969, the Pitmans were able to commission the Grand National, the first time a woman had done so. In 1974, Pitman grew her right-hand man, Mel Saddler, who became her right hand man as her success grew. In 1998 she became a writer of novels, principally with a racing theme. She died in a car crash in 2009. She is survived by her husband, Mark, and their three children. She also has a son, Paul, and a daughter, Emma. She has written a book about her life, The Autobiography of Jenny Pitman, published by Biteback Press, £16.99 (hardback). She has also written a biography about her time as a horse trainer, The Horse Whisperer, £12.99. She was also the subject of a BBC Radio 4 documentary, The Horses of Jenny, about her experiences as a racehorse Trainer, in which she met and trained some of the world's best horses. Dunkery Hill is the highest point on Exmoor and in Somerset, England. The sandstone hill rises to 1705 ft and provides views over the surrounding moorland, the Bristol Channel and hills up to 86 mi away. The site has been visited by humans since the Bronze Age, and contains several burial mounds in the form of cairns and bowl barrows. Dunkery is ranked 23rd in the UK in terms of dominance and is a Marilyn, meaning that it is a peak with 150 m or more of relative height. There are extensive views from the summit, from where the Bristol and English Channel coasts, the Brecon Beacons including Pen Y Fan, Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor, the Severn Bridges and Cleeve Hill are visible. The shortest route of ascent goes from the car park at Dunkery Gate, and is just long. The hill is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest and National nature reserve. It was in private ownership until the 20th century, when it was donated to the National Trust by Sir Thomas Acland, Colonel Wiggin and Allan Hughes; a stone cairn was erected at the summit to commemorate the event. There has been some debate about the origin of the name ""Dunksery"" and its predecessors ""Duncrey"" and ""Dunnecray"".  Eilert Ekwall suggests that it comes from the Welsh dinfort and creag meaning creag or rock. Two of the largest Bronze Age burial mound are Joaney How, which have been damaged over many years, although plans have been made to restore and protect them. The largest is Joaney Robin How on the northern slope, which is more than 22 m in diameter, and there are more than four more on the southeastern slopes,  and there is a burial mound on the southern slope. The name comes from Norse ""How"" which means ""to protect"" or ""to look after"" and refers to a Norse burial mound in the area, which was called ""Howan"" by the Norse. The nearest higher hill is Yes Tor, 37 mi away, and the nearest lower hill is Sweetworthy on the lower slopes is the site of two Iron Age hill forts or enclosures and a deserted medieval settlement. A survivor of thyroid cancer, she is a patron of the British Thyroid Foundation. She is now a prolific writer of novels, principally with a racing spin. Dunkery Beacon is the highest point in the English National Park. The site is part of the North Exmoor Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is also the site of a deserted medieval settlement, which has been designated an ancient monument. The hill is blanketed in heather, which gives it a deep purple colour during the summer. Ling and bell he Heather, gorse, sessile oak, ash, rowan, hazel, bracken, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns all grow on the hill or in surrounding woodland, as well as some unique whitebeam species. Ex moor ponies, red deer, pied flycatchers, wood warblers, lesser spotted woodpeckers, redstarts, dippers, snipe, skylarks and kestrels are some of the fauna to be found on or around the hill and in nearby Horner Woods. The soundtrack to Licence to Kill, the 16th James Bond film of the same name, was released by MCA Records in 1989. The theme was said to have been a new version based on the James Bond Theme. The guitar riff heard in the original recording of the theme was played by Flick. The song later became a Top 10 hit in the United Kingdom. It was composed by Nar Walden, Jeffrey Cohen and Walter Afanasieff. The original writers required payments to the Goldfinger royalty to pay for the original theme. At five-minutes twelve seconds it is the longest Bond theme ever written, and the longest James Bond theme is at five minutes and twelve seconds. It has been added to the Heritage at Risk register because of the vulnerability to plant growth. It also has two round cairns 390 m and 420 m southeast of Rex Stile Head, which also date from the Bronze Age. One bowl barrow on the southeastern spur of the Chains is  in diameter. A circular funerary stone mound 850 m north of Dunkery Bridge, which is a  walk from the summit, dates from the Neolithic or Bronze Age, and is approximately  high and 14 m in diameter   Sweetworthy, on Dunkery Hill's north-facing slope, is theSite of two Iron Age hill forts or enclosures;   one has a single rampart and external ditch, enclosing.  The rampart is still visible, and  the ditch on the east side is used as a trackway. The end credits of the film feature the song ""If You Asked Me To"" sung by Patti LaBelle. The track ""Wedding Party"", used during the wedding of Felix Leiter to Della Churchill, makes reference to the track ""Jump Up"" from the first Bond film, Dr. No. The Houses of Parliament series contains 19 canvases all exactly the same size and depicting the same scene from the same vantage point. In each canvas Parliament is on the right, with water to the left and in front and sky above. As in previous works, these paintings are studies in showing the changing landscape. In one painting Parlement, coucher du soleil, 1902, the sun is setting behind the clouds creating highlights and shadows high within the sky turning the river into a mirror reflecting Westminster. A few of the canvases show the water and fog and reflecting on the disc of the sun, visible through the fog and on the sun. Even today London is famous for its fog, and in the 1880’s the Fog was at its peak being heavy and frequent. By 1900, the fog had been decreasing, but was still apparent and being thickened by the smog a result of London's growing industry. While the Parliament series has the building, Westminster Palace is so distorted and obscured by the fog it becomes secondary as the subject. In another Houses of parliament, stormy sky, 1904, almost the entire entire canvas is a storm, lit by the high sun, hangs over London Parliament. The painting shows the river change from blue and green to bright orange and redlit by the afternoon sun. In the series of paintings Monet showed the effect light and the atmosphere has on objects. In previous Series paintings, Haystacks and Rouen Cathedral, Monet showing the effect of light and. the atmosphere on objects, we are not just seeing the effect on objects we see, Monet is showing the effects of light on the atmosphere itself. For more information, visit the Monet Gallery at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. For information on how to buy a copy of the book, go to: http://www.museumofmodernart.org/book/Houses-of-Parliament-Volume-1.html. Monet made two trips to London to work on the Houses of Parliament series, in 1900 and 1901. While he painted them from the St. Thomas Hospital, he returned to France with canvases and worked on them for the next three years not showing them until 1904. Modern researchers have been able to analyze his works showing his accuracy. By tracing known astrological patterns and solar geometry, they know the exact room and terrace he was painting from. In fact, his depictions are so accurate that some study them to determine the elements that made up the fog and smog, and changes in the climate."

The Master's Welcome
""Hard to imagine it done better. A site and campus to dream about. A school with mind, heart, guts and a constant fizz.""
Good Schools Guide 2016
When you make your first visit to Wellington College you immediately get a sense that it is more than just a school. The beautiful grounds and breath-taking buildings see to that, as does the palpable sense of purpose among every pupil and member of staff you meet. I genuinely do not believe that there is a better coeducational boarding and day school for 13 – 18 year olds in the land.
The College, founded in 1853 as a living memorial to the Duke of Wellington, sought to deliver an inspirational education for all of its pupils. As the school grew, so too did the identity of those pupils. It is an identity built on intellectual curiosity, on true independence, on a generous and far-reaching inclusivity and on the courage to be properly and unselfishly individual. It is, in short, the capacity to be inspired to become the very best you can be. And it is these qualities that are present in the thousands of small interactions that happen all the time here, the little daily miracles that make this such a special place. After all, the school we build is the school we build together, and every pupil who passes through Wellington leaves an indelible mark on our community. It is my absolute responsibility to help all our pupils become the very best that they can be, and to develop the identity that marks them out as a true Wellingtonian.
Wellington College is set in 400 acres of beautiful parkland in leafy Berkshire, one hour from Central London and just 40 minutes from Heathrow. Please do explore our on-line tour to get a sense of the scope and size of the school, for our campus is quite simply stunning. Wellington’s curriculum is vibrant, demanding and progressive, and with our ground-breaking Wellbeing course and classes in Philosophy and Thinking, Wellington has become nationally renowned as a centre for curriculum development. Our stunning examination results and university outcomes speak for themselves.
Creativity flourishes and it was no surprise when the Arts Council awarded us Artsmark Gold in recognition of the outstanding provision and standards across all the Arts at the school. We have a “premier league” reputation as one of the best schools for sport in the UK and, in recent years, our teams have achieved national renown and titles in hockey, rugby, golf, shooting, triathlon, squash, equestrianism, cricket, rackets and polo. Outward-facing in all that we do, the College’s focus on service, leadership and character education means that Wellingtonians leave the school fully prepared for the challenges of adult life in the 21st Century.
RT @WillGreenwood: Mia!!! Awesomeness!!! http://EPg3ox7z9g
@Welly_Master | 18 January 2017
Choice lies at the heart of our co-curriculum and is central to developing the Wellington Identity which ensures that all our pupils are Inspired, Intellectual, Independent, Individual and Inclusive. Our pupils and our staff see every day as an opportunity, a chance to grow and a chance to learn and the journey as a life-long learner begins the moment a child starts at Wellington.
Will you let your child join us on that journey? It could be the most inspired choice you ever make.

Kevin Lloyd
Kevin Reardon Lloyd (28 March 1949 – 2 May 1998) was an English actor, best known for portraying DC Alfred ""Tosh"" Lines in Thames Television's The Bill.

Born in Derby, Lloyd trained at East 15 Acting School in Loughton, Essex. Prior to appearing in The Bill he had already played the high-profile role of nightclub owner, Don Watkins, in the soap opera Coronation Street. He also made appearances in a number of other TV shows, including the first series of Starting Out, Boon, Minder, Dear John, Farrington of the F.O., Dempsey and Makepeace, Z-Cars, Andy Capp, Auf Wiedersehen Pet, Blake's 7 and Casualty. His film credits included roles in Trial by Combat (1976), Britannia Hospital (1982), Don't Open till Christmas (1984) and Link (1986).

Lloyd was one of the most popular members of the television show, The Bill. In 1996, the show won the award for ""Best TV Drama"" at the National Television Awards and it was Lloyd who collected it on behalf of the cast and crew. His Welsh-born father, Ellis Aled Lloyd, was himself a police officer who was killed in an accident while answering an emergency call aged 46 in 1970. 

A chronic alcoholic, he played ""Tosh"" continuously from 1988 until he was sacked from The Bill in 1998 for his lack of punctuality and failing to learn his lines. Within days, he was admitted to a clinic in Burton upon Trent for detoxification and was administered Antabuse (Disulfiram), but then left the premises to drink alcohol. He returned to the clinic in an intoxicated state, retired to bed, fell asleep, then choked on his vomit. Lloyd died just one week after recording his last scenes for The Bill, and the character of Tosh was still appearing on screen for more than a month after Lloyd's death.

He had been so popular on The Bill that on 26 February 1992, within four years of joining the show, he was selected as special guest for the TV guest show This Is Your Life. 

He was the brother of ITN reporter Terry Lloyd who was killed in the Iraq War in 2003.   His son, James Lloyd, is an actor who also appeared on The Bill between 2004 and 2006.

Passage:
The Bartender and the Thief
""The Bartender and the Thief"" is a 1998 single by Welsh rock band Stereophonics. It was the first single taken from their second album Performance and Cocktails. It was released on 9 November 1998 and reached #3 in the UK charts.

The song is the second track on the Performance and Cocktails album. A live version from Cardiff Castle is available on CD2 of the single. Another live version from Sheffield Arena is on the ""Moviestar"" single. A bar version of the song is on CD 1 of the ""I Wouldn't Believe Your Radio"" single.

The music video features the band playing at Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand and is based on the Francis Ford Coppola movie, Apocalypse Now.

The song, which is one of their heavier tracks, is frequently played amongst their live sets. During live performances, vocalist Kelly Jones has been known to utilise the two bars without vocals before the final chorus to reference the Motörhead song ""Ace of Spades"". The lyrics therefore are ""The ace of spades, the ace of spades. The bartender and the thief were lovers...""

Strangely, the song's full length intro only featured on the CD1 single (and in the music video), but was edited off the Performance & Cocktails album.

Welsh PDC Darts player Mark Webster uses this track as his entrance music. An instrumental version of the song is featured in the European version of the PlayStation racing game Gran Turismo 2.

Passage:
Don’t spoil the ship for a ha’p’orth of tar. | word histories
Don’t spoil the ship for a ha’p’orth of tar.  |  word histories
Don’t spoil the ship for a ha’p’orth of tar.
MEANING
 
Don’t risk the failure of a large project by trying to economise on trivial things.
 
ORIGIN
 
Ship is a dialectal pronunciation of sheep, and this proverb was originally to lose the sheep (often the hog) for a halfpennyworth of tar, that is to say, for want of spending a trivial sum on tar, the allusion being to the use of tar either in marking sheep or to protect sores and wounds on sheep from flies (the expression tarred with the same brush also originally alluded to the use of tar by shepherds).
In The Countryman’s Instructor (1636), John Crawshey, who described himself as a “plaine Yorkshire man”, wrote:
To conclude with the old proverbe, hee that will loose a sheepe (or a hogge) for a pennyworth of tarre, cannot deserve the name of a good husband [= farmer]: you may guesse at my meaning.
The noun hog was used to denote a young sheep from the time it is weaned until its first shearing (it was also applied to any of various other farm animals of a year old). In A Collection of English Words not generally used, with their Significations and Original, in two Alphabetical Catalogues, the one of such as are proper to the Northern, the other to the Southern Counties (1691), John Ray (1627-1705) recorded, in North Country Words:
A Hog; a Sheep of a year old; used also in Northampton and Leicester shires, where they also call it a Hoggrel.
And, in South and East Country Words, he wrote:
Hogs; Young Sheep, Northamptonshire. Used also in the same sense in Yorkshire.
John Ray, however, understood hog as meaning domestic pig in A Collection of English Proverbs (1678):
Ne’re lose a hog for an half-penny-worth of tarr.
A man may spare in an ill time: as some who will rather die, then [= than] spend ten groats in Physick. Some have it, lose not a sheep, &c. Indeed tarr is more used about sheep then swine.
The current form of the proverb is first recorded in English Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases (1869), by William Carew Hazlitt (1834-1913):
To spoil the ship for a half-pennyworth of tar.
However, the author adds:
But, in Cornwall, I heard a different version, which appeared to me to be more consistent with probability: “Don’t spoil the sheep for a ha’porth of tar;” and this agrees with a third variation: “Don’t spoil the hog for, &c.,” a hog in some counties (Lincolnshire, for instance,) standing for a sheep of a year old. But, as Mr. Dyce (A General Glossary to Shakespeare’s Works, article ship*) observes, the two words, sheep and ship, seem formerly to have been pronounced very much alike.
(* In fact, this observation appears under sheep: “sheep formerly often pronounced (as it still is in certain counties) ship, and even so written: hence the quibbles”)
In A Concise Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (1993), B. A. Phythian explains that, because of this similarity in pronunciation,
non-countryfolk obviously assumed that the expression referred to a ship, the assumption being reinforced by the reference to tar, which was widely used on wooden ships to coat and preserve the timbers. To complete this transformation of a rustic expression into a nautical-sounding one, the rather extravagant and unconvincing idea of ‘losing’ an entire ship for the sake of a small economy was changed to ‘spoiling’.
Question:
""What usually completes the phrase """"to spoil the ship for a ha'porth of ...""""?""
Answer:
Tar-based shampoo

Dashiki
The dashiki is a colorful garment for men widely worn in West Africa and also worn in other parts of Africa. It covers the top half of the body. It has formal and informal versions and varies from simple draped clothing to fully tailored suits. A common form is a loose-fitting pullover garment, with an ornate V-shaped collar, and tailored and embroidered neck and sleeve lines.

Etymology

The name dashiki is derived from the Hausa word ', which means shirt. It is usually worn with a brimless Kufi cap which is worn in Islamic communities in Africa and the African diaspora, and a pair of pants. In Ghana, the fabric is commonly known by people as ""Angelina"".

History in the West 

The dashiki was made popular in the western parts of the world by Oba (Yoruba word for king) Ofuntola Oseijeman Adelabu Adefunmi, who was born Walter Eugene in Detroit, Michigan, USA in 1928. He became interested in African Studies at the age of 16, and traveled to Haiti at the age of 20 in order to be exposed to African religion from indigenous Africans. Soon after, he returned to the U.S. and began a small scale manufacturing business which included African attire, most notably dashikis.

Versions 

The informal version is a traditional print or embroidered dashiki. Three formal versions exist. The first type consists of a dashiki, sokoto (drawstring trousers), and a matching kufi. This style is called a dashiki suit or dashiki trouser set and it is the attire worn by most grooms during wedding ceremonies. The second version consists of an ankle-length shirt, matching kufi, and sokoto and is called a Senegalese kaftan. The third type consists of a dashiki and matching trousers. A flowing gown is worn over these. This type is called a grand boubou or an agbada.

There are several different styles of dashiki suits available from clothing stores. The type of shirt included in the set determines the name. The traditional dashiki suit includes a thigh-length shirt. The short sleeve, traditional style is preferred by purists. A long dashiki suit includes a shirt that is knee-length or longer. However, if the shirt reaches the ankles, it is a Senegalese kaftan. Finally, the lace dashiki suit includes a shirt made of lace. A hybrid of the dashiki and caftan worn by females is a traditional male dashiki with a western skirt.

Wedding colors 

White is the traditional color for West African weddings.   Most grooms wear white dashiki suits during wedding ceremonies.  Some couples wear non-traditional colours. The most common non-traditional colors are purple and blue.
* Purple and lavender: the color of African royalty. 
* Blue: blue is the color of love, peace, and harmony.

Funeral colors

Black and red are the traditional colors of mourning. 

Dashiki in the United States 

The dashiki found a market in America during the black cultural and political struggles in the 1960s. The dashiki was featured in the movies Uptight (1968), Putney Swope (1969), and the weekly television series Soul Train (1971). Jim Brown, Wilt Chamberlain, Sammy Davis Jr., and Bill Russell were among the well-known African-American athletes and entertainers who wore the dashiki on talk shows. Hippies also adopted dashikis into their wardrobe as a means to express counterculture values.  Former District of Columbia mayor and council member Marion Barry was known for wearing a dashiki leading up to elections.

The term dashiki began appearing in print at least as early as 1967. Reporting on the 1967 Newark riots in the Amsterdam News on July 22, 1967, George Barner refers to a new African garment called a ""danshiki"". An article by Faith Berry in the New York Times Magazine includes it on July 7, 1968.

""Dashiki"" formally appeared in the Webster's New World Dictionary, 1st College Edition 1970/72.  It cites J. Benning as having coined the word in 1967.  J. Benning, M. Clarke, H. Davis and W. Smith were founders of New Breed, the first manufacturer of the garment in the United States, Harlem, New York. York Wong joined the company as Financial Vice President in 1971.

Dashiki has been found on many musicians mostly the African-American musicians including famous ones like Chris Brown ,  Beyonce, Rihanna, Zendaya, ScHoolboy Q,Jhene Aiko,  Q-Tip and many more

He was sacked from The Bill in 1998 for his lack of punctuality and failing to learn his lines. Lloyd died just one week after recording his last scenes for The Bill, and the character of Tosh was still appearing on screen for more than a month after Lloyd's death. His son, James Lloyd, is an actor who also appeared on The Bill between 2004 and 2006. He is the brother of ITN reporter Terry Lloyd who was killed in the Iraq War in 2003. His father, Ellis Aled Lloyd, was himself a police officer who died in an accident while answering an emergency call aged 46 in 1970. He also appeared in Trial by Combat (1976), Britannia Hospital (1982), Don't Open till Christmas (1984) and Link (1986). He also made appearances in the first series of Starting Out, Boon, Minder, Dear John, Farrington of the F.O., Dempsey and Makepeace, Z-Cars, Andy Capp, Auf Wiedersehen Pet, Blake's 7 and Casualty. The full length intro only featured on the CD1 single (and in the music video), but was edited off the Performance & Cocktails album. During live performances, vocalist Kelly Jones has been known to utilise the two bars without vocals before the final chorus to reference the Motörhead song ""Ace of Spades"". The lyrics therefore are ""The bartender and the thief were lovers..."" The track is available on CD2 of the single. Another live version from Sheffield Arena is on the ""Moviestar"" single. The music video features the band playing at Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand and is based on the Francis Ford Coppola movie, Apocalypse Now. A bar version is on CD 1 of the ""I Wouldn't Believe Your Radio"" single, which is available only on CD1 of the album, but is also on CD 2 of the CD2 album, as well as CD 1. The current form of the proverb is first recorded in English Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases (1869), by William Carew Hazlitt (1834-1913) The noun hog was used to denote a young sheep from the time it is weaned until its first shearing.

The Underworld - Greek Mythology
The Underworld
The Underworld
See More The Underworld Pictures >
The Underworld was hidden deep in the earth and was the kingdom of the dead, ruled by god Hades . Hades was a greedy god, whose sole purpose was to increase the number of souls in his kingdom; at the same time, he was very reluctant to let any soul leave. The Erinnyes were welcomed in the Underworld.
For most souls, life in the underworld was not particularly unpleasant. It was rather like being in a miserable dream, full of shadows, ill-lit and desolate, barren of hope; a joyless place where the dead slowly faded into nothingness.
Geographically, the Underworld was considered to have been surrounded by five rivers: the Acheron (river of woe), the Cocytus (river of lamentation), the Phlegethon (river of fire), the Styx (river of unbreakable oath by which the gods took vows), and the Lethe (river of forgetfulness). Past the rivers, a diamond gate, guarded by Cerberus , formed the entrance to the kingdom. Deep within the kingdom, lay Hades ' vast palace, full with guests.
Upon death, a soul was led by Hermes near the entrance of the underworld , where the ferry awaited to carry it across the Acheron. There was a single ferry run by Charon, the boatman who took the souls across the river. Only those who could pay the fare with coins placed on their lips when buried, were granted passage; the rest were trapped between two worlds. After the boat ride, the souls entered through the gates; Cerberus allowed everyone to enter, but none to leave. The souls then appeared before a panel of three judges, Rhadamanthus , Minos , and Aeacus , who passed sentence based on their deeds during their previous life. The souls who were good went to the Elysian Fields, while the others were singled out for special treatment; Sisyphus and Tantalus are two examples of souls that were sentenced to be tormented for eternity.

The Mercury prize nominations for 2009's best album have been announced, and the list features the eclectic lineup of newcomers, chart stars and unknowns the prestigious award has become known for.
Florence and the Machine, Kasabian and Bat for Lashes are the favourites to walk away with the £20,000 prize, voted for by a panel of critics and music industry figures. Synth-pop duo La Roux and Scottish indie-rock quartet Glasvegas are also hotly tipped.
Among the lesser-known artists are south London rapper Speech Debelle and art-rock trio the Invisible, while eccentric quintet Led Bib and folk group Sweet Billy Pilgrim make up the more leftfield nominations.
Typically for the Mercury prize, the omissions are as surprising as the artists that made the final cut. Both Lily Allen (who was also overlooked for her 2006 debut album Alright, Still) and Manchester group Doves were rumoured to be odds on to win, but neither have been nominated.
The Mercury prize was established in 1992 as an alternative to the more commercially minded Brit awards. A panel of industry experts, including journalists, musicians and independent-label executives, debate the merits of what they believe to be the finest British albums from the past year, regardless of sales or radio play. Previous winners include Portishead, PJ Harvey and Arctic Monkeys.
But the Mercury prize's reputation as an awards ceremony that celebrates quality over sales has come in for a bashing in recent years as the prize itself grows in stature. ""I think there's a tendency for a knee-jerk negative reaction to the Mercury nominations – to see what's not on the list, what they've missed out,"" said the Guardian's chief pop critic Alexis Petridis. ""The whole concept behind the shortlist is really nebulous. Is it artistic endeavour? Or is it a degree of commercial success, because there's certainly never any outright commercial flops on the list?"" Petridis continues: ""There's not a vast amount in the way of dance or urban music, nor are there artists with any kind of lengthy history. I'm not sure what happened to Manic Street Preachers' nomination, but there you go.""
As for Lily Allen and that phantom nomination, the singer has already taken to her Twitter page to say, ""I hope La Roux wins"".
The winner of this year's award will be announced on 8 September 2009.

It is very easy to get lost in the moment during the tense theater of battle while watching a Brazilian jiu jitsu competition, boxing match, or mixed martial arts event. Competing martial artists generally practice their skills and train for hundreds of hours longer than their matches ever last, and the number of different training modalities necessary to be successful can be overwhelming. Conditioning the martial arts athlete might not be as easy as it seems at first and there are many schools of thought.
 
The martial arts athlete should be very wise when implementing any strength and conditioning training that does not directly involve enhancing specific combat skills. As a strength and conditioning coach for several MMA fighters, I have always lived by the philosophy that the training I do with these athletes should only enhance all of their other training. Most competitive combat sport athletes train at least twice a day and I have found that too many strength coaches overwork these athletes, as if it was another 10-round sparring session. Or, even worse, coaches implement ineffective conditioning programs that do not benefit the athlete or add to their overall training. I am not here to break down my athletes, or even more importantly, waste their time. I have to give them exactly what they need to complement their skills to be successful in competition.
 
Conditioning for the combat athlete is not exactly simple. These athletes need to have a balance between quick, explosive, and repetitive strength production, as well as have the endurance capacity to maintain these qualities over a match lasting anywhere from 5 to 25 minutes. Some coaches like implementing long runs. Though these runs might be effective for a completely unconditioned athlete who needs to create a foundation, if used too much you will have a weak and non-explosive athlete. On the other hand, if you solely concentrate on explosive work, such as Olympic lifting, you have an explosive athlete with little stamina, who better connect with the first couple of punches or else he/she is going to gas out and become a human punching bag for the opponent.
 
So, it sounds like an impossible task to train for both explosive strength and endurance and to do it without running your athlete to the ground. It can be accomplished, though, and one of the best tools I have found for the job is using the kettlebell for training circuits. By manipulating different weights, using dynamics exercises, and varying time intervals, kettlebells allow the combat athlete to be strong, explosive, and have a high level of endurance to maintain those qualities over the course of their match.
 
In this article I am going to show you how I use kettlebell circuits with my athletes. You do not need to train or even be a combat athlete to enjoy the benefits of these circuits. All you need is a kettlebell or two and the desire to get better.
 
When I create and customize kettlebell circuits for combat athletes there are a few concepts I consider when incorporating them into the athlete’s overall program:
 
Kettlebell exercises should be multi-joint movements that enhance athletic movements, like squats, lunges, and swings.
Circuit times should be around a 2:1 work to rest ratio. I prefer 20-60 seconds of work and 10-30 seconds of rest. I also like to make the total circuit times replicate the rounds for their competition. For example, if a round in competition is 3 minutes then the circuit total time should be around 3 minutes of work as well.
Each exercise should be safe to perform at a continuous and fast rate.
The exercise selection should be balanced and organized properly. You want to incorporate double joint movements (squats, deadlifts, 2-arm swings) with unilateral (single-sided) movements as well (lunges, Romanian deadlifts, and 1-arm swings).
 
Below are some examples of strength and conditioning circuits I use to get my athletes in shape and performing at their best.

Child Is Father of the Man
""Child Is Father of the Man"" is a song written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks. Originally recorded by the American rock band the Beach Boys, it was to be included on their projected album Smile. Due to the project's abandonment, the intended nature of the piece is mostly unknown. The result left is a nearly instrumental piece with the words ""child"" and ""father of the man"" sung over the chorus. Biographer Jon Stebbins describes the track: ""a brooding and expansive aura, with a plaintive harmonica line not dissimilar to those heard on Ennio Morricone spaghetti western soundtracks."" 

In 2004, Wilson completed the track for his album Brian Wilson Presents Smile. This rerecorded version incorporated an additional set of lyrics penned by Parks. In 2011, the Beach Boys' version was released for the first time as part of The Smile Sessions box set.

Composition

""Child is father of the man"" is an idiom originating from the poem ""My Heart Leaps Up"" by William Wordsworth. In a 1966 interview, Wilson mistakenly attributed it to Karl Menninger, and added that the saying had fascinated him.  There exist many different interpretations of the phrase, the most popular of which is man being the product of habits and behavior developed in youth. According to collaborator Van Dyke Parks, he brought up the idiom to Wilson.

Recording

Several sections of the song were recorded, but aside from a group piano demo, only one variation of the chorus's backing track was overdubbed with vocals sung in elaborate musical rounds. The structure was never finalized. According to The Smile Sessions compiler Mark Linett, ""When he's not singing, you can hear faint background vocal parts that no longer exist on the multitrack. They must have been in his headphones, and were picked up by the vocal mic. It could be that Brian decided he didn't need them, or that he was going to re-record them, but never did. You hear this sort of stuff throughout the tapes.""  The song was worked on between October and December 1966. After one more revisit in April 1967, the track was abandoned forever by the group.

Decades later in both The Smile Sessions and Brian Wilson Presents Smile, the song was included as the third track of the second movement. ""Child Is Father of the Man"" precedes ""Surf's Up"" and follows ""Look (Song for Children)"". On The Smile Sessions, some vocals from ""Surf's Up"" were digitally inserted into the instrumental track. When rerecorded by Wilson in 2004, he sang newly written lyrics by Parks (Easy, my child / It's just enough to believe / Out of the wild / into what you can conceive / You'll achieve).   

Legacy

The song's chorus was later rewritten and rerecorded as the chorus for ""Little Bird"", a song on the band's 1968 Friends album released as a single.  It was then quoted within the closing section of ""Surf's Up"", which ended up appearing on their 1971 album of the same name.

He is also known for appearing on the third series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, and the thirteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing, in which he was partnered with Janette Manrara.

During his time on I'm A Celebrity, Andre developed an on-screen romantic relationship with fellow contestant, Katie Price. Andre and Price got married two years after the show's finale; they had two children, and released the 2006 album A Whole New World together, before divorcing in 2009.

In 2009, Andre released the album Revelation with the single ""Behind Closed Doors"", which reached No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart. He followed it up with his sixth studio album Accelerate in 2010.

Early life

Peter Andre was born on 27 February 1973 in Harrow, London. The family lived on the Gold Coast in Queensland during Andre's teenage years.

Their 2009 separation resulted in their individual shows being recorded: Peter Andre: The Next Chapter continued on ITV2 until 2011, followed by Peter Andre: Here 2 Help (2011) and Peter Andre: My Life (2011–13).

In July 2010, Andre and Jason Manford were team captains on the ITV series Odd One In.

In August 2015, he was announced as a contestant for the thirteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing which began in September 2015 in which he was partnered with Janette Manrara. They went out just before the quarter final; on week 10, and therefore finished seventh place.

Personal life

Andre began dating glamour model Katie Price after they met on reality show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in early 2004. The couple got engaged secretly in May of the same year but it wasn't announced publicly until months later. Andre married Price on 10 September 2005 in Highclere Castle, Hampshire. They have two children together: son Junior Savva, born on 13 June 2005, and daughter Princess Tiaamii Crystal Esther, born on 29 June 2007.  While married to Price, Andre was stepfather to her son Harvey, a blind and autistic child from Price's earlier relationship with football player Dwight Yorke. 

In May 2009, it was announced that André and Price had separated after 3½ years of marriage.  They were officially divorced on 8 September 2009. 

Since July 2012, Andre has been in a relationship with medical student Emily MacDonagh, who is 16 years his junior.  MacDonagh gave birth to Andre's third child, a girl named Amelia, on 7 January 2014.  Andre and MacDonagh married on 11 July 2015 in Exeter at Mamhead House.

âBen Hurâ the movie is everything youâve heard: epic, massively entertaining, highly innovative, and an absolute must-see film.  This disc of âBen Hurâ is another matter altogether.  I focus here on the disc.
PLUSES:  It is the full-length film and, significantly, the Technicolor scenes are intact and in color.
MINUSES:  This disc is of Korean manufacture.  The disc itself was fine, but someone has inserted a bright blue logo on top of the black and white film; it persists throughout the credits, and bizarrely reappears for no apparent reason during one scene.  As the only color element in those sequences, it is distracting.  I have no idea whose logo it is.  Perhaps more significantly, there are visual artifacts during fast-action scenes.  These take the form of horizontal banding that looks like rasterization.  Whatever the cause, the defect looks digital, not optical.  And in a film whose glory lies in no small part on action scenes, this is a major flaw.
NITS:  On the case cover, the movie title is mistranslated as âBen Hur: A Tales of Christ.â  No the cover doesnât really hurt anything, and the titles within the movie are the original Hollywood slides, so theyâre fine.  But for a full-price disc, this obvious error seems cheap.
ALTERNATIVES:  Amazon hypes this disc by saying ânot available in the US.â  Not quite.  This silent version is included as an extra on the Blu-ray 4-disc boxed set of the 1959 remake, which is pricey.  I also have seen a regular DVD 4-disc set that includes the silent version in its extras as well, for a more reasonable cost.  (I do not think the silent version is included with the Blu-ray 2-disc set.)  I canât speak personally to the quality of these transfers, but I have to imagine youâd at least not have the looming logo thatâs present on the Korean disc.
THE BOTTOM LINE:  Magnificent movie, see it.  This is a very tatty disc for full priceâ¦hold out for a better version.

Those who may dislike silent films may change their minds after seeing this one.
This retelling of the classic novel is actually the second, not fist filmed version as commonly believed (the original was a crude early silent from 1907 that is of historical interest only). This version is a well told drama full of thrills and excitement about the Jewish wealthy heir who faces treachery from his childhood friend and forced into slavery. Much has been said about the story, but it is really well told here. Great acting, chariot races, ship battles, and even a few scenes in early technicolor. In some ways, it precedes KING OF KINGS two years later in 1927 with the color scenes, high production quality, and the Jesus Christ aspects. It is so exciting and well done that as is the case with KING OF KINGS, it may convert haters of silent cinema into fans of the genre.

Mesmerizing!  This may be a silent film, but as with all silent films there is an amazing quality that draws you deeper into the visual and dramatic spectacular of this tale.  If you're even the least religious or searching this film will definitely impact your life.  Not ""true"" black and white in that there is a sepia that lends a vintage look to the frames, which is not as drawing on the eyes.  The clarity of this film is unbelievably sharp.  It's as though it were made yesterday.  Very much worth purchasing.

I have always enjoyed the story of Ben Hur. I enjoy the Charlton Heston version and being a Ramon Navarro fan I wanted to take a chance and see how I would enjoy this silent. I have never been a fan of the Silent films but I have to say I really enjoyed this one. It was amazing to see what the fuss was about. This movie was amazing. It really pulled me in and I found myself really enjoying it. If you are a fan of silent Films or even Ramon Navarro, you may want to take a look at this gem. To think it will soon be 100 years old in 12 more years.

","Passage:
Clun Forest
Clun Forest is a remote, rural area of open pastures, moorland and mixed deciduous/coniferous woodland in the southwest part of the English county of Shropshire and also just over the border into Powys, Wales.

It was once a large forest covering an area that stretched from Ludlow up the Clun Valley. It now is only forested in some wooded areas, such as Radnor Wood, though a fairly large area of forest exists on the Wales–England border north of Anchor (the planted Ceri Forest).

The ancient Offa's Dyke runs north-south through the area (and can be walked by the Offa's Dyke Path).

It is a deanery of the Church of England's Diocese of Hereford. 

A Shropshire Lad 

A. E. Housman wrote as part of his series of poems A Shropshire Lad:

    ""In valleys of springs of rivers      
       By Ony and Teme and Clun,          
    The country for easy livers,          
       The quietest under the sun...

    'Tis a long way further than Knighton,
       A quieter place than Clun,         
    Where doomsday may thunder and lighten
       And little 'twill matter to one.""
Question:
Clun Forest lies in which English county?
Answer:
Salopia
Passage:
Tongue and groove
A strong joint, the tongue and groove joint is widely used for re-entrant angles. The effect of wood shrinkage is concealed when the joint is beaded or otherwise moulded.  In expensive cabinet work, glued dovetail and multiple tongue and groove are used.

Tongue and groove is a method of fitting similar objects together, edge to edge, used mainly with wood, in flooring, parquetry, panelling, and similar constructions. Tongue and groove joints allow two flat pieces to be joined strongly together to make a single flat surface. Before plywood became common, tongue and groove boards were also used for sheathing buildings and to construct concrete formwork.

Each piece has a slot (the groove) cut all along one edge, and a thin, deep ridge (the tongue) on the opposite edge. The tongue projects a little less than the depth of the groove. Two or more pieces thus fit together closely. The joint is not normally glued, as shrinkage would then pull the tongue off.

In another assembly method, the pieces are end-matched. This method eliminates the need for mitre joints, face nailing, and the use of joints on 16 inch or 24 inch centres of conventional framing.

For many uses, tongue and groove boards have been rendered obsolete by the introduction of plywood and later composite wood boards, but the method is still used in higher-quality.  Plywood may also be tongued all round to fit it flush into a framed structure, and plywood for sub-floors used in platform framing is often supplied with tongue and groove edges.

When joining thicker materials, several tongue and groove joints may be used one above the other.

Methods

One of the following woodworking tools may be used to produce the tongue and groove:
* A four- or six-head moulder (for large quantities)
* A wood shaper (spindle moulder)
* A circular saw bench
* Suitable hand planes: a plough plane for the groove and a tongue plane for the tongue, or a combination plane
* A spindle router

Tongue-in-groove

Tongue-in-groove is similar to tongue and groove, but instead of the tongue forming part of one of the edges, it is a separate, loose piece that fits between two identically grooved edges. The tongue may or may not be of the same material as the grooved pieces joined by the tongue. For example, plywood flooring is commonly grooved at the edges, and plastic tongues are used to form the joint.
Question:
A tongue and groove joint is used when working with what material?
Answer:
Diffuse-porous wood

Senegal
Senegal (;   ), officially the Republic of Senegal (), is a country located in West Africa. Senegal is bordered by the North African country of Mauritania in the north, Mali to the east, Guinea to the southeast, and Guinea-Bissau to the southwest. Senegal further borders the country of The Gambia, a sovereign enclave occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the Gambia river, which separates Senegal's southern region of Casamance from the rest of the country. Senegal also shares a maritime border with the country of Cape Verde. Senegal's economical and political capital is Dakar. It is the westernmost country in the mainland of the Old World, or Afro-Eurasia,  and owes its name to the Senegal River, which borders it to the east and north. The name ""Senegal"" comes from the Wolof ""Sunuu Gaal,"" which means ""Our Boat."" Senegal covers a land area of almost 197000 km2}} and has an estimated population of about 13 million. The climate is Sahelian, but there is a rainy season.

Cultures and influences 

The territory of modern Senegal has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since the Prehistory. Organized kingdoms emerged around the seventh century, and parts of the country were ruled by prominent regional empires such as the Jolof Empire. The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism, which began during the mid-15th century, when various European powers began competing for trade in the area. The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland, culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century, albeit amid much local resistance. Senegal peacefully attained independence from France in 1960, and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa.

Senegal's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources. Major industries are fish processing, phosphate mining, fertilizer production, petroleum refining, construction materials, ship construction and repair. As in most African nations, agriculture is a major sector, with Senegal producing several important cash crops, including peanuts, sugarcane, cotton, green beans, tomatoes, melons, and mangoes.Ndiaye, Mbalo.

MICHAEL JACKSON LYRICS - Billie Jean - Song Lyrics from A to Z
MICHAEL JACKSON LYRICS - Billie Jean
MICHAEL JACKSON LYRICS
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
[2nd verse]
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
[Bridge]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
[3rd verse]
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(do think twice.)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three
Then she looked at me
She showed a photo of a baby crying
His eyes looked like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby
[Bridge]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, she says he is my son
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover

Real, Inspired and Allegorical Figures in Poster Art
Poster art often features the human figure.  In many cases, the figure is solely an illustration conjured from the imagination of the artist.
Stephane, Cognac Briand, c. 1925
In some instances, the figure is modeled after a real person such as in The Lefevre-Utile ‘LU’ Biscuits poster by David Lance Goines. This image was inspired by Ginger LeFevre, a descendant of the famous cookie family, and Goines shows the little girl reaching for a cookie jar. Likewise, Firmin Bouisset, used his children as models for many of his posters.
Left: Goines, Lu Biscuit Right: Bouisset, Maggi
Sometimes posters feature allegorical figures. Like the advertising posters which came before them, posters from the First World War were designed to motivate the viewer to enlist in the army, or to buy a war bond.  They also had a secondary imperative: to inspire the viewer.  In fact, in the United States, posters were part of a campaign of salesmanship to get the American public behind the war.  American Posters used figures like Uncle Sam, Columbia, and Lady Liberty allegorically.  French Bond Posters used Marianne.
Silver coin featuring Marianne
Marianne is the personification of the Republique Francaise and a symbol of liberty and freedom.  Images of Marianne first appear in 1775 and depict her standing, young and determined, sometimes bare breasted as she leads soldiers into battle.  Her image is allegorical, and is inspired by another allegorical figure, that of Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom and war.
The figure was used on the French postage stamp in 1849, and also on the franc.  Today she appears on the French Euro coin.  We encounter Marianne occasionally in the advertising poster.
Advertising poster for Saponite Laundry Soap, featuring Marianne berating a seated Napoleon
She is, however, best enjoyed in the poster in French World War One Bond and Reconstruction posters.
M. Richard Butz, Souscrivez Pour la Victoire, 1916
In this poster,  created early in the war, a fierce Marianne flies over a battlefield littered with dead soldiers.  Behind her, soldiers march triumphantly.  After one and a half years of brutal battles and many losses, France needed such imagery to stay the course.
Lelong, Credit Nationale, 1920
This reconstruction poster by Rene Lelong features Marianne in red wearing laurels of victory.  She smites a battleaxe turning her blade in for a plough.  The poster is populated with a blacksmith, a teacher, and a farmer, suggesting that France will enjoy a renaissance in construction, culture, and agriculture when the bond is sold successfully.
Droit, Emprunt National, 1920
This beautiful and peaceful image by Lt. Jean Droit shows Marianne steering a boat,  representing commerce, import, and export, through calm waters.  In this image, she wears the Phrygian cap, an ancient symbol of freedom and liberty, which is a typical feature of her garb.
If you visit Paris, keep an eye out for Marianne.  If you know what to look for, you will no doubt spot her.  Here she is at Place de Nation in Paris.
Marianne at Place de Nation
This noble Marianne statue was created by Aime Jules Dalou in 1899, and it is a strong image of history and inspiration.  Although Marianne never lived, her iconic image has left an imprint in France for over a period of almost 225 years.  We feel we know her, we feel we have seen her before, and that we can relate to her.  I guess that is exactly what a good allegory is designed to do.

Passage:
Gulf of Guinea
The Gulf of Guinea is the northeasternmost part of the tropical Atlantic Ocean between Cape Lopez in Gabon, north and west to Cape Three Points in Western region Ghana. The intersection of the Equator and Prime Meridian (zero degrees latitude and longitude) is in the gulf.

Among the many rivers that drain into the Gulf of Guinea are the Niger and the Volta. The coastline on the gulf includes the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Bonny.

The Niger River in particular deposited organic sediments out to sea over millions of years which became crude oil. The Gulf of Guinea region, along with the Congo River delta and Angola further south, are expected to provide around a quarter of the United States' oil imports by 2015. This region is now regarded as one of the world's top oil and gas exploration hotspots.

Name

The origin of the name Guinea is thought to be an area in the region, although the specifics are disputed. Bovill (1995) gives a thorough description: 

The name Guinea is usually said to have been a corrupt form of the name Ghana, picked up by the Portuguese in the Maghrib. The present writer finds this unacceptable. The name Guinea has been in use both in the Maghrib and in Europe long before Prince Henry's time. For example, on a map dated about 1320 by the Genoese cartographer Giovanni di Carignano, who got his information about Africa from a fellow-countryman in Sijilmas [ancient trading city in North Africa], we find Gunuia, and in the Catalan atlas of 1375 as Ginyia. A passage in Leo [Africanus] (vol. III, 822) points to Guinea having been a corrupt form of Jenne [2,000-year-old city in central Mali on Niger river], less famous than Ghana but nevertheless for many centuries famed in the Maghrib as a great market and a seat of learning. The relevant passage reads: ""The Kingdom of Ghinea . . . called by the merchants of our nation Gheneoa, by the natural inhabitants thereof Genni and by the Portugals and other people of Europe Ghinea."" But it seems more probable that Guinea derives from aguinaou, the Berber for Negro. Marrakech [city in southeastern Morocco] has a gate, built in the twelfth century, called the Bab Aguinaou, the Gate of the Negro (Delafosse, Haut-Sénégal-Niger, II, 277-278). The modern application of the name Guinea to the coast dates only from 1481. In that year the Portuguese built a fort, São Jorge da Mina (modern day Elmina), on the Gold Coast region, and their king, John II, was permitted by the Pope [Sixtus II or Innocent VIII] to style himself Lord of Guinea, a title that survived until the recent extinction of the monarchy.

The name ""Guinea"" was also applied to south coast of West Africa, north of the Gulf of Guinea, which became known as ""Upper Guinea"", and the west coast of Southern Africa, to the east, which became known as ""Lower Guinea."" The name ""Guinea"" is still attached to the names of three countries in Africa: Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea, as well as New Guinea in Melanesia.

Geography

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the southwest extent of the Gulf of Guinea as ""A line running Southeastward from Cape Three Points in Western region Ghana () to Cape Lopez in Gabon ()"". 

Islands in the Gulf of Guinea

The Gulf of Guinea contains a number of islands, the largest of which are in a southwest-northeast chain, forming part of the Cameroon line of volcanoes.

Annobón

Annobón, also known as Pagalu or Pigalu, is an island that is part of Equatorial Guinea.

Bobowasi Island

Bobowasi Island is an island off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea that is part of Western region Ghana.

Bioko

Bioko is an island off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea that is part of Equatorial Guinea.

Corisco

Corisco is an island belonging to Equatorial Guinea.

The Elobeys

Elobey Grande and Elobey Chico are two small islands belonging to Equatorial Guinea.

São Tomé and Príncipe

São Tomé and Príncipe (officially the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe) is a Portuguese-speaking island nation in the Gulf of Guinea that became independent from Portugal in 1975. It is located off the western equatorial coast of Africa and consists of two islands, São Tomé and Príncipe. They are located about 140 km apart and about 250 and, respectively, off the northwestern coast of Gabon. Both islands are part of an extinct volcanic mountain range. São Tomé, the sizeable southern island, is situated just north of the Equator.

Mar Chiquita Lake (Córdoba)
Mar Chiquita (in Spanish literally ""Little Sea"") or Mar de Ansenuza is an endorheic salt lake located in the northeast of the province of Córdoba, in central Argentina. The northeast corner of the lake also extends into southeastern Santiago del Estero Province. It is the largest of the naturally occurring saline lakes in Argentina. The lake is located in parts of five departments in the two provinces.

The lake occupies the southern part of a depression that measures about 50 miles/80 km (north–south) by 28 miles/45 km (east–west). Its surface area varies considerably, given its shallow depth (about 10 m), and ranges between 2000 and 6000 km² (1242 and 3728 mi²).

Mar Chiquita is fed primarily by the saline waters of the Dulce River, coming from Santiago del Estero in the north after being joined by the Saladillo River. The lands around the lower course of the Dulce and Mar Chiquita are wetlands, populated by a large biodiversity (especially aquatic birds). From the southwest the lake receives the flow of the Primero/Suquía and the Segundo/Xanaes rivers, as well as several streams; these inflows vary greatly from dry to rainy seasons. The salinity of Mar Chiquita is quite variable, with measured extremes ranging from 250 g/l in times of low water levels to around 40 g/l in very humid years, such as in the decade following 1977, when record rainfall flooded much of Miramar, Córdoba.

There are several islands in the lake, the most important one being the Médano Island. Mar Chiquita is slowly diminishing in volume due to increased evaporation and elevation of its bottom, and is ultimately bound to turn into a salt flat. The lake was formerly home to a growing tourism industry, and was the site of the Gran Hotel Vienna, a luxurious, lakefront establishment which functioned from 1945 to 1980, and has been the center of numerous mysteries and controversies.

Fanta
Fanta is a global brand of fruit-flavored carbonated soft drinks created by The Coca-Cola Company. There are over 100 flavors worldwide. The drink originated in Nazi Germany under trade embargo for Coca-Cola ingredients in 1940.

History 

Fanta originated as a result of difficulties importing Coca-Cola syrup into Nazi Germany during World War II due to a trade embargo. To circumvent this, Max Keith, the head of Coca-Cola Deutschland (Coca-Cola GmbH) during the Second World War, decided to create a new product for the German market, using only ingredients available in Germany at the time, including whey and apple pomace – the ""leftovers of leftovers"", as Keith later recalled.  The name was the result of a brief brainstorming session, which started with Keith's exhorting his team to ""use their imagination"" (Fantasie in German), to which one of his salesmen, Joe Knipp, immediately retorted ""Fanta!""

The plant was effectively cut off from Coca-Cola headquarters during the war. After the war, the Coca-Cola corporation regained control of the plant, formula and the trademarks to the new Fanta product—as well as the plant profits made during the war.

Fanta was discontinued when the parent company was reunited with the German branch.  Following the launch of several drinks by the Pepsi corporation in the 1950s, Coca-Cola competed by relaunching Fanta in 1955.  The drink was heavily marketed in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America.

Fanta is known for its upbeat advertising; in the United States, it showcases The Fantanas, a group of young female models, each of whom promotes an individual Fanta flavor. For the re-introduction of Fanta in the United States, Coca-Cola worked with the ad agency Ogilvy (NYC) in 2001. After a brainstorming session, the Ogilvy creative team of Andrea Scaglione, Andrew Ladden and Bill Davaris, created the tagline ""Wanta Fanta!"" which became the jingle for the Fantanas in the broadcast campaign. The campaign lasted from summer 2001, in the form of a successful trial run, to October 1, 2006. Three years later, in June 2009, Fanta re-launched the campaign. They also held a talent search to find the pineapple Fantana, and, in September selected Shakira Barrera to become the fourth Fantana.  After Barrera won the search, she spent a year at her post, with the latter six months as an actual Fantana called Lily.

International availability 

There are over 90 different flavors worldwide. In Serbia, Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia and some other countries, there is ""Fanta Shokata"" (a wordplay between ""soc"" -elderberry in Romanian- and ""shock"") based on an elderflower blossom extract drink, traditional in Romania (where it is called Socată), Serbia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia and other Balkan countries.

Orange Fanta is also available in Canada; however, the formula for Canada's Orange variant differs from its American and German/European counterparts, notably in that the German contains orange juice,  the Canadian contains tangerine juice  and the American contains neither.  The other variants available in Canada are Grape and Cream Soda, both made with real grapes. 

Primary competitors to Fanta have included Tango, Mirinda, Slice, Sumol, Crush, Tropicana Twister and Orangina. Fanta was the second drink to be produced by Coca-Cola, after the original Coca-Cola.

International popularity 

*In Australia, there are Fanta Labs in many shopping malls. Fanta Lab provides 2 identical ""Labs"" where there is a set of water filter cups to the side and a touch screen, which shows the four available Australian flavors, Mango-Passionfruit, Orange, Grape, and Raspberry, and can choose 4 flavors to be mixed. Therefore, can mix 2 flavors twice, 3 flavors, 4 flavors, or just get a free cup of original Fanta.
* In Japan, the market often issues seasonal rare flavours like yuzu.
* In Greece you can find a non-carbonated version of the original Orange Fanta, called Fanta Blue

Controversy 

A 2005 British television advertisement for Fanta Z showed a couple enjoying a picnic on a beach and drinking from their cans of Fanta Light, but then calmly spitting the drink out. Others were also shown spitting the drink out in similar ways. The viewers complained that the ad condoned spitting and that children were reported to have copied the ad. A head teacher said that children in the playground had mimicked the commercial. The majority of complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the images were disgusting and thought it was inappropriate because spitting posed a health risk. The ad became restricted to the post-9pm broadcasts. The ASA agreed that viewers would not want children to see something perceived as anti-social, but did not consider that the images showing people spitting would cause widespread offense or pose a significant health risk. 

75th anniversary advertisement 

In February 2015, a 75th anniversary version of Fanta was released in Germany. Packaged in glass bottles evoking the original design and with an authentic original war-time flavor including 30% whey and pomace, it is described on the packaging as ""less sweet"" and a German original. An associated television ad referenced the history of the drink and said the Coca-Cola company wanted to bring back ""the feeling of the Good Old Times"" which was interpreted by many to mean Nazi rule. The ad was subsequently replaced.

Cyclades
The Cyclades (; ,) are an island group in the Aegean Sea, southeast of mainland Greece and a former administrative prefecture of Greece. They are one of the island groups which constitute the Aegean archipelago. The name refers to the islands around (κυκλάς) the sacred island of Delos. The Cyclades is where the native Greek breed of cat (the Aegean cat) originated.

History

The significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Cycladic culture is best known for its schematic, flat idols carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age (""Minoan"") culture arose in Crete, to the south: these figures have been looted from burials to satisfy a thriving Cycladic antiquities market since the early 20th century.

A distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on emmer wheat and wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites include Saliagos and Kephala (on Keos) with signs of copper-working, Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities (Rutter), and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos, which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout antiquity and until the emergence of Christianity.

Archaeology

The first archaeological excavations of the 1880s were followed by systematic work by the British School at Athens and by Christos Tsountas, who investigated burial sites on several islands in 1898–1899 and coined the term ""Cycladic civilization"". Interest lagged, then picked up in the mid-20th century, as collectors competed for the modern-looking figures that seemed so similar to sculpture by Jean Arp or Constantin Brâncuși. Sites were looted and a brisk trade in forgeries arose. The context for many of these Cycladic figurines has been mostly destroyed and their meaning may never be completely understood. Another intriguing and mysterious object is that of the Cycladic frying pans. More accurate archaeology has revealed the broad outlines of a farming and seafaring culture that had immigrated from Asia Minor c. 5000 BCE. Early Cycladic culture evolved in three phases, between c.  3300 – 2000 BCE, when it was increasingly swamped in the rising influence of Minoan Crete. The culture of mainland Greece contemporary with Cycladic culture is called Helladic culture.

In recent decades the Cyclades islands have become popular with European and other tourists, and as a result there have been problems with erosion, pollution, and water shortages.

Geography

The Cyclades comprise about 220 islands, the major ones being Amorgos, Anafi, Andros, Antiparos, Delos, Eschati, Ios, Kea, Kimolos, Kythnos, Milos, Mykonos, Naxos, Paros, Folegandros, Serifos, Sifnos, Sikinos, Syros, Tinos, and Thira or Santoríni. The name ""Cyclades"" refers to the islands forming a circle (""circular islands"") around the sacred island of Delos. Most of the smaller islands are uninhabited.

Ermoupolis, on Syros, is the chief town and administrative center of the former prefecture.

The islands are peaks of a submerged mountainous terrain, with the exception of two volcanic islands, Milos and Santorini. The climate is generally dry and mild, but with the exception of Naxos the soil is not very fertile; agricultural produce includes wine, fruit, wheat, olive oil, and tobacco.  Cooler temperatures are in higher elevations and mainly do not receive wintry weather.

The Cyclades are bounded to the south by the Sea of Crete. 

Administration

The Cyclades Prefecture () was one of the prefectures of Greece. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was abolished, and its territory was divided into nine regional units of the South Aegean region:
* Andros
* Kea-Kythnos
* Milos
* Mykonos
* Naxos
* Paros
* Santorini
* Syros
* Tinos

Municipalities and communities

The prefecture was subdivided into the following municipalities and communities. These have been reorganised at the 2011 Kallikratis reform as well.

Spinach - Produce Depot
• Excellent source of vitamin K.
• Great source of Vitamin A
• Good source of manganese, folate, and vitamin C
• Source of Iron, Magnesium and Potassium
In animal studies, researchers have found that spinach may help protect the brain from oxidative stress and may reduce the effects of age-related related declines in brain function. Research indicates that eating a spinach rich diet significantly improved learning capacity and motor skills in adults.
Choosing & Storing:
Choose spinach that has vibrant deep green leaves and stems with no signs of yellowing. The leaves should look fresh and tender, and not be wilted or bruised. Store fresh spinach loosely packed in a plastic bag in the refrigerator crisper where it will keep fresh for about five days. Do not wash it before storing as the moisture will cause it to spoil. Avoid storing cooked spinach as it will not keep very well.
 
Tips for Preparing Spinach: 
Spinach should be washed very well since the leaves and stems tend to collect sand and soil. Before washing, trim off the roots and separate the leaves. Cut away any overly thick stems to ensure for more even cooking.
Spinach can be quick boiled for one minute. Boiling will help to reduce the amount of oxalic acids found in spinach, resulting in a sweeter taste.
Add layers of steamed spinach to your next lasagna recipe.
Toss steamed spinach with pressed garlic, fresh lemon juice and olive oil.
Sprinkle with a little Parmesan cheese.
Replace spinach for basil in pesto recipes and make spinach pesto.
Spinach salads are a classic easy and delicious meal or side dish.

It was once a large forest covering an area that stretched from Ludlow up the Clun Valley. The ancient Offa's Dyke runs north-south through the area. It is a deanery of the Church of England's Diocese of Hereford. The tongue and groove is a method of fitting similar objects together, edge to edge, used mainly with wood, in flooring, parquetry, panelling, and similar constructions. Tongue and groove boards have been rendered obsolete by the introduction of plywood and later composite wood boards, but the method is still used in higher-quality. For example, plywood may also be tongued all round to fit it flush into a framed structure, and plywood for sub-floors used in platform framing is often supplied with tongue andgroove edges. The effect of wood shrinkage is concealed when the joint is beaded or otherwise moulded. The joint is not normally glued, as shrinkage would then pull the tongue off. It can also be end-matched, which eliminates the need for mitre joints, face nailing, and the use of joints on 16 inch or 24 inch centres of conventional framing. The Tongue-in-groove is similar to the tongue but instead of forming one of the edges, it is a separate piece that fits between two grooved edges, or may not be the same material as the grooved pieces joined by the tongue. The tongues and grooves are commonly used to form the edges of plastic flooring and plastic walls, for example, and are used to make flooring in the West African country of Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and further further south in the Horn of Africa. For more information on the tongue and groove, see: http://www.tongueandgroove.org/Tongue-In-Groove-Joints.html.

Senegal is the westernmost country in the mainland of the Old World, or Afro-Eurasia. It owes its name to the Senegal River, which borders it to the east and north. The name ""Senegal"" comes from the Wolof ""Sunuu Gaal,"" which means ""Our Boat"" Senegal covers a land area of almost 197,000 km2 and has an estimated population of about 13 million. It peacefully attained independence from France in 1960, and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa. Senegal's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources. Major industries are fish processing, phosphate mining, fertilizer production, petroleum refining, construction materials, ship construction and repair. As in most African nations, agriculture is a major sector, with Senegal producing several important cash crops, including peanuts, sugarcane, cotton, green beans, tomatoes, melons, and mangoes. The climate is Sahelian, but there is a rainy season. Senegal is a small enclave occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the Gambia river, which separates Senegal's southern region of Casamance from the rest of the country. Senegal also shares a maritime border with the country of Cape Verde, and its economical and political capital is Dakar. It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with a population of around 13 million people. The country has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since the Prehistory. The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism, which began during the mid-15th century, when various European powers began competing for trade in the area. The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland, culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century. The West African Republic, on the river of the same name, is a narrow 200 mile east-west strip within Senegal. It has been ruled by prominent regional empires such as the Jolof Empire since the seventh century. It was ruled by French rule until 1960, when it peacefully attainedindependence from France. The current president is Alassane Ouattara, who was sworn in on January 1, 2011. He is the son of former President Idriss Déby, who died in a plane crash on January 2, 2012. The president is the grandson of independence leader Leopold II, who fled to Senegal in 1961. Alexis Sanchez became the first man to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, Serie A and La Liga on Saturday. The Chile international scored a hat-trick against Leicester in the 5-2 win. Sanchez's first treble came in his Udinese days in 2011, when he scored a first-half treble against Palermo. He also scored a treble in Spain for Barcelona in January 2014, in a 4-0 victory against Elche. Sanchez returned to form after a slow start to the season with three goals against Leicester. He is now the first player to score three goals in Serie A, La Liga and the top flight in England. His treble guided Arsenal to a hard fought victory against Leicester, who were beaten in the league for the first time this season. The Gunners face Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.

Images of Marianne first appear in 1775 and depict her standing, young and determined, sometimes bare breasted as she leads soldiers into battle. Her image is allegorical, and is inspired by another allegorical figure, that of Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom and war. In some instances, the figure is modeled after a real person such as in The Lefevre-Utile ‘LU’ Biscuits poster by David Lance Goines. In fact, in the United States, posters were part of a campaign of salesmanship to get the American public behind the war. American Posters used figures like Uncle Sam, Columbia, and Lady Liberty allegorically. French Bond Posters use Marianne in red wearing laurels of victory. She smites a battleaxe turning her blade in for a plough. The poster is populated with a blacksmith, a teacher, and a farmer, suggesting that France will enjoy a renaissance in construction, culture, and agriculture when the bond is sold successfully. After one and a half years of brutal battles and many losses, France needed such imagery to stay the course. Although Marianne never lived, her iconic image has left an imprint in France for over a period of almost 225 years. We feel we know her, we feel we have seen her before, and that we can relate to her. If you visit Paris, keep an eye out for Marianne.  If you know what to look for, you will no doubt spot her. Here she is at Place de Nation in Paris, and it is a strong image of history and inspiration.

The Gulf of Guinea is the northeasternmost part of the tropical Atlantic Ocean between Cape Lopez in Gabon, north and west to Cape Three Points in Western region Ghana. The Niger River in particular deposited organic sediments out to sea over millions of years which became crude oil. The Gulf, along with the Congo River delta and Angola further south, are expected to provide around a quarter of the United States' oil imports by 2015. This region is now regarded as one of the world's top oil and gas exploration hotspots. The name Guinea has been in use both in the Maghrib and in Europe long before Prince Henry's time. The modern application of the name Guinea to the coast dates only from 1481. In that year the Portuguese built a fort, São Jorge da Mina (modern day Elmina), on the Gold Coast region, and their king, John II, was permitted by the Pope to style himself Lord of Guinea, a title that survived until the recent extinction of the monarchy.

Mar Chiquita Lake (Córdoba) or Mar de Ansenuza is an endorheic salt lake in central Argentina. São Tomé and Príncipe is a Portuguese-speaking island nation in the Gulf of Guinea that became independent from Portugal in 1975. Fanta originated as a result of difficulties importing Coca-Cola syrup into Nazi Germany during World War II due to a trade embargo. The drink originated in Nazi Germany under trade embargo for Coca- Coke ingredients in 1940. The name Fanta was the result of a brief brainstorming session, in which one of the salesmen, Joe Knipp, exhorted his team to ""Fanta"" (Fasie in German), which means ""fantastic"" or ""frivolous"" in English. The Elobeys are two small islands belonging to Equatorial Guinea, located about 140 km apart and about 250 and, respectively, off the northwestern coast of Gabon. The lake was formerly home to a growing tourism industry, and was the site of the Gran Hotel Vienna, a luxurious, lakefront establishment which functioned from 1945 to 1980, and has been the center of numerous mysteries and controversies. It is fed primarily by the saline waters of the Dulce River, coming from Santiago del Estero in the north after being joined by the Saladillo River. From the southwest the lake receives the flow of the Primero/Suquía and the Segundo/Xanaes rivers, as well as several streams; these inflows vary greatly from dry to rainy seasons. The salinity of Mar Chiquitas is quite variable, with measured extremes ranging from 250 g/l in times of low water levels to around 40 g/L in very humid years, such as in the decade following 1977, when record rainfall flooded much of Miramar, Cárdoba. It ranges between 2000 and 6000 km² (1242 and 3728 mi²) The lake is slowly diminishing in volume due to increased evaporation and elevation of its bottom, and is ultimately bound to turn into a salt flat. There are several islands in the lake, the most important one being the Médano Island, and it is located in parts of five departments in the two provinces of Córdova and Santiago delEstero. The largest of the naturally occurring saline lakes in Argentina. Fanta was the second drink to be produced by Coca-Cola, after the original. There are over 90 different flavors worldwide.

Answer:
","Passage:
Lily Munster
Lily Munster, Countess of Shroudshire (née Dracula), is a fictional character in the CBS sitcom, The Munsters, originally played by Yvonne De Carlo.  The matriarch of the Munster household, Lily is a vampire. The role was later played by Lee Meriwether in The Munsters Today and by Portia de Rossi in Mockingbird Lane.

In the original unaired color pilot her name was Phoebe Munster.

Origins

Lily was born in 1827 to Sam Dracula (Grandpa) and his 166th wife (referred to only as ""Grandma""). She lived with Grandpa for some time in Transylvania (a region in Romania) before meeting Herman Munster and marrying him in 1865. She, Grandpa, and Herman moved to America sometime before the mid-1940s and adopted her sister's child, Marilyn. In the mid-1950s, she gave birth to Eddie, her and Herman's only child.

Her name is presumably derived from the tradition of the lily as a flower of death, or a vague reference to Lilith, a female demon of Jewish mythology.

Description

Lily is the matriarch of the Munster family. She is very close with her niece, Marilyn. She has a werewolf for a brother, who appears in one episode, and a sister who is mentioned a few times who is Marilyn's mother. Lily is the voice of reason in the Munster household, often relied upon to set problems right, and typically mediates when Herman and Grandpa squabble.

Lily also has a fiery temper. While she is deeply in love with Herman (""Pussycat,"" as she calls him), she also frequently gets very angry at him (due to his frequent stupidity and occasional selfishness), and Herman often meekly discloses his fear (to others) of being on the receiving end of her wrath. She also has reprimanded her own father (Grandpa) on several occasions for his own foolish actions and stubborn self-righteousness.

Lily treats her niece Marilyn as her own daughter, but shares the family's concern that Marilyn's ""hideousness"" is going to condemn her to a spinster's life. As such, she is very much in favor of Marilyn dating, and is very accommodating to Marilyn's fleeting beaus despite their ""rudeness."" (What Lily is perceiving as lack of manners is in fact the young man's terror of seeing Marilyn's monstrous relatives).

Lily is very supportive of her son, Eddie, and keeps a close eye on his activities and social circle.

Lily is mainly a housewife, and her duties include spreading garbage around the mansion and ""dusting"" with a vacuum cleaner operating in reverse so that it blows dirt about in the nine-room-and-a-dungeon house. During the course of the series, Lily works as a welder in a shipyard, a fashion model, and a palm reader in a tea room. In one episode she forces Herman to give her money so that she and Marilyn can open a beauty parlor, but this soon goes out of business, as Lily assumes her clientele wants to look more like her. These part-time jobs never seem to stick, and Lily would be back to being a homemaker by the next episode.

Lily is a beautiful and slender woman who appears to be in her middle age years, although she is actually hundreds of years old.  Later incarnations of the character, played by different actresses, would change her skin from green to pale white. A white streak in her hair recalls the monster's mate from Bride of Frankenstein. Lily usually dresses in an ankle-length pale pink gown that appears faded and old, and she sometimes also wears a scarf. Her necklace features a bat-shaped medallion. When away from the Munster house, she sometimes wears a long silver cape with a hood. In the episode ""Munsters Masquerade"", Lily demonstrates the ability to float in the air while dancing.

True to her vampire nature, when Lily sleeps she resembles a corpse: ramrod straight and fingers cradled on her chest, even holding a lily (flower) between her fingers. However, like her father, she casts a reflection, sleeps at night and has no problems going out in the daylight (although she wears her heavy cape and hood), despite the two being vampires. She also never is shown to be craving blood or attempting to bite a mortal, like Grandpa occasionally does.

Development

Lily was not in the original pilot episode of The Munsters. Instead, Herman is married to a much more Gothic-looking wife named Phoebe, played by Joan Marshall. The producers scrapped the Phoebe character after deciding she seemed almost an exact double of the Morticia Addams character on The Addams Family. Lily appeared in the second pilot and all other episodes. In the pilot, the Phoebe character was depicted as more goth in nature, and also has a somewhat abrasive bickering relationship with Herman and a strained relationship with Eddie, both elements toned down with Lily.

Yvonne De Carlo was cast for the role in March 1964. When first cast, Gwynne and Lewis went to the producers and complained because De Carlo was a movie star of long standing and they were worried that she would not fit in. However, after a few shows, they had to admit they had been wrong, and all got on well.

Notes

* Note A:  Her age at the beginning of Season 1. This does not take into account the fact that she is undead, and thus has some unknown date of death.

We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us Gypsys, tramps, and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down
Picked up a boy just south of

Rode with us to Memphis
And papa woulda shot him if he knew what he'd done

I never had schoolin' but he taught me well
With his smooth southern style
Three months later I'm a gal in trouble
And I haven't seen him for a while, uh-huh I haven't seen him for a while, uh-huh

Biography
One of the linchpins of the British rock & roll revival of the 1970s and '80s, Shakin' Stevens ranks among the most persistent performers ever to emerge, ultimately, as a superstar. Stevens has no less than 30 U.K. Top 40 hits to his name, almost all of them racked up during a five-year span of chart invincibility. Yet his recording career pre-dated his first hit by over a decade, struggling through a period that might have forced any less committed artist to simply abandon all hope.  ""Shaky"" was born Michael Barratt on March 4, 1948 in Ely, Wales. The youngest of 11 children and a keen amateur singer, he was already married and working as a milkman when he formed Shakin' Stevens & the Sunsets, his first professional band, in 1968. The bandmembers themselves had been playing together in one form or another since the late '50s (when they formed as the Backbeats), and knew Stevens as one of their most devoted fans; he would often join them on-stage to perform a guest vocal or two. With a ferocious live following around South Wales, the band signed to Parlophone in 1970 and recorded its debut album, the optimistically titled A Legend, with producer Dave Edmunds. Reports that they also opened for the Rolling Stones in December 1969 appear to be exaggerated, but the band gigged regularly around Germany and Holland, and scored several European hit singles.  Still, they seemed doomed to haunt the rock & roll revival circuit, all the more so after Stevens was cast in impresario Jack Good's musical Elvis in 1977 (he appeared as the Army-era King), and the band was forced into hiatus for the duration of the play's six-month run. Worse was to come (for the group), however, as Elvis went on to become one of the year's biggest musicals. Stevens' run was extended to two years, and exploding media attention made it clear that Shaky would not be returning to South Wales anytime soon. Stevens quit the Sunsets in late 1979 and, as a solo performer, was signed briefly to Track Records. However, three singles and the Play Loud LP were lost when the label went bankrupt and, while Stevens quickly bounced back, signing to CBS in 1980. His first attempt at recording an album for the label ended with rejection.  A role in Jack Good's reborn Oh Boy TV series kept Stevens at the forefront, however, and the CBS subsidiary Epic picked him up. Three singles flopped, but in February 1980 Stevens finally scored his first U.K. hit when a version of Buck Owens' ""Hot Dog"" reached number 24. ""Marie Marie,"" a Top 20 hit, arrived that summer, and the following February, Stevens enjoyed his first U.K. chart-topper, ""This Ole House."" The follow-up, ""You Drive Me Crazy,"" reached number two, before ""Green Door"" returned him to the top. Thereafter, the hits flew thick and fast; further chart-toppers ""Oh Julie"" (1982) and ""Merry Christmas Everyone"" (1985) sandwiched such smashes as ""Shirley,"" ""Give Me Your Heart Tonight,"" ""I'll Be Satisfied,"" ""Blue Christmas,"" ""Cry Just a Little Bit,"" and many more.   A 1985 reunion with the Sunsets' first producer, Dave Edmunds, resulted in the Lipstick Powder & Paint LP (Edmunds also handled the Christmas number one), while Stevens' other albums included the Top Three successes This Ole House and Shaky (both 1981) and Give Me Your Heart Tonight (1982). There was even chart action for his early-'70s work with the Sunsets, gathered up on the 1981 compilation Shakin' Stevens. Litigation relating to this material would pursue Stevens through the remainder of the   80s and into the '90s, as his former bandmates battled over unpaid royalties. The hits grew smaller as the '80s progressed; his final U.K. Top Five entry was a revival of ""What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For"" in 1987; other singles struggled to even approach the peaks Shaky had once dominated, and in 1993, Stevens retired from recording and performing. His final hit, the previous year's ""Radio,"" was recorded with Queen's Roger Taylor and reached number 37.  Stevens remained in retirement for six years. He was back on the live circuit in 1999, and in 2005 he returned to the U.K. chart with the hits compilation The Collection. That same year he appeared on, and won, the U.K. pop oldies reality TV show Hit Me Baby One More Time -- his victorious song, a cover of P!nk's ""Trouble,"" brought him a Top 20 hit that summer, and paved the way for his first new album in 15 years, 2007's Now Listen. The following year saw Stevens celebrate his 60th birthday with a string of major concerts around the U.K. and Europe, including an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival. Another celebratory tour followed in 2011 when Stevens launched his 30th anniversary celebration and released a new album, Rockin' the Blues. Returning in 2016 with his 20th studio album, Stevens took inspiration from his own ancestral background for the much darker and Americana-influenced Echoes of Our Times. ~ Dave Thompson

Passage:
Lord of Mann
The title Lord of Mann () is used on the Isle of Man to refer to the island's Lord Proprietor   and head of state. The current holder of the title is Queen Elizabeth II.

Relationship with the Crown

The title is not correctly used on its own. Since 1399, the Kings and Lords of Mann existed in a position of feudality as vassals of the reigning King of England, and subsequently of Great Britain and the United Kingdom, who was the ultimate sovereign of the island. This right of 'Lord Proprietor' was revested into the Crown by the Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765 and hence ceased to exist separately. King George III became the first British monarch to rule the Isle of Man as 'Lord of Mann' in 1765.  However, for reasons of culture and tradition, the title Lord of Mann continues to be used. For these reasons, the correct formal usage, as used on the Isle of Man for the Loyal Toast, is The Queen, Lord of Mann.

The title is now Lord of Mann regardless of gender. However, during her reign, Queen Victoria was styled as Lady of Mann. 

The formal Latin style is .

List of Lords

Prior to 1504, the ruler of the Isle of Man was generally styled King of Mann. 

16th century

*Thomas, Earl of Derby, 1504–1521
*Edward, Earl of Derby, 1521–1572
*Henry, Earl of Derby, 1572–1593
*Ferdinando, Earl of Derby, 1593–1594

Succession dispute (1594–1607)

In 1598, a succession dispute between the daughters of Ferdinando and their uncle, William, Earl of Derby was heard. It was decided by the Privy Council that the right to the Isle of Man belonged solely to Queen Elizabeth I, and the letters-patent of 1405 which have conferred the Isle of Man to the Stanley family were declared null and void as the previous ruler, Henry, Earl of Northumberland, had not been subject to legal attainder, despite his treason, and the 1405 and 1406 letters-patent had therefore not taken effect.  

The Queen, in consideration of the ""many eminent services performed to herself and to her royal predecessors by the honourable and noble House of Stanley"", withdrew her right and referred the contending claimants to the decision of the Privy Council as to the best claim of inheritance.

The Law Lords on the Privy Council decided ""the grant being by letters patent under the Great Seal of England, such right would descend according to the Common Law of England to the heirs general, and not to the heirs male"", and the island was therefore awarded to Ferdinando's daughters; whereupon William agreed to purchase their several shares and interests. 

The original letters-patent having been declared void, the Parliament of England in 1609 under James I passed a Private Act of Parliament entitled ""An Act for assuring and establishing the Isle of Man in the name and blood of William, Earl of Derby"" [(1609) 7 Jac.1 c.4]  which established the title in law as Lord of Mann. The lordship was conferred by letters-patent dated 7 July 1609 upon William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby.  Subsequent succession was under the terms of this grant. 

Interim Lords (1607–1609)

Following the resolution of the succession dispute, it was ruled that the daughters of Ferdinando Stanley were the rightful heirs. As the oldest of them would not reach the age of majority until 1609, two temporary Lords of Mann were appointed by James I, using letters patent,  so that the daughters could benefit from the Island's revenues.
*Henry, Earl of Northampton, 1607–1608
*Robert, Earl of Salisbury, 1608–1609

Following the coming of age of the heirs to the Lordship of the Isle of Man, the rights over the island were sold to their uncle, William Stanley. He took up the title of Lord of Mann following the passing of an Act of Parliament. 

17th century

*William, Earl of Derby, 1609–1612
*Elizabeth, Countess of Derby, 1612–1627
*James, Earl of Derby, 1627–1651 (known as 'the Great Stanley')
*Thomas, Lord Fairfax of Cameron, 1651–1660 (appointed by Oliver Cromwell during the English Interregnum)
*Charles, Earl of Derby, 1660–1672 (restored by Charles II)
*William, Earl of Derby, 1672–1702
*James, Earl of Derby, 1702–1736
*James, Duke of Atholl, 1736–1764
*Charlotte, Duchess of Atholl and John, Duke of Atholl,  1764–1765

Revestment

In 1765, Charlotte Murray, Duchess of Atholl, 8th Baroness Strange, sold the suzerainty of the island to the British government for £70,000 and an annuity of £2,000 (£5,235,000 and £150,000 respectively in modern terms). By the passage of the Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765 the title of Lord of Mann was revested into the British Crown. It has therefore since been used on the Isle of Man to refer to the reigning Monarch of the United Kingdom.

All remaining rights and property of the Dukes of Atholl on the island were sold to the British government in 1828 for the sum of £417,144 (over £20,000,000 in modern terms).  
This was accomplished by two Private Acts of Parliament:

* ""An Act empowering the Lords of the Treasury to Purchase all the Manorial Rights of the Duke of Atholl in the Isle of Man"" [c. 34] 10 June 1824
* ""An Act to empower the Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury to purchase a certain Annuity in respect of Duties and Customs levied in the Isle of Man, and any reserved sovereign rights in the said Island belonging to John Duke of Atholl"" [c. 34] 10 June 1825
Question:
Who currently holds the title of Lord of Mann ?
Answer:
Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

Sunday Bloody Sunday (film)
Sunday Bloody Sunday is a 1971 British drama film written by Penelope Gilliatt, directed by John Schlesinger and starring Murray Head, Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch. It tells the story of a free-spirited young bisexual artist (played by Head) and his simultaneous relationships with a female recruitment consultant (Jackson) and a male Jewish doctor (Finch).

The film is significant for its time in that Finch's homosexual character is depicted as successful and relatively well-adjusted, and not particularly upset by his sexuality. In this sense, Sunday Bloody Sunday was a considerable departure from Schlesinger's previous film Midnight Cowboy, which had portrayed its gay characters as alienated and self-loathing, as well as other gay-themed films of the era, including Boys in the Band, and Some of My Best Friends Are....

The film was released before the 1972 shooting by the British Army of unarmed protesters in Derry, Northern Ireland, an event dubbed ""Bloody Sunday.""

Synopsis

Set in London, a middle-aged Jewish doctor, Daniel Hirsh (Peter Finch), and a young woman in her mid-30s, Alex Greville (Glenda Jackson) are both involved in a love triangle with contemporary sculptor Bob Elkin (Murray Head), a younger man in his mid-20s. Not only are Hirsh and Greville both aware that Elkin is seeing the other but they know one another through common friends. Despite this, they are willing to put up with the situation through fear of losing Elkin, who switches freely between them.

For Greville, the relationship is bound up with a growing disillusionment about her professional life, failed marriage and uneasy childhood. For Hirsh, it represents an escape from the repressed nature of his Jewish upbringing. Both realise the lack of permanence about their situation and it is only when Elkin decides to leave the country to settle in New York City after receiving an offer to open his own art gallery to display and sell his artwork, that they both come face to face (for the first time in the narrative at the end). Despite their opposed situations, both Hirsh and Greville come to realize that it is time to move on and Elkin leaves for the USA.

Production notes

* Alan Bates was the original choice made by John Schlesinger for the role of Daniel Hirsh, the gay doctor. However he was held up filming The Go-Between (1970) and was replaced first by Ian Bannen, who dropped out after two weeks' filming, and later by Peter Finch. However, the role of Daniel was written as that of a much younger man.
* Several actresses (including Dame Edith Evans and Thora Hird) politely refused the part of Glenda Jackson's mother, Mrs. Greville, because they thought the project was too risqué. Peggy Ashcroft accepted after the director explained to her the elements of the story and she gladly signed on.
* Ian Bannen was fired from the role of Daniel Hirsh shortly after filming began. Apparently, he was so nervous about what kissing another actor on screen might do to his career, he could not concentrate enough to even get going with the part. He later said that losing the role set back his career, and regretted it till his death.
* Actor Daniel Day-Lewis made his film debut at the age of 14 in this film as a vandal in an uncredited role. He described the experience as ""heaven"", for getting paid £2 to vandalize expensive cars parked outside his local church.

Music

The film makes extensive use of source music including a recurring motif of the trio Soave sia il vento from Mozart's opera Così fan tutte.

Reception

The film currently holds a 91% 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. 

This film appeared on both Roger Ebert's and Gene Siskel's Top 10 list of 1971. Listed as No. 5 and No. 6 respectively. Roger Ebert commented, ""The official East Coast line on John Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday was that it is civilized. That judgment was enlisted to carry the critical defense of the movie; and, indeed, how can the decent critic be against a civilized movie about civilized people? My notion, all the same, is that Sunday Bloody Sunday is about people who suffer from psychic amputation, not civility, and that this film is not an affirmation but a tragedy...I think 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' is a masterpiece, but I don't think it's about what everybody else seems to think it's about. This is not a movie about the loss of love, but about its absence.""

Awards and nominations

Sunday Bloody Sunday was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Actor (Peter Finch), Best Actress (Glenda Jackson), Best Director (John Schlesinger), and Best Original Screenplay (Penelope Gilliatt). Gilliatt won several Best Screenplay awards for the film, including the New York Film Critics Circle Award, Writers Guild of America, and Writers' Guild of Great Britain.

It won the BAFTA Award for Best Film. It also won acting honors for Finch and Jackson, as well as Best Director for Schlesinger.

Passage:
Gunn & Moore
Gunn & Moore, commonly shortened to GM, is a sports equipment and apparel company founded in 1885 based in Colwick, Nottinghamshire, England that specialises in cricket. It became part of the UNICORN GROUP in 1968. 

Overview

Gunn & Moore was founded in 1885 by English Test batsman William Gunn and local businessman Thomas James Moore,  and is most recognised for manufacturing cricket bats. 

The company was originally based at 49 Carrington Street in Nottingham. 

The company also manufactures clothing and a full range of other cricket equipment.

Michael Fagan incident
Michael Fagan (born 8 August 1948) is an intruder who broke into Buckingham Palace and entered Queen Elizabeth II's bedroom in 1982.  The incident was one of the 20th century's worst royal security breaches. 

Biography

Beginnings

Michael Fagan was born in Clerkenwell, London, on 8 August 1948, the son of Ivy and Michael Fagan, who was a steel erector and a ""champion safe-breaker"". He had two younger sisters, Margaret and Elizabeth. In 1955, he attended Compton Street School in Clerkenwell (now St. Peter & St. Paul RC Primary School). In 1966, he left home at 16 to escape his father, who, Fagan says, was violent, and started working as a painter and decorator. In 1972, he married Christine, with whom he had four children. 

Break-ins

First entry

According to his own account, the 9 July 1982 incident was Michael Fagan's second attempted intrusion on the palace; the first happening about a month before.   Fagan says he shimmied up the drainpipe, startling a housemaid, who called security. When guards reached the scene, Fagan had disappeared, leading them to believe the housemaid was mistaken. Fagan claims he entered the palace through an unlocked window on the roof and spent the next half-hour eating cheddar cheese and crackers and wandering around. He tripped several alarms, but they were faulty. He claims to have viewed royal portraits and rested for a while on the throne. He also speaks of entering the postroom, where Diana, Princess of Wales had hidden presents for her first son, William. Fagan said he drank half a bottle of white wine before becoming tired and leaving.

Second entry

At the time of the second incident, 9 July 1982, Michael Fagan was 33 years old and an unemployed decorator whose wife had just left him. At around 7:00am on that morning Fagan scaled Buckingham Palace's 14 ft perimeter wall – topped with revolving spikes and barbed wire – and shimmied up a drainpipe before wandering into the Queen's bedroom at about 7:15am.

An alarm sensor had detected his prior movements inside the palace but police thought the alarm was faulty and silenced it. Fagan wandered the palace corridors for several minutes before reaching the section where the royal apartments were located. In an anteroom Fagan broke a glass ashtray, cutting his hand. He was still carrying a fragment of the glass when he entered the Queen's bedroom.

The Queen woke when he disturbed a curtain, and initial reports said Fagan sat on the edge of her bed. But in a 2012 interview, he said she left the room immediately to seek security. She had phoned the palace switchboard twice for police but none had arrived. Fagan then asked for some cigarettes, which were brought by a maid, who had been cleaning a neighbouring room. The duty footman, Paul Whybrew, who had been walking the Queen's dogs, then appeared, followed by two policemen on palace duty who removed Fagan. The incident had happened as the armed police officer outside the royal bedroom came off duty before his replacement arrived.

A subsequent police report was critical of the competence of officers on duty as well as a system of confused and divided command.

Arrest

Since it was then a civil wrong rather than a criminal offence, Fagan was not charged for trespassing in the Queen's bedroom.  He was charged with theft (of the wine), but the charges were dropped when he was committed for psychiatric evaluation. He spent the next six months in a psychiatric hospital before being released on 21 January 1983. It was not until 2007, when Buckingham Palace became a ""designated site"" for the purposes of section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, that what he did became criminal.  Fagan's mother later said, ""He thinks so much of the Queen. I can imagine him just wanting to simply talk and say hello and discuss his problems."" 

Later life

In 1984, Fagan attacked a policeman at a café in Fishguard, Wales, and was given a three-month suspended jail sentence. He was found guilty of indecent exposure in 1987 after he was spotted running around wearing no trousers on waste ground in Chingford, London. In 1997, he was imprisoned for four years after he, his wife and their 20-year-old son were charged with conspiring to supply heroin. 

Notoriety

In 1983, Michael Fagan recorded a cover version of the Sex Pistols song ""God Save The Queen""  with British punk band the Bollock Brothers. He made an appearance in Channel 4's The Antics Roadshow,  an hour-long 2011 TV documentary directed by the British street artist Banksy charting the history of people behaving oddly in public. The palace intrusion was adapted in 2012 for an episode of Sky Arts' Playhouse Presents series entitled Walking the Dogs,   a one-off British comedy drama starring Emma Thompson as the monarch.

Who did Michael Fagan famously wake up in London in July 1982?

Psychological Reasons for Terrorism SRA-21l, Threat of Terrorism and Crime Penn State Altoona David Barnes Stockholm Syndrome Psychological response found in some victims Hostages become dependent on their captors, and come to identify, sympathize and support their captors Named for a 1973 botched bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden, in which the hostages emerged from the situation very supportive of their captors Can Psychology Help with Terrorism? Expressive view Terrorists are motivated largely by psychological reasons.  They react without much thought Instrumental view Acts of terrorism are deliberate, rational and guided by a calculated plan Expressive View Terrorism is a result of psychological issues Terrorists rationalize acts that they were psychologically compelled to commit anyway Terrorists are polarized.   They are righteous freedom fighters; we are evil Terrorists Are Not Abnormal? Studies of the IRA found no evidence of psychological abnormalities Terrorists who actually enjoy killing and violence tend to be unimportant figures within terrorist organizations and are followers rather than leaders     Comparative studies of different terrorist groups do not show a particular psychological type or uniform terrorist mind Splitting/Externalization A borderline personality disorder in which the individual ascribes all that is good to himself and projects or externalizes all that is bad to others     Splitting seems to be represented disproportionally among terrorists Family Background Come from broken homes Lost a father prior to age 14 Severe conflicts with their parents Convicted in juvenile courts A pattern of life long failure Other Psychological Factors Often not actually members of the societies they purport to commit their acts for     Seldom a well though out program, usually an expressive outburst  Chosen trauma-violent political behavior is the result of some selected historical experience that triggers a disproportionally violent reaction Temptation versus Intimidation Psychiatric Typology of Terrorism Crusaders commit terrorist acts to please God or the people they represent.  They will not negotiate Criminals commit terrorism for personal gain.  They are rational and will negotiate   Crazies commit terrorist acts because they are mad.  Note that crazy does not mean stupid Instrumental View Opposite of the expressive view Terrorism is a logical strategy based upon rational cost-benefit analysis  Terrorists are usually normal people pursing a rational, deliberate strategy Instrumental View of Psychology Psychological aspects of terrorist's behavior are important when analyzing the group's influence on individual behavior, but emphasizing psychological aspects is not helpful because there are too many reasons why people become terrorists Instead, consider the reasons for terrorism Situations in places where terrorism exists Reasons for terrorism Role of the individual terrorists Situation-Preconditions Enabling causes of terrorism Poverty Society prone to violence Technology such as bombs Urbanization-densely populated areas make attacks easier and more effective Social habits and historical conditions such as Pakistan Precipitants Reasons for terrorism, or what provides motivation and direction of terrorists If the police or army attacked a family member, that might motivate terrorists Black Friday in Iran in which the Shah's troops started shooting at people is widely considered to be a classical precipitant Seven Terrorist Motives Publicize the cause Disrupt establishment's normal function Create public sympathy Provoke a harsh response from the government Add cohesion, boost morale of the group Counter the government's greater military power Capitalize on unique historical opportunities Role of the Individual Instrumental view doesn't focus on psychological issues, but it also doesn't ignore them Things can be learned from individual terrorist's psychological makeup Common psychological characteristics are studied Attributes Common to Terrorists High tolerance to risk Heavy reliance on the group Vengeance for jailed or killed comrades Sense of guilt used to justify their actions Dedication to a political belief or cause More Common Attributes Willingness to self sacrifice Suppress normal emotions Reasonably high intelligence Education Access to resources

List of Presidents of the United States with facial hair
The majority of men who have held the office of President of the United States have been clean shaven, including the Founding Fathers.   Between 1861 and 1913, however, all but two presidents wore either beards or mustaches during their tenure in office. 

John Quincy Adams (1825–29) was the first U.S. President to have notable facial hair, with long sideburns.   But the first major departure from the tradition of smooth-faced chief executives was Abraham Lincoln (1861–65),    who was supposedly (and famously) influenced by 11-year-old Grace Bedell to start growing a beard shortly before he was elected.    After Lincoln, all but two presidents over the next 50 years sported facial hair, the exceptions being Andrew Johnson (1865–69) and William McKinley (1897–1901).   

The most recent president to have facial hair was William Howard Taft (1909–1913), who wore a mustache.       The last major party candidate to wear a beard was Charles Evans Hughes, who was defeated in 1916.   The last major party candidate for President to have facial hair was Thomas E. Dewey, who had a mustache, in 1944 and 1948.    Some pundits even claimed that public disapproval of Dewey's mustache may have contributed to his two electoral defeats.    

Social scientists have researched the effect of facial hair on the electability of Presidential candidates, and currently consider facial hair to have a negative effect on candidates.    Today, the existence of facial hair on potential presidential candidates is regularly noted (albeit somewhat jokingly) as a harmful factor.  

Following is a list of American presidents who had facial hair at any time during their tenure.

Passage:
Schick test
The Schick test, invented between 1910 and 1911  is a test used to determine whether or not a person is susceptible to diphtheria.   It was named after its inventor, Béla Schick (1877–1967), a Hungarian-born American pediatrician.

The test is a simple procedure.  A small amount (0.1 ml) of diluted (1/50 MLD) diphtheria toxin is injected intradermally into one arm of the person and a heat inactivated toxin on the other as a control.  If a person does not have enough antibodies to fight it off, the skin around the injection will become red and swollen, indicating a positive result.  This swelling disappears after a few days.  If the person has an immunity, then little or no swelling and redness will occur, indicating a negative result.

Results can be interpreted as: 
# Positive: when the test results in a wheal of 5–10 mm diameter, reaching its peak in 4–7 days. The control arm shows no reaction. This indicates that the subject lacks antibodies against the toxin and hence is susceptible to the disease.
# Pseudo-positive: when there is only a red colored inflammation (erythema)and it disappears within 4 days. This happens on both the arms since the subject is immune but hypersensitive to the toxin.
# Negative reaction: Indicates that the person is immune
# Combined reaction: Initial picture is like that of the pseudo-reaction but the erythema fades off after 4 days only in the control arm. It progresses on the test arm to a typical positive. The subject is interpreted to be both susceptible and hypersensitive.

The test was created when immunizing agents were scarce and not very safe, however as newer and safer toxoids were made available there was no more requirement for susceptibility tests.

A Schick test is a skin test for previously acquired immunity to which disease?

Passage:
Spectator sport
A spectator sport is a sport that is characterized by the presence of spectators, or watchers, at its matches. For instance, American football, association football, baseball, basketball, professional boxing, cricket, field hockey, Formula One, ice hockey, rugby football, team handball, tennis and volleyball are spectator sports, while hunting or underwater hockey typically are not. Spectator sports may be professional sports or amateur sports. They often are distinguished from participant sports, which are more recreational; golf and tennis can be either. Association football, also known as soccer, is by far the most watched sport on the planet.

The increasing broadcasting of sports events, along with media reporting can affect the number of people attending sports due to the ability to experience the sport without the need to physically attend and sometimes an increasingly enhanced experience including highlights, replays, commentary, statistics and analysis. Some sports are particularly known as ""armchair sports"" or ""lounge room sports"" due to the quality of the broadcasting experience in comparison to the live experience.

Spectator sports have built their own set of culture and traditions including, in the United States, cheerleading and pre-game and half time entertainment such as fireworks, particularly for big games such as competition decider events and international tests. The passion of some sports fans also means that there are occasionally spectator incidents.

Notable spectator sports events where events regularly sell out well in advance and are broadcast to large audiences include the FIFA World Cup, Olympic Games, UEFA European Football Championship, Cricket World Cup, Commonwealth Games, The Ashes, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, Heineken Cup, Indian Premier League, Six Nations Championship, FA Cup, Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Fußball-Bundesliga, Australian Football League, Super League, Rugby League Challenge Cup, Grand Slam tennis, World Series Baseball, Rugby World Cup, Kentucky Derby, Melbourne Cup, PGA Tour, National Rugby League, All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, MLS, Wimbledon, Formula One, and NASCAR.

The North American Society for Sport Management (NASSM) devotes much of their annual conference to research addressing the psychology behind a desire to view spectator sports, and how it might be leveraged to increase demand. Much of the research focuses on exploiting a need for vicarious achievement, and a desire within the spectator to project a public image through a declaration of team allegiance.

Separation of the active and the passive, the line between sport and spectator, gives rise to the paradox of the spectator—described by French philosopher Jacques Rancière; which is to seek an opportunity to passively contemplate engaging in an activity, and in doing so, forfeit that life moment one might have used to actually engage in the activity.

China's Game Console Ban Lifted: How Will PS4, Xbox One ...
China's Game Console Ban Lifted: How Will PS4, Xbox One Make Money with So Much Piracy in the Country? : US News : Latin Post
Share This Tweet This
This week China's government has lifted a 14-year old ban on devices. These devices included game consoles like our popular Xboxes , PlayStations and Wii devices. You see, in China, the government believed that these video games created a ""negative effect on the mental health of its youth ."" Guess they changed their minds because as of now, China welcomes the popular game consoles Americans know so well.
Just because the Chinese government had such a ban on our generation did not mean that the consoles and games were not being sold illegally or ""bootlegged.""  This is where Microsoft, SONY and Nintendo will find a problem in sales. Yes, the ban is off, but kids are probably going to continue buying games for $1.65 from their usual bootlegger, instead of the $60 an average game goes for.
Zhang Yang has sold Xboxes, Wiis and PlayStations at his Beijing shop for as long as the devices have been available. ""The consoles that Zhang sells are smuggled into China, modified or 'cracked' to play pirated games,"" which has kept his shop up and running. Another problem that games corporation face are that Chinese gamers have became accustomed to playing free games on their PCs and mobiles through out the years. You cannot miss something you have never had.

""Console vendors will need to incorporate a business model for a piracy-rich environment,"" said Lisa Hanson, a  U.S. based Managing Director at Niko Partners , a research firm focused on Asian games market. ""They need to understand who the gamers are, what they demand, what are they not getting out of the current PC game experience that they could from a console game,"" Hanson added.
So while it is easy to sell Call of Duty to kids anywhere else in the world, a very carefully thought out marketing plan must teach Chinese kids how to appreciate the game. Something to also think about is how to convince parents in China to purchase the consoles and games for their ""positive shield minded"" kids. Have you seen that episode of South Park where Cartman organizes an entire Black Friday troop filled with betrayal and lies in order to get their hands on a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One? (Hilarious, by the way).  Yeah... That's how obsessed gamers can really get.

Were post-Olympics Britain to vote for a head girl, it would be a fair bet that the honour would fall to Clare Balding . If it's not shocking to learn from the first volume of her endearing autobiography that she has form as a boarding school prefect, there are also little surprises embedded in the sports broadcaster's account of her early life. The daughter of a racehorse trainer, she measures out her life in ponies, boxers and lurchers, but even those who find the sporting life a distasteful mulch of dog slaver, moult and mucking out will find it hard to resist stories of the young Balding bowling into her house in filthy jodhpurs to find the Queen eating breakfast, or the Mean Girls atmosphere of boarding school pranks. Balding's love of animals is warmly expressed, a striking contrast to her rancour-free insights into a certain kind of English family, one who considered a brisk wave to be a public display of affection and who might easily forget to pick up their daughter for her first school holiday. As this biography underlines, however, she has turned out rather well.

Passage:
Safety pin
The safety pin is a variation of the regular pin which includes a simple spring mechanism and a clasp.  The clasp serves two purposes: to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin to whatever it is applied to, and to cover the end of the pin to protect the user from the sharp point.

Safety pins are commonly used to fasten pieces of fabric or clothing together. Safety pins, or more usually a special version with an extra safe cover, called a nappy pin are widely used to fasten cloth diapers (nappies), as the safety clasp prevents the baby from being jabbed. Similarly, they can be used to patch torn or damaged clothing. Safety pins can also be used as an accessory in jewelry, like earrings, chains, and wristbands. Sometimes they are used to attach an embroidered patch. Size 3 is often used in  quilting and may be labelled for purchase as a ""quilting pin"". Size 4 and larger may be called ""blanket pins"" and deemed acceptable as  kilt pins for informal dress, depending upon design and appearance.

Early precursor

The fibula, a form of brooch, was invented by the Myceaneans on the Greek Peloponnesus between the 14th and 13th Century BC, and is considered an early precursor to a safety pin since they were used in a similar manner. However, it had a major flaw. It had no clasp or spring at the end to help put it in place. Over the centuries, the fibula became forgotten. 

Invention of the safety pin

American mechanic Walter Hunt is regarded as the inventor of the safety pin that bears resemblance to those used today. The safety pin included a clasp that covered the point and kept it from opening, and a circular twist at the bend to act as a spring and hold it in place.   Charles Rowley (Birmingham, England) independently patented a similar safety pin in October 1849,  although the company no longer makes these.

Needing to settle a $15 debt with a friend, Hunt one day decided to invent something new in order to pay off his friend. He used a piece of brass wire that was about 8 inches long and made a coil in the center of the wire so it would open up when released. The clasp at one end was devised in order to shield the sharp edge from the user. 

After being issued U.S. patent #6,281 on April 10, 1849,  Hunt sold the patent to W. R. Grace and Company  for $400 (roughly $10,000 in 2008 dollars). Using that money, Hunt then paid the $15 owed to a friend and kept the remaining amount of $385 for himself. What Hunt failed to realize is that in the years to follow, W.R. Grace and Company would make millions of dollars in profits from his invention. 

Locking safety pin 
 
This  has a special sliding cap over the top of the clasp to hold the pin more securely in place.

Nappy pin 
 
Whilst the cover on the safety pin makes it less likely to hurt someone, a version was invented specially for use with babies' nappies, the nappy pin.  This is larger and stronger than the typical safety pin. Modern nappy pins have the sliding cap to lock the pin.

Medical aspects

The laryngologist Dr. Chevalier Jackson devised special instruments for removing swallowed safety pins. Because small children often swallowed them and open pins could be lodged dangerously in their throats, Jackson called them ""danger pins"" and sometimes displayed arrangements of those he had extracted. Safety pin ingestion is still a common problem in some countries, including Turkey, today. 

Culture

During the emergence of punk rock in the late seventies, safety pins became associated with the genre, its followers and fashion.  Some claim the look was taken originally from Richard Hell whom the British punks saw in pictures, and whose style they adopted.  This is disputed by a number of artists from the first wave of British punks, most notably Johnny Rotten, who insists that safety pins were originally incorporated for more practical reasons, for example, to remedy ""the arse of your pants falling out"". British punk fans, after seeing the clothing worn by such punk forerunners, then incorporated safety pins into their own wardrobe as clothing decoration or as piercings, shifting the purpose of the pins from practicality to fashion. The safety pin subsequently has become an image associated with punk rock by media and pop-culture outlets.

Diagram of the Human Body Using Etymologies
July 11, 2013
The origin of a word is fascinating, and the etymology of a word’s evolution tells a story.  You can almost picture syllables and letters marching like armies through distant lands – Old England, Low Germany, Ancient Greece… or rising up from a dark, primordial world of shapeless magic to take form and structure.
I’ve changed the anatomic names of the human body on this diagram to tell the story of each organ’s epithet. As a primary source I used Online Etymology Dictionary , which is a labor of love created by Douglas Harper using the best classic sources. The fantastic 3D anatomy rendering is from Zygote Media Group . I found some of the derivations and etymologies quite thought-provoking, while others such as “knee” are simply stated. I had to do a lot of work with my “something broken” to compose this diagram, so please enjoy!
Brain – from the Celtic bhrag-no, or bran, “something broken”
Skull – Dutch schol “turf, piece of ice”
Hair – from PIE ghers– “to stand out, to bristle, rise to a point”
Eye – from Proto-Indo-European (from here on abbreviated as PIE) “to see”
Ear (Pinna) – from the Proto-Indo-European “backbone, dorsal fin”
Cheek – Old English ceowan “chew”
Nose – PIE nas, “nose”
Mouth – Old English muþ “mouth, opening, door, gate,”

Heart – Old English heorte “heart; breast, soul, spirit, will, desire; courage; mind, intellect”
Aorta – Greek aorte, term applied by Aristotle, literally “what is hung up,”
Lungs – Proto-Germanic lungw, “the light organ.” It is speculated that this derives from the fact that lungs of a slaughtered animal float in water, while the heart, liver, etc., do not.
Esophagus – from Greek oisophagos “gullet,” literally “what carries and eats”
Stomach – Latin stomachus “stomach, throat,” also “pride, inclination, indignation”
Liver – PIE leip– “to stick adhere; fat”
Gallbladder – from PIE root ghel– “gold, yellow, yellowish-green” and PIE bhle– “to blow”, “to blow yellow, green”
Pancreas – Latinized form of Greek pankreas, from pan– “all” (see pan-) + kreas “flesh”
Kidney – perhaps a compound of Old English cwið “womb” + ey “egg”
Intestines – Old English hropp, literally “rope”
Spleen – from Greek splen, associated with “violent, ill-temper”
Ovary – classical Latin, ovarius, “egg-keeper”
Uterus – PIE root udero, “sticking out”
Vagina – PIE wag-ina – from root *wag- “to break, split, bite”
Penis – from Latin penis, “tail”
Thigh – PIE teuk– from root teu – “to swell”
Quadriceps – Latin quadriceps, “having four parts”
Leg – PIE root meaning “to bend”
Knee – well, basically Latin genu “knee”
Calf – Old English cealf – “young cow”

Hand – Old English hond, hand “hand; side; power, control, possession”
Finger – PIE penkwe, the root meaning “five”

Common buzzard
The common buzzard (Buteo buteo) is a medium-to-large bird of prey whose range covers most of Europe and extends into Asia. Over much of its range, it is resident year-round, but birds from the colder parts of the northern hemisphere typically migrate south (some well into the southern hemisphere) for the northern winter.

Description

The common buzzard measures between 40 and in length with a 109 - wingspan and a body mass of 427 -, making it a medium-sized raptor.

This broad-winged raptor has a wide variety of plumages, and in Europe can be confused with the similar rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus) and the only distantly related European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), which mimics the common buzzard's plumage for a degree of protection from northern goshawks. The plumage can vary in Britain from almost pure white to black, but is usually shades of brown, with a pale 'necklace' of feathers.

Systematics

The common buzzard was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Falco buteo. Buteo is the Latin name for this species.81

Buzzard subspecies fall into two groups.
The western Buteo group is mainly resident or short-distance migrants. They are:
* Buteo buteo buteo: most of Europe
* B. b. rothschildi: Azores
* B. b. insularum: Canary Islands
* B. b. pojana: Corsica and Sardinia
* B. b. menetriesi: Caucasus
* B. b. harterti: Madeira, doubtfully distinct from nominate buteo

The eastern vulpinus group includes
* B. b. vulpinus (steppe buzzard): Eurasia: migrant breeder

Behaviour

The common buzzard breeds in woodlands, usually on the fringes, but favours hunting over open land. It eats mainly small mammals, and will come to carrion. A great opportunist, it adapts well to a varied diet of pheasant, rabbit, other small mammals to medium mammals, snakes and lizards, and can often be seen walking over recently ploughed fields looking for worms and insects.

Buzzards do not normally form flocks, but several may be seen together on migration or in good habitat. The Victorian writer on Dartmoor, William Crossing, noted he had on occasions seen flocks of 15 or more at some places. Though a rare occurrence, as many as 20 buzzards can be spotted in one field area, approximately 30 m apart, so cannot be classed as a flock in the general sense, consisting of birds without a mate or territory. They are fiercely territorial, and, though rare, fights do break out if one strays onto another pair's territory, but dominant displays of aggression will normally see off the interloper. Pairs mate for life. To attract a mate (or impress his existing mate) the male performs a ritual aerial display before the beginning of spring. This spectacular display is known as 'the roller coaster'. He will rise high up in the sky, to turn and plummet downward, in a spiral, twisting and turning as he comes down. He then rises immediately upward to repeat the exercise.

The call is a plaintive peea-ay, similar to a cat's meow.

Status

In parts of its range it is increasing in numbers. In Ireland it became extinct about 1910, but began to slowly recolonise the country in the 1950s, and is now a common and familiar sight over much of Ireland.

Steppe buzzard

The steppe buzzard, B. (b.) vulpinus breeds from east Europe eastward to the Far East, excluding Japan. It is a long-distance migrant, excepting some north Himalayan birds, and winters in Africa, India and southeastern Asia. In the open country favoured on the wintering grounds, steppe buzzards are often seen perched on roadside telephone poles.

The steppe buzzard is some times split off as a separate species, B. vulpinus. Compared to the nominate form, it is slightly smaller (45 – long), longer winged and longer tailed. There are two colour morphs: the rufous form which gives this subspecies its scientific name (vulpes is Latin for ""fox""), and a dark grey form.

The tail of vulpinus is paler than the nominate form, and often quite rufous, recalling North American red-tailed hawk. The upper wings have pale primary patches, and the primary flight feathers are also paler when viewed from below. Adults have a black trailing edge to the wings, and both morphs often have plain underparts, lacking the breast band frequently seen in B. b. buteo.

Lily was born in 1827 to Sam Dracula (Grandpa) and his 166th wife (referred to only as ""Grandma""). She lived with Grandpa for some time in Transylvania (a region in Romania) before meeting Herman Munster and marrying him in 1865. She, Grandpa, and Herman moved to America sometime before the mid-1940s and adopted her sister's child, Marilyn. Lily is the voice of reason in the Munster household, often relied upon to set problems right, and typically mediates when Herman and Grandpa squabble. She has a werewolf for a brother, who appears in one episode, and a sister who is mentioned a few times who is Marilyn's mother. In one episode she forces Herman to give her money so that she and Marilyn can open a beauty parlor, but this soon goes out of business. Lily usually dresses in an ankle-length pale pink gown that appears faded and old, and she sometimes also wears a scarf. Her necklace features a bat-shaped medallion. In the episode ""Munsters Masquerade"", Lily demonstrates the ability to float in air while dancing. When she sleeps she resembles a corpse: ramrodled on her chest, even with her fingers cradled between her fingers. However, like her father, she has no problems going out at night and sleeps at daylight, although she wears a heavy cape and hood despite the two being vampires. She also has a fiery temper, and frequently gets very angry at him (due to his frequent stupidity and occasional selfishness), and Herman often meekly discloses his fear (to others) of being on the receiving end of her wrath. Lily treats her niece Marilyn as her own daughter, but shares the family's concern that Marilyn's ""hideousness"" is going to condemn her to a spinster's life. As such, she is very much in favor of Marilyn dating, and is very accommodating to Marilyn's fleeting beaus despite their ""rudeness."" (What Lily is perceiving as lack of manners is in fact the young man's terror of seeing Marilyn's monstrous relatives). Lily is very supportive of her son, Eddie, and keeps a close eye on his activities and social circle. ""When You Walk in the Room"" is a song written and recorded by Jackie DeShannon. It was first released by her in 1963 but covered by many artists. Lily Munster was not in the original pilot episode of The Munsters. The producers scrapped the Phoebe character after deciding she seemed almost an exact double of the Morticia Addams character on The Addams Family. Lily appeared in the second pilot and all other episodes of the show. The lyrics of the song attempt to detail the singer's emotions when in the presence of the person he or she loves. The song was recorded by The Searchers in 1964, and became an international hit. Another early hit, ""Needles and Pins"", written by Jack Nitzche and a little known at the time songwriter from Detroit by the name of Sonny Bono, was covered by the Searchers also. In 1994, country music artist Pam Tillis recorded a version for her 1994 album Sweetheart's Dance. Tillis' version was released as a single, reaching a peak of #2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts. The single was not as successful as ""If I Thought You'd Ever Change"", peaking at No 11 in Sweden and a No 34 in the UK, where it remained in the chart for two weeks. It has been remixed by Almighty and The Young Veins, among other artists, for their album My Colouring Book, her first album in 17 years, which was released in 2004. The cover has been covered by several artists, including Billy Kramer, J.J. Cale, Paul Carrack, Stephanie Winslow, Biff Watson, and Bérénice Beauregard, among others, for various compilation albums and compilations, such as ""The Best of Bééry Beauren"" and ""Béréce Beaurnard and The Best Of Bérer & The Best of Me"" The song has been played on the soundtrack of the film The Godfather: Part II, and the film's soundtrack has been used for the film version of ""The Godfather"" as well as on the TV series ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" and the TV movie ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the Planet of the Apes"", among other things. The music video was directed by Dick Clark, and depicts Tillis in a mid-1960s appearance on American Bandstand. Shakin' Stevens is one of the most persistent performers ever to emerge. He has no less than 30 U.K. Top 40 hits to his name, almost all of them racked up during a five-year span of chart invincibility. His recording career pre-dated his first hit by over a decade, struggling through a period that might have forced any less committed artist to simply abandon all hope. Stevens was cast in Jack Good's musical Elvis in 1977 (he appeared as the Army-era King) and went on to become the group's biggest-ever run. He died in 2008 at the age of 69. He is survived by his wife, three children, and two step-daughters. He also has a son, a daughter, and a son-in-law, all of whom are still living in the U.S. and play in his band, the Backbeats. Stevens is also survived by a daughter and a step-daughter, both of whom play in the band, Elisa's. He had a son and a daughter with singer-songwriter Chris Hillman, who died in 2010. He was also the father of singer-actor-songwriters Paul Carrack and David Walliams. Stevens has also recorded with several other artists, including DJ Ötzi & The Bellamy Brothers, Ray Dylan, and The Olsen Brothers. His last album, A Legend, was released in 2012. It was released by Parophone, a record label based in London, England. It is available on CD, vinyl, and digital download. The album is out now and is available for pre-order on Amazon.com, CDBaby, iTunes, and other major retailers. The single ""Gypsies, Tramps And Thieves"" was released on September 14, 2013. The song was written by Stevens and his band mates, The Dakotas, and was recorded by The Ventures, The Searchers, The Challengers, The Ventures and others. The band members have been playing together in one form or another since the late '50s (when they formed as the Back Beats), and knew Stevens as one of their most devoted fans; he would often join them on-stage to a guest vocal. The group has since recorded a number of albums, including ""The Searchers"" and ""Smokie"" in 2000 and ""Glass Tiger"" in 1999 and ""A Legend"" in 1998. The track ""When You Walk In The Room"""" was a hit for which group in 1964?"" is from which group? The Ventures – 1965. Bruce Springsteen (live version) - 1977. Stevens quit the Sunsets in late 1979 and, as a solo performer, was signed briefly to Track Records. In February 1980 Stevens finally scored his first U.K. hit when a version of Buck Owens' ""Hot Dog"" reached number 24. Thereafter, the hits flew thick and fast; further chart-toppers ""Oh Julie"" and ""Merry Christmas Everyone"" sandwiched such smashes as ""Shirley,"" ""Give Me Your Heart Tonight,"" ""I'll Be Satisfied,"" ""Blue Christmas,"" ""Cry Just a Little Bit,"" and many more. The title Lord of Mann is used on the Isle of Man to refer to the island's Lord Proprietor   and head of state. The current holder of the title is Queen Elizabeth II.ould not be returning to South Wales anytime soon. Back in 2016 with his 20th studio album, Stevens took inspiration from his own ancestral background for the much darker and Americana-influenced Echoes of Our Times. The following year saw Stevens celebrate his 60th birthday with a string of major concerts around the U.S. and Europe, including an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival. Another celebratory tour followed in 2011 when Stevens launched his 30th anniversary celebration and released a new album, Rockin' the Blues. That same year he appeared on, and won, the UK pop oldies reality TV show Hit Me Baby One More Time -- his victorious song, a cover of P!nk's ""Trouble,"" brought him a Top 20 hit that summer, and paved the way for his first new album in 15 years, 2007's Now Listen. The final hit, the previous year's ""Radio,"" was recorded with Queen's Roger Taylor and reached number 37. In 2005 he returned to the UK chart with the hits compilation The Collection. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from. Back To the page where you camefrom. Back into the page that you came From.    Stevens' other albums included the Top Three successes This Ole House and Shaky (both 1981) and Give Me Your heart Tonight (1982). There was even chart action for his early-'70s work with the Sunset, gathered up on the 1981 compilation Shakin' Stevens. The last U.k.

During the course of this article, we will attempt to determine whether or not the subject of the question is a male or a female. The question is whether the subject is a man or a woman. We will use the question to determine the gender of the person at the centre of the debate. We hope to find out if the question was asked by the male or the female, and if the answer was yes or no, we can use the answer to determine if the subject was a man, a woman or a combination of the two. We can also use this question to discover if the female was a woman, a girl, or a mixture of both, and whether the male and the female were at the center of the dispute. We are going to use the term ""crisis"" to refer to the fact that we are trying to find the reason why the subject may have been affected by the change in the question. We also want to know if the topic was a male, a female, or both, or if it was the same person at all. We want to see if we can find the cause and effect relationship between the question and the answer, and find out what the result would be if we were to ask the question again and again. The answer is that the subject, the male, the female and the question were all at the same place at the beginning and the end of the discussion. The result will be published in the next issue of the book, ""Crisis: The Crisis: The Story of the Crisis, published by Simon & Schuster, is published on July 25, 2014.

He spent the next half-hour eating cheddar cheese and crackers and wandering around. He tripped several alarms, but they were faulty. He claims to have viewed royal portraits and rested for a while on the throne. He also speaks of entering the postroom, where Diana, Princess of Wales had hidden presents for her first son, William. Fagan said he drank half a bottle of white wine before becoming tired and leaving. The incident had happened as the armed police officer outside the royal bedroom came off duty before his replacement arrived. The palace intrusion was adapted in 2012 for an episode of Sky Arts' Playhouse Presents series entitled Walking the Dogs,   a one-off British comedy drama starring Emma Thompson as the monarch. In 1983, Michael Fagan recorded a cover version of the Sex Pistols song ""God Save The Queen"" with British punk band the Bollock Brothers.

In 1984, Fagan attacked a policeman at a café in Fishguard, Wales, and was given a three-month suspended jail sentence. He was found guilty of indecent exposure in 1987 after he was spotted running around wearing no trousers on waste ground in Chingford, London. In 1997, he was imprisoned for four years after he, his wife and their 20-year-old son were charged with conspiring to supply heroin. In 2007, when Buckingham Palace became a ""designated site"" for the purposes of section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, that what he did became criminal.   Fagan's mother later said, ""He thinks so much of the Queen. I can imagine him just wanting to simply talk and say hello and discuss his problems.""   He was charged with theft (of the wine), but the charges were dropped when he was committed for psychiatric evaluation.  He spent six months in a psychiatric hospital before being released on 21 January 1983. He has since had a successful career as a decorator. Psychological Reasons for Terrorism SRA-21l, Threat of Terrorism and Crime Penn State Altoona David Barnes Stockholm Syndrome Psychological response found in some victims. Named for a 1973 botched bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden, in which the hostages emerged from the situation very supportive of their captors Can Psychology Help with Terrorism? Expressive view Terrorists are motivated largely by psychological reasons. Instrumental view Acts of terrorism are deliberate, rational and guided by a calculated plan. Opposite of the expressive view Terrorism is a logical strategy based upon rational cost-benefit analysis. Instead, consider the reasons for terrorism Situations in places where terrorism exists Reasons for terrorism Role of the individual terrorists Situation-Preconditions Enabling causes of terrorism Poverty Society prone to violence Technology such as bombs Urbanization-densely populated areas make attacks easier and more effective Social habits and historical conditions such as Pakistan Precipitants Reasons forterrorism, or what provides motivation and direction of terrorists.    What can be learned from individual terrorist's psychological   The answer is not to focus on psychological issues, but it also doesn't ignore them. It is important to look at the group's influence on individual behavior, but emphasizing psychological aspects is not helpful because there are too many reasons why people become terrorists. If the police or army attacked a family member, that might motivate terrorists. Black Friday in Iran in which Shah's troops started shooting at people is widely considered to be a classical precipitant. Seven Terrorist Motives Publicize the cause Disrupt establishment's normal function Create public sympathy Provoke a harsh response from the government Add cohesion, boost morale of the group. Counter the government's greater military power Capitalize on unique historical opportunities.  The solution to terrorism is to make it more difficult for people to commit acts of terrorism. StudyBlue is an app that studies psychological characteristics of terrorists. Terrorists tend to have high tolerance to risk, reliance on the group, and a sense of guilt. The last major party candidate to wear a beard was Charles Evans Hughes, who was defeated in 1916. Thomas E. Dewey, who had a mustache, was defeated two times in 1944 and 1948. Social scientists have researched the effect of facial hair on the electability of Presidential candidates, and currently consider facial hair to have a negative effect on candidates. John Quincy Adams was the first U.S. President to have notable facial hair, with long sideburns. After Lincoln, all but two presidents over the next 50 years sported facial hair. The most recent president to have facial hair was William Howard Taft (1909–1913), who wore a mustache. The Schick test, invented between 1910 and 1911, is a test used to determine whether or not a person is susceptible to diphtheria. It was named after its inventor, Béla Schick (1877–1967), a Hungarian-born American pediatrician. If a person does not have enough antibodies to fight it off, the skin around the injection will become red and swollen, indicating a positive result. If the person has an immunity, then little or no swelling and red or no redness will occur, which can be interpreted as a negative result. The test is a simple procedure. A small amount (0.1 ml) of diluted (1/50 MLD) dphtheria toxin is injected intradermally into one arm of the person and a heat inactivated toxin on the other as a control. Results can occur, in wheal, when the test results in:# Positive: when the person's skin swells and red and redness disappears days after the injection.# Negative: when there is no swelling or redness after a few days, indicating that the person is not immune to the toxin and that the injection caused by the injection did not work.   The test can also occur, when no red or red swelling and no red/swollen skin occurs, which is interpreted as negative. It can occur when the skin does not respond to the injection for several days after it is given. A Schick test is a skin test for previously acquired immunity to which disease. The test was created when immunizing agents were scarce and not very safe, however as newer and safer toxoids were made available there was no more requirement for susceptibility tests.

The North American Society for Sport Management (NASSM) devotes much of their annual conference to research addressing the psychology behind a desire to view spectator sports. Much of the research focuses on exploiting a need for vicarious achievement, and a desire within the spectator to project a public image through a declaration of team allegiance. The line between sport and spectator, gives rise to the paradox of the spectator, described by French philosopher Jacques Rancière; which is to seek an opportunity to passively contemplate engaging in an activity, and in doing so, forfeit that life moment one might have used to actually engage in the activity. The word 'passage' is used to produce three new words to produce more 'fort' and 'over' to produce a new word to produce the new word 'assassination' The word is also used to indicate one particular decade of a class or type, as of a manufactured item, as opposed to an individual one.

The safety pin is a variation of the regular pin which includes a simple spring mechanism and a clasp. The clasp serves two purposes: to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin to whatever it is applied to, and to protect the user from the sharp point. Safety pins, or more usually a special version with an extra safe cover, called a nappy pin are widely used to fasten cloth diapers (nappies), as the safety clasp prevents the baby from being jabbed. They can also be used as an accessory in jewelry, like earrings, chains, and wristbands. Safety pin ingestion is still a common problem in some countries, including Turkey, Turkey, and the UK. Some claim the emergence of safety pins became associated with the genre, punk rock in the late seventies, but this is disputed by the British punks whom they saw in pictures and whose style they adopted.

The common buzzard (Buteo buteo) is a medium-to-large bird of prey. Its range covers most of Europe and extends into Asia. It measures between 40 and in length with a 109 - wingspan and a body mass of 427 -. It eats mainly small mammals, and will come to carrion.Buzzards do not normally form flocks, but several may be seen together on migration or in good habitat. They are fiercely territorial, and, though rare, fights do break out if one strays onto another pair's territory. To attract a mate (or impress his existing mate) the male performs a ritual aerial display before the beginning of spring. The call is a plaintive peea-ay, similar to a cat's meow. In parts of its range it is increasing in numbers. In Ireland it became extinct about 1910, but began to slowly recolonise the country in the 1950s, and is now common and familiar over much of Ireland. There are two morphs: the rufous form which gives this species a longer, longer, tailed form, and the nominate form which is slightly shorter and tailed. Compared to the nominate, the steppe buzzard is slightly smaller (45 – 45mm) and longer winged and is favoured on the open country on the wintering grounds in India and southeastern Asia. The nominate form is split off as a separate species, B. vulpinus, which is sometimes seen perched on roadside telephone poles. The steppe Buzzard breeds from east Europe eastward the Far East, excluding Japan, excepting some north and winters and winters in Africa, India and South Africa. It is a sight over the Himalayan mountains and is a long-distance migrant, except in some north-east African countries, such as Kenya and the Republic of Ireland, where it is more common. It can be found in the UK in the south-east of England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Northern France, Scotland and northern England. It has a wide variety of plumages, and in Europe can be confused with the similar rough-legged buzzard and the only distantly related European honey buzzard, which mimics its plumage for a degree of protection from northern goshawks. The male buzzard performs a spectacular aerial display known as 'the roller coaster' before the start of spring to attract his mate.

Fine pretty much means the end of a piece. In piece you used for your example the end is pretty obvious, but some pieces of music will end in the middle after a D.S. al Fine.
In this example you can see the end of the piece is not where it would usually be. D.S. al Fine itself means go the Segno and play to the Fine. The Fine is used to say where the ending actually is.

Roy Greenslade
Roy Greenslade (born 31 December 1946) is Professor of Journalism at City University London  and has been a media commentator since 1992, most especially for The Guardian. He writes a daily blog on The Guardian media site and wrote a column for the London Evening Standard for ten years from 2006.  

Early life and career

He was educated at Dagenham County High School (1957–63) and, aged 17, was hired by the Barking and Dagenham Advertiser. After serving a three-year indentureship he joined the Lancashire Evening Telegraph in Blackburn as a sub-editor before spending 18 months as a sub at the Manchester office of the Daily Mail.

At The Sun and elsewhere

In 1969, he entered Fleet Street as a news sub on The Sun, which had just been acquired by Rupert Murdoch. He had a brief spell with the Daily Mirror in 1972 before returning to The Sun as deputy chief sub-editor, first with the news desk and later in the features department.

He left The Sun in 1974 to write his first book and to take a degree in politics at the University of Sussex. He worked his way through university with part-time subbing jobs at the Brighton Argus, BBC Radio Brighton, the Sunday Mirror and Reveille. After graduating in 1979, he joined the Daily Star in Manchester for six months until being seconded to the Daily Express in London. He was soon appointed features editor of the Daily Star.

In 1981 he returned to The Sun as assistant editor. He was very involved in the move from Fleet Street to Wapping. Five years later, he transferred to The Sunday Times, first running the Review Section before becoming managing editor (news). In 1990, he was appointed by Robert Maxwell as editor of the Daily Mirror.

While editor of the Daily Mirror, Greenslade was at the centre of a controversy after he rigged a competition in the paper to make sure it was unwinnable.  He admitted his behaviour in October 2011 at a seminar at the Leveson Inquiry: ″On behalf of my proprietor Robert Maxwell I fixed a game offering a million pounds to anyone who could spot the ball and ensured that no-one won. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea culpa.″ 

He departed in March 1991 and later that year was consultant editor for three months to both The Sunday Times and Today.

The Guardian and other outlets

From 1992 until 2005 he was media commentator for The Guardian. He presented BBC Radio 4's Mediumwave (1993–95) and in 1996 was the launch presenter of Britain Talks Back on Granada Talk TV. He has continued to be a regular broadcaster on media matters.

After leaving The Guardian, he then spent three months with The Daily Telegraph in a similar capacity before returning to The Guardian to launch a media blog and began to write a weekly media column for the Evening Standard. His column for what is now the London Evening Standard lasted for ten years until April 2016, but he remains a contributor to the newspaper.  In the context of a changing industry, Greenslade concluded his last column for the London Evening Standard with the observation: ""Whatever happens, this I know:journalism, the trade I have practised for more than 50 years, must survive. Without it, democracy itself is imperilled"".

Other work

He is on the board of the academic quarterly, the British Journalism Review, and is a trustee of the media ethics charity, MediaWise. In 2003, he was appointed Professor of Journalism at City University London in succession to Hugh Stephenson.

Greenslade has been credited with coining the term: ""The Hierarchy of Death"" as well as writing extensively on the subject.  

He is also the author of three books, Goodbye to the Working Class (1976), Maxwell's Fall (1992) and Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits from Propaganda (2003).

Irish republicanism

During the late 1980s, when he was managing news editor of The Sunday Times, he secretly wrote for An Phoblacht, a newspaper published by Sinn Féin.  His pseudonym was 'George King'. This was exposed by Nick Davies, a Guardian colleague and instigator of the journalistic investigation into phone hacking. When Greenslade reviewed Davies's book on his blog in 2008, he did not deny his writings for An Phoblacht.  Greenslade also spoke at a Sinn Féin conference in London on the 30th anniversary of the hunger strikes, and he wrote an article on the same subject for An Phoblacht. He has had a house in County Donegal for many years, and a close personal friend is Pat Doherty, who from 1988 until 2009 was vice president of Sinn Féin, and who has been publicly named as a former member of the IRA Army Council.   He also stood surety for IRA member John Downey, one of the suspects in the 1982 bombing of Hyde Park which killed four soldiers. 

Personal life

He is married to Noreen Taylor, the former Daily Mirror journalist and mother of actress Natascha McElhone.

Passage:
Repeat sign
In music, a repeat sign is a sign that indicates a section should be repeated. If the piece has one repeat sign alone, then that means to repeat from the beginning, and then continue on (or stop, if the sign appears at the end of the piece). A corresponding sign facing the other way indicates where the repeat is to begin. These are similar to the instructions da capo and dal segno.

When a repeat calls for a different ending, numbered brackets above the bars indicate which to play the first time (1), which to play the second time (2), etc. These are called ""first-time bars"" and ""second-time bars,"" or ""first and second endings."" They are also known as ""volta brackets"" and have no limit to how many there can be.

In Unicode

In Unicode, repeat signs are part of the Musical Symbols and are coded as follows:

Other notation

When only standard  keyboard characters are available, the punctuation marks vertical bar and colon are used to represent repeat signs: |: ... :|

In Gregorian chant, a repeat is indicated by a Roman numeral following a section. This is common particularly in a Kyrie, where the lines followed by ""iii"" are to be repeated three times (corresponding to the correct liturgical form).

In shape-note singing, repeat signs usually have four dots, between each line of the staff. The corresponding sign to show where the repeat is from is either the same sign reversed (if it is at the beginning of a bar), or the dots themselves (if it is in the middle of a bar). First and second endings are given with just the numbers above the corresponding bars. Repeats notated at the beginning of a verse, or given with multiple lines of text per verse, are generally required; the repeats given for most songs of the final few lines are optional, and almost always used only for the final verse sung.

What would you do if you found the instruction 'Da Capo' on a piece of music?

Passage:
White Nile
The White Nile ( ') is a river of Africa, one of the two main tributaries of the Nile, the other being the Blue Nile. In the strict meaning, ""White Nile"" refers to the river formed at Lake No at the confluence of the Bahr al Jabal and Bahr el Ghazal Rivers.

In the wider sense, the term White Nile refers to the rivers draining from Lake Victoria into the White Nile proper (Victoria Nile, Kyoga Nile, Albert Nile, Bahr-al-Jabal). It may also, depending on the speaker, refer also to the headwaters of Lake Victoria (about  from the most remote sources down to Khartoum)

The 19th century search by Europeans for the source of the Nile was mainly focused on the White Nile, which disappeared into the depths of what was then known as 'Darkest Africa'. The White Nile's true source was not discovered until 1937, when the German explorer Burkhart Waldecker traced it to a stream in Rutovu at the base of Mount Kikizi.

When in flood the Sobat River tributary carries a large amount of sediment, adding greatly to the White Nile's color. 

Headwaters of Lake Victoria 

The Kagera River, which flows into Lake Victoria near the Tanzanian town of Bukoba, is the longest feeder river for Lake Victoria, although sources do not agree on which is the longest tributary of the Kagera and hence the most distant source of the Nile itself. 

The source of the Nile can be considered to be either the Ruvyironza, which emerges in Bururi Province, Burundi,  near Bukirasaz or the Nyabarongo, which flows from Nyungwe Forest in Rwanda.  The two feeder rivers meet near Rusumo Falls on the Rwanda-Tanzania border.

The falls are notable because of an event on 28–29 April 1994, when 250,000 Rwandans crossed the bridge at Rusumo Falls into Ngara, Tanzania in 24 hours, in what the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees called ""the largest and fastest refugee exodus in modern times"". The Kagera forms part of the Rwanda–Tanzania and Tanzania–Uganda borders before flowing into Lake Victoria.

In Uganda 

The river arising from Lake Victoria is known as the Victoria Nile. The place where it arises, just outside Jinja, is marked by a monument. After Nalubaale Power Station and Kiira Power Station at the mouth, the river goes through Bujagali Falls (location of Bujagali Power Station) about 15 kilometres downstream from Jinja.

It then flows north and westwards through Uganda, feeding into Lake Kyoga in the centre of the country and then out west. At Karuma Falls, the river sweeps under Karuma Bridge () at the southeastern corner of Murchison Falls National Park.

During much of the insurgency of the Lord's Resistance Army, Karuma Bridge, built in 1963 to help the cotton industry, was the key stop on the way to Gulu, where vehicles would gather in convoy before being provided with a military escort for the final run north. In 2009, the Government of Uganda announced plans to construct a 750-MW hydropower project several kilometres north of the bridge, which is scheduled for completion in 2016. 

The World Bank had approved to fund a smaller 200-MW power plant, but Uganda opted for a bigger project, which the Ugandans will fund internally, if necessary. 

Just before entering Lake Albert, the river is compressed into a passage seven metres in width at Murchison Falls, marking the entry into the western branch of the East African Rift. The river flows into Lake Albert opposite the Blue Mountains in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The river exiting Lake Albert to the north is known as the Albert Nile. It separates the West Nile sub-region of Uganda from the rest of the country. A bridge passes over the Albert Nile near its inlet in Nebbi District, but no other bridge over this section has been built. A powered ferry connects the roads between Adjumani and Moyo: navigation of the river is otherwise done by small boat or canoe.

The Mountain Nile  

The Albert Nile continues north to Nimule, where it enters South Sudan and becomes known as the Mountain Nile or Baḥr al-Jabal   (also Baḥr el-Jebel, ), literally ""Mountain River"" or ""River of the Mountain"". Bahr al Jabal also formerly lent its name to the state of Central Equatoria.

The Bahr al-Jabal then winds through rapids before entering the Sudan plain and the vast swamp of the Sudd. It makes its way to Lake No, where it merges with the Bahr el Ghazal and there forms the White Nile. An anabranch river called Bahr el Zeraf flows out of the Bahr al-Jabal at and flows through the Sudd, to eventually join the White Nile.

The Bahr al-Jabal passes through Juba, the capital of South Sudan, which is the southernmost navigable point on the Nile river system, and then to Kodok, the site of the 1898 Fashoda Incident that marked an end to the Scramble for Africa.

The river flows north into Sudan and lends its name to the Sudanese state of White Nile, before merging with the larger Blue Nile at Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, and forming the River Nile.
Question:
In which country does the White Nile leave Lake Victoria?
Answer:
Ugandese
Passage:
Army of Republika Srpska
The Army of Republika Srpska (); Serbian, Bosnian, Croatian Vojska Republike Srpske (VRS)), also referred to as the Bosnian Serb Army, was the military of the Republika Srpska, an area which was previously the ""Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina"", a self-proclaimed state within the internationally recognized territory of the sovereign Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In 2003 the army began to integrate into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2005 a fully integrated unit of Serbs, Bosniaks, and Croats was deployed to augment the US-led coalition forces in Iraq. On 6 June 2006, it was fully integrated into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  

History 

The Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) was founded on 12 May 1992 from the remnants of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from which Bosnia and Herzegovina had seceded the same year. When the Bosnian War erupted, the JNA formally discharged 80,000 Bosnian Serb troops. These troops, who were allowed to keep their heavy weapons, formed the backbone of the newly formed Army of the Republika Srpska.  Aside from being made up almost entirely of Serb Orthodox officers and recruits from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the VRS also utilized the services of approximately 4,000 foreign Orthodox Christian volunteers to participate in combat operations during the Bosnian War. 1,000-1,500 of these came from Russia, and Bulgaria,  with 700 volunteers originating from Russia specifically.  100 Greeks also volunteered to fight on the side of the Bosnian Serbs, forming the Greek Volunteer Guard which allegedly participated in the Srebrenica massacre. 

The military leader of the VRS was General Ratko Mladić, who is now indicted at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for genocide, as are other high-ranking Serb officers.  Mladić was arrested in Serbia on 26 May 2011.

Passage:
Banana Island
Banana Island, is an artificial island off the foreshore of Ikoyi, Lagos.

Architectural history

The original Banana Island construction project entitled Lagoon City was the brainchild of the Late Chief Adebayo Adeleke, a University of London trained Civil Engineer (MICE), and CEO of City Property Development Ltd.

Chief Adebayo Adeleke had originally commissioned a new urban development in Maroko, Victoria Island, but that project had been 'acquired' by the Lagos State government with no financial consideration paid. Following a lengthy 10 year court case, Lagos State government offered other parcels of land as consideration for the Maroko development.

Many scoffed at Chief Adeleke's decision to select the Ikoyi Island perimeter, however they were unable to appreciate the foresight of the Chief, who promptly engaged the Westminster Dredging Company to dredge the foreshore, and create six interlinked and symmetrical islands.

He wanted to create a development that would ""Make Nigeria Proud"", and engaged Minoru Yamasaki the architect of Manhattan's Twin Towers, to design replica twin towers as the flagship iconic buildings on the main island.

To complete the Lagoon City concept, Chief Adeleke planned an aesthetic design including a City Airport, which was a vision conceived long before the London Docklands Development, London City Airport, Dubai's Palm Islands or Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport.

Unfortunately for the Chief, as soon as he had reclaimed the land and the brilliance of the idea was unveiled, others were determined to wrestle the land from him, and the project was 'acquired' again with no consideration being paid to City Property Development Limited. The 'acquisition' is currently being challenged in various courts, and there are Caveat Emptor warnings in place to warn prospective buyers that their investment could be at risk in future. There is also litigation pending in the UK and European courts regarding this matter.

The subsequent developers were principally interested in maximising the yield of the land at the expense of the aesthetic innovative design foreseen by Chief Adebayo Adeleke. Consequently, the land was filled in to create a banana shaped island, which has resolutely failed to achieve any international iconic architectural acclaim, as it is now a residential scheme rather than the commercial development originally envisaged.

Banana Island, is an area of Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria, 8.6 kilometres east of Tafawa Balewa Square. Part of the Lagos Local Government Area of Eti-Osa in Central Lagos, it is known for its wealthy, multi-cultural community and has some of the most expensive real estate in Nigeria.  Banana Island has one of the highest density of millionaires within its boundaries. 

Design

Banana Island is a man-made island in Lagos State, Nigeria that is slightly curved in shape – like a banana.  It is located in the Lagos Lagoon and is connected to Ikoyi Island by a dedicated road which is linked to the existing road network near Parkview Estate.  The island was constructed by the Lebanese-Nigerian Chagoury Group in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing    and is considered to be on par with the Seventh Arrondissement in Paris, La Jolla in San Diego, and Tokyo’s Shibuya and Roppongi neighbourhoods.

It occupies a sand-filled area of approximately 1,630,000 square metres and is divided into 536 plots (of between 1000 and 4000 square metres in size) mainly arranged along cul-de-sacs, so designed to enhance the historically residential nature of Ikoyi. Residents are provided with world class utilities including underground electrical systems (versus the overhead cabling common throughout Lagos), an underground water supply network, a central sewage system and treatment plant, and street lighting and satellite telecommunications networks. 

The Island is a planned, mixed development with dedicated areas for residential, commercial and recreational activities.  On the residential side of the Island, planning permission is not granted for dwellings over 3 storeys high. The developers also intend to develop a main piazza, a club-house, a primary and secondary school, a fire and police station and a medical clinic. They are also negotiating to build a 5-star hotel on the island, along with an array of smaller Guest Houses.

Composition

Banana Island hosts several high end residential developments such as Ocean Parade Towers   - a series of 14 luxury tower blocks strategically situated at one end of the island to take advantage of 180 degree panoramic views overlooking the lagoon. Similar to many of the developments on the island, it has dedicated leisure facilities such as a private health club - with tennis courts, squash courts and a swimming pool surrounded by extensive gardens.   At launch flats in Ocean Parade sold for over US$400,000. 

Several leading Nigerian and International corporates such as - Etisalat Nigeria,  Airtel Nigeria,  Ford Foundation Nigeria  and Olaniwun Ajayi & Co  - are also based on Banana Island.

Notable residents

*Mike Adenuga - Billionaire owner of Globacom - Nigeria’s second-largest telecom operator and oil exploration firm Conoil. 
*Iyabo Obasanjo - Daughter of former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Oluremi Obasanjo, Elected to the Nigerian Senate representing Ogun Central Senatorial District of Ogun State,  Senior Fellow at Harvard's Advanced Leadership Initiative.
*Saayu Dantata - Son of Alhassan Dantata - the wealthiest man in West Africa at the time of his death in 1955.
*Kola Abiola - son of MKO Abiola - prominent businessman, publisher and politician. He is widely regarded as the presumed winner of the 1993 presidential elections.

Passage:
Dili
Dili (Portuguese/Tetum: Díli, Indonesian: Kota Dili) is the capital, largest city, chief port and commercial centre of East Timor.

Geography and administration

Dili lies on the northern coast of Timor island, the easternmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is the seat of the administration of the district of Dili, which is the administrative entity of the area and includes the island of Atauro and some cities close to Dili city. The city is divided into the subdistricts of Nain Feto, Vera Cruz, Dom Aleixo and Cristo Rei and is divided into several sucos, which are headed by an elected chefe de suco. 18 of the 26 sucos of the four subdistricts are categorised as urban. 

There is no city administration beside the district administrator, who was appointed by state government. The East Timorese government started to plan in 2009 to change the status of districts into municipalities. These will have an elected mayor and council. 

Demography

The 2010 census recorded a population of 193,563 in the areas of Dili district classified as urban, with a population of 234,331 in the whole district including rural areas such as Atauro and Metinaro.

Dili is a melting pot of the different ethnic groups of East Timor, due partly to the internal migration of young men from around the country in search of work.  This has led to a gender imbalance, with the male population significantly larger than the female.  Between 2001 and 2004, the population of Dili district grew by 12.58%, with only 54% of the district's inhabitants born in the city.  7% were born in Bacau, 5% each in Viqueque and Bobonaro  4% in Ermera, and the remainder in other districts or overseas. 

Climate

Dili has a Tropical wet and dry climate under the Köppen climate classification.

History

Dili was settled about 1520 by the Portuguese, who made it the capital of Portuguese Timor in 1769.  It was proclaimed a city in January 1864. During World War II, Portugal and its colonies remained neutral, but the Allies saw East Timor as a potential target for Japanese invasion, and Australian and Dutch forces briefly occupied the island in 1941.  In the night of 19 February 1942, the Japanese attacked with a force of around 20,000 men, and occupied Dili before spreading out across the rest of the colony.  On 26 September 1945, control of the island was officially returned to Portugal by the Japanese.

East Timor unilaterally declared independence from Portugal on 28 November 1975. However, nine days later, on 7 December, Indonesian forces invaded Dili. On 17 July 1976, Indonesia annexed East Timor, which it designated the 27th province of Indonesia, Timor Timur (Indonesian for East Timor), with Dili as its capital. A guerrilla war ensued from 1975 to 1999 between Indonesian and pro-independence forces, during which tens of thousands of East Timorese and some foreign civilians were killed. Media coverage of the 1991 Dili Massacre helped revitalise international support for the East Timorese independence movement.

In 1999, East Timor was placed under UN supervision and on 20 May 2002, Dili became the capital of the newly independent Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. In May 2006, fighting and rioting sparked by conflict between elements of the military caused significant damage to the city and led to foreign military intervention to restore order.

Buildings and monuments

Most buildings were damaged or destroyed in the violence of 1999, orchestrated by the Indonesian military and local pro-Indonesia militias (see Operation Scorched Earth).  However, the city still has many buildings from the Portuguese era. The former Portuguese Governor's office is now the office of the Prime Minister. It was previously also used by the Indonesian-appointed Governor, and by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).

Even under Indonesian rule, during which the Portuguese language was banned, Portuguese street names like Avenida Marechal Carmona remained unchanged, although they were prefixed with the Indonesian word Jalan or 'road'. The Roman Catholic Church at Motael became a focus for resistance to Indonesian occupation. Legacies of Jakarta's occupation are the Church of the Immaculate Conception, seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Díli, purportedly the largest cathedral in Southeast Asia, and the 'Integration Monument', commemorating the Indonesian annexation of the territory in 1976. Featuring a statue of an East Timorese in traditional dress, breaking the chains round his wrists, the monument has not been demolished.

The Cristo Rei of Dili is a 27-metre (88.6 ft) tall statue of Jesus situated on top of a globe at the end of a peninsula in Dili. It is one of the town's landmarks.  It was a present from the Indonesian Government during occupation for the 20th anniversary of East Timor's integration into Indonesia.

Education

Schools in Dili include St. Joseph’s High School (Colégio de São José).
There are four International schools in Dili, a Portuguese school by the name of Escola Portuguesa Ruy Cinatti, an Australian managed school by the name of Dili International School, an American government sponsored school called QSI International School of Dili and the Maharlika International School (Formerly Dili Education & Development Center), a Philippine International School.  East Timor's major higher education institution, the Universidade Nacional de Timor-Leste, is based in Dili.

Transportation

Dili is served by Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport, named after independence leader Nicolau Lobato.  This is the only functioning international airport in East Timor, though there are airstrips in Baucau, Suai and Oecusse used for domestic flights.  Until recently, Dili's airport runway has been unable to accommodate aircraft larger than the Boeing 737 or C-130 Hercules, but in January 2008, the Portuguese charter airline EuroAtlantic Airways operated a direct flight from Lisbon using a Boeing 757, carrying 140 members of the Guarda Nacional Republicana. 

Under Portuguese rule, Baucau Airport, which has a much longer runway, was used for international flights, but following the Indonesian invasion this was taken over by the Indonesian military and closed to civilian traffic.

Personal life

On 1 May 1976, Tomelty married musician Gordon ""Sting"" Sumner – best known as the lead singer and bassist for the rock band The Police – after knowing him for two years. They met on the set of a rock-musical called Rock Nativity.  She played the Virgin Mary; he played in the band. They have two children together, Joseph (born 23 November 1976) and Fuchsia Katherine (""Kate"") (born 17 April 1982). Sumner left Tomelty for his current wife Trudie Styler, and the couple divorced in 1984. The split was controversial; as The Independent reported in 2006, ""The problem was, he was already married – to actress Frances Tomelty, who just happened to be Trudie's best friend (Sting and Frances lived next door to Trudie in Bayswater, west London, for several years before the two of them became lovers). The affair was widely condemned – not least because it coincided with the break-up of the Police.""

Fisher, who was 17 years old at the time, subsequently shot Buttafuoco's wife, Mary Jo Buttafuoco, in the face. Popular news coverage titled Fisher the ""Long Island Lolita.""  Buttafuoco subsequently pleaded guilty to one count of statutory rape and served four months in jail. 

Shooting incident

On May 19, 1992, Amy Fisher shot Mary Jo Buttafuoco in the right side of the face. Fisher had come to the Buttafuocos' house to confront Mary Jo Buttafuoco about Joey Buttafuoco, with whom she had been having an affair since July 1991 after Fisher brought her vehicle to Buttafuoco's auto body shop in Baldwin, Nassau County. When Mary Jo answered the door, Fisher—posing as her own (fictitious) sister Ann Marie—offered as proof of the affair a T-shirt that Joey had given her, with the logo of his auto body shop on it. The front porch confrontation escalated, and when Mary Jo demanded that Fisher leave and turned to go into the house and call Joey, Fisher shot her in the face with a .25 caliber semiautomatic pistol. Once Mary Jo regained consciousness, she identified Fisher as her assailant.

The investigation of the shooting and the subsequent court cases involved a series of conflicting claims, and received significant news coverage in both mainstream news outlets and tabloids.  Buttafuoco's lawyer maintained that Buttafuoco was never involved with Fisher and Fisher had invented the affair, while Fisher's lawyer portrayed Fisher as a victim whom Buttafuoco manipulated into the shooting. 

After Fisher's assault conviction, Buttafuoco was indicted on 19 counts of statutory rape, sodomy, and endangering the welfare of a child. He initially pleaded not guilty.  He later changed his plea to guilty, admitting he had sex with Fisher when she was 16 and that he had known her age at the time.   He was sentenced to six months' jail time, and was released after serving four months and nine days of the sentence. 

After his release from prison, Joey and Mary Jo Buttafuoco moved to California, where Mary Jo filed divorce papers in Ventura County Superior Court on February 3, 2003. 

Unrelated charges

Buttafuoco has been charged with crimes on several occasions since the 1992 shooting incident.

* In 1995, he pleaded no contest to a solicitation of prostitution charge and was fined and placed on probation for two years. 
* In 2004, he was sentenced to a year in jail and five years of probation after pleading guilty to auto insurance fraud. As part of the sentence, he is prohibited from working in the auto body industry in California for the rest of his life. 
* In August 2005, he was charged with illegal possession of ammunition. As a convicted felon, he is legally not permitted to own ammunition. Probation officers found the ammunition during a search of his home. He pleaded no contest and began serving his sentence on January 8, 2007.  He was released on April 28, 2007.

Media appearances

The significant coverage of the shooting incident made Buttafuoco a minor celebrity. During Fisher's trial, Buttafuoco appeared frequently on mainstream and tabloid news programs and talk shows, and gave multiple interviews to all forms of media. David Letterman, in his last year of hosting Late Night with David Letterman, discussed the incident so often that Buttafuoco's name was a recurring punchline,  while Saturday Night Live parodied the case in multiple sketches. 

In 2002, Buttafuoco participated in the Fox Network's Celebrity Boxing, originally slated to oppose John Wayne Bobbitt, who dropped out due to being arrested for domestic abuse. Bobbitt was replaced by female pro wrestler Joanie ""Chyna"" Laurer.  Buttafuoco, despite being booed, won the fight in a majority decision (29–28, 29–27, 28–28).

In 2006, he and Amy Fisher were reunited at the Lingerie Bowl for the coin toss.   In a story reported in the New York Post, reality show producer David Krieff suggested that Buttafuoco and Fisher were then ""dating"" again, although this was not supported by any direct statements from either Buttafuoco or Fisher.  On May 23, 2007, Mary Jo Buttafuocco appeared on CNN's Larry King Live program to discuss the recent reunion of her ex-husband and the former ""Long Island Lolita."" At the time, Buttafuoco's second wife, Evanka, had recently filed for divorce, but withdrew her divorce petition on June 22, 2007. 

Buttafuoco appeared on the Judge Jeanine Pirro show on March 5, 2009. He sued a woman who had attempted to pay for $4,700 in repairs to her Corvette in sexual favors rather than money. Buttafuoco won the case.

In 2012, Buttafuoco appeared on the Fox News program Justice with Judge Jeanine, offering commentary on a murder-for-hire plot.

Buttafuoco appeared on Judge Alex on November 1, 2012. He sued his friend Rob Spallone's company over a dispute regarding the rental of a frozen ice truck for Buttafuoco's nephew's birthday party. Buttafuoco won the case and Spallone was ordered to pay $4,400 in damages.

TV and film career

Buttafuoco made his film debut as a cab driver in Cul-de-Sac (video title: Better Than Ever). He subsequently appeared in The Underground Comedy Movie, Mafia Movie Madness, Skin Walker, Finding Forrester and Operation Repo: The Movie.

Frank Williams (actor)
Frank Williams (born 2 July 1931)  is an English actor best known for playing Timothy Farthing, the vicar in the popular BBC comedy Dad's Army. Following the death of Pamela Cundell in 2015, he and Ian Lavender are the last surviving major cast members. He reprised the role of Farthing in the 2016 film adaptation of the series. 

Biography

Born in London, Williams was educated at Ardingly College, West Sussex and Hendon School (then Hendon County School). He appeared regularly in the TV series The Army Game (1957–60) as Captain Pocket. His film roles include Norman Wisdom films: The Square Peg (1958), The Bulldog Breed (1960), and A Stitch In Time (1963). He had a leading role in the BBC TV series Diary of a Young Man (1964), which was partly directed by Ken Loach, in addition to small parts in numerous popular TV series of the 1950s and 1960s.

It is however for his role in Dad's Army   as Timothy Farthing, that Williams is best known. Coincidentally, while at Hendon County, he had played the lead in the school play of his final year, The Ghost Train, written nearly 30 years earlier by Arnold Ridley, who would become one of his fellow actors in Dad's Army.

In 1970, he starred with Tessie O'Shea in the short-lived sitcom As Good Cooks Go. In 1967 and again in 1971, Williams appeared in an episode of All Gas and Gaiters as one of the vicars choral. In 1972, at the height of his Dad's Army fame, he had a cameo role in Monty Python's Flying Circus. He also had an occasional role as a Bishop in You Rang, M'Lord?.

He lived for many years in Edgware, Middlesex. Until 2000, he was a lay member of the General Synod of the Church of England. Williams was a guest on This Morning on Thursday 31 July 2008, talking about Dad's Army with fellow cast members, Ian Lavender and Bill Pertwee. He also appeared on BBC1's Jonathan Ross Salutes Dad's Army show on Sunday 3 August 2008.  

He is the author of several plays, including The Playing Fields and Murder Weekend, some of which have been performed in the pro-amateur theatre.

Passage:
Eurasian hobby
The Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), or just simply hobby, is a small slim falcon. It belongs to a rather close-knit group of similar falcons often considered a subgenus Hypotriorchis.

Description

Adults are slate-grey above with a dark crown and two short black moustachial stripes. The throat is unstreaked white, thighs and undertail coverts are unstreaked rufous and rest of the underparts are whitish with black streaks. Close views enable the red ""trousers"" and vent to be seen. Sexes are similar. Juveniles are generally much browner, with scaled upper parts and streaked buffy thighs and undertail coverts.

The hobby has a distinct first-summer plumage.

This falcon is  in length with a wingspan of 74 – and a weight of 175 –.

Taxonomy and systematics

This species was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Falco subbuteo.

Currently two subspecies are recognized:

* F. s. subbuteo: the nominate race is resident in Africa, Europe and Central and East Asia, winters in Central and South Africa and South Asia
* F. s. streichi: described by Hartert and Neumann in 1907, is smaller in size and is found further east of F. s. subbuteos distribution range

The genus name falco derives from Late Latin falx, falcis, a sickle, referring to the claws of the bird. The species name subbuteo is from Latin sub, ""near to"" and buteo, "" buzzard"" . The species' English name comes from Old French hobé or hobet. It became the trademark for the Subbuteo games company after its creator was refused permission to register ""Hobby"". 

Distribution and status

This species breeds across Africa, Europe and Asia. It is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa and Asia.

Behaviour and ecology

It is a bird of open country such as farmland, marshes, taiga and savannah. They are widespread in lowlands with scattered small woods. It is an elegant bird of prey, appearing sickle-like in flight with its long pointed wings and square tail, often resembling a swift when gliding with folded wings. It flies powerfully and fast. It will take large insects, such as dragonflies, which it transfers from talons to beak and eats while soaring slowly in circles. It also captures small bats  and small birds like swallows, swifts, pipits etc. in flight. Its speed and aerobatic skills enable it to take swallows and even swifts on the wing, and barn swallows or house martins have a characteristic ""hobby"" alarm call. It is known to harass swallows while they are roosting and dispersing from roosts. When not breeding, it is crepuscular, hawking principally in the mornings and evenings. While on migration, they may move in small groups.

Hobbies nest in old nests of crows and other birds. The tree selected is most often one in a hedge or on the extreme edge of a spinney, whence the bird can observe intruders from a considerable distance. It lays 2–4 eggs. Incubation is said to take 28 days and both parents share in this duty, though the female does the greater part.

It is a very bold and courageous bird and was used in falconry, trained to hawk birds like quails, larks, hoopoes, drongos, etc.

Falco subbuteo is the scientific name for which small falcon?

In Unicode, repeat signs are part of the Musical Symbols and are coded as follows: vertical bar and colon are used to represent repeat signs: |:... :|. In Gregorian chant, a repeat is indicated by a Roman numeral following a section. Repeats notated at the beginning of a verse, or given with multiple lines of text per verse, are generally required. The repeats given for most songs of the final few lines are optional, and almost always used only for the final verse sung. If the piece has one repeat sign alone, then that means to repeat from the beginning, and then continue on (or stop, if the sign appears at the end of the piece). A corresponding sign facing the other way indicates where the repeat is to begin. When a repeat calls for a different ending, numbered brackets above the bars indicate which to play the first time (1), which toplay the second time (2), etc. They are also known as ""volta brackets"" and have no limit to how many there can be. The term White Nile refers to the rivers draining from Lake Victoria into the White Nile proper (Victoria Nile, Kyoga Nile, Albert Nile, Bahr-al-Jabal). It may also, depending on the speaker, refer also to the headwaters of Lake Victoria (about  from the most remote sources down to Khartoum) The White Nile's true source was not discovered until 1937, when the German explorer Burkhartcker traced it to a stream in Mount Kiku at the base of Mount Kiki. When the Sobovat River tributary carries a large amount of sediment, adding greatly to the Nile's color, it is called the 'White Nile' The source of the Nile can be considered to be either the Ruvyironza, which emerges in Bururi Province, Burundi, or the Nyabarongo, which flows from Nyungwe Forest in Rwanda. The two feeder rivers meet near Rusumo Falls on the Rwanda-Tanzania border. 250,000 Rwandans crossed the bridge atRusumo Falls into Ngara, Tanzania in 24 hours, in what the U.N. called ""the largest and fastest refugee exodus in modern times"" The Kagera forms part of the Rwanda–tanzania and Tanzania–Uganda borders before flowing into Lake Victoria. The Albert Nile separates the West Nile sub-region of Uganda from the rest of the country. The Mountain Nile continues north to Nimule, where it enters South Sudan and becomes known as the Mountain Nile or Baḥr al-Jabal. The White Nile flows north into Sudan and lends its name to the state of White Nile, before merging with the Blue Nile at Khartoum and forming the larger Nile River. The Nile River is the southernmost navigable point on the Nile river system and is used by the Ugandans to cross the border to South Sudan. It is also used to travel between Uganda and South Africa to the north and to the south of the continent. The River of the River is a tributary of the Red Nile, which is the longest river in the Nile system. It flows into Lake Albert opposite the Blue Mountains in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It then winds through rapids before entering the Sudan plain and the vast swamp of the Sudd. It makes its way to Lake No. and there it merges with the Bahr el Ghazal and there forms the White Nile. An anabranch river calledBahr el Zeraf flows out of the BahR al-jabal at and flows through the Suddle, to eventually join the Nile. The Red Nile is the largest river in Africa and is the source of much of the water in the Red Sea and Red Sea. The Black Nile is a small river that flows into the Nile from the east. It has been used as a source of water for the Red and Blue Nile since the mid-19th century, but is now largely dried up. It also has a number of tributaries, including the Nile River, which runs through Uganda and into South Africa. The Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) was founded on 12 May 1992 from the remnants of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The military leader of the VRS was General Ratko Mladić, who is now indicted at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for genocide. In 2003 the army began to integrate into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2005 a fully integrated unit of Serbs, Bosniaks, and Croats was deployed to augment the US-led coalition forces in Iraq. On 6 June 2006, the army was fully integrated into the armed forces of the Republic of Bosnia. The VRS also utilized the services of approximately 4,000 foreign Orthodox Christian volunteers to participate in combat operations during the Bosnian War. 1,000-1,500 of these came from Russia, and Bulgaria, with 700 volunteers originating from Russia specifically. 100 Greeks also volunteered to fight on the side of the Bosnia Serbs. The Greek Volunteer Guard allegedly participated in the Srebrenica massacre. The army is now controlled by the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovinas. It is made up almost entirely of Serb Orthodox officers and recruits from Bosnia and Bosnia. It also has a special unit called the Wolves from the Drina, or Drina Wolves, which is based in the city of Banja Luka. The Army is currently under the control of the Croatian government. It was founded by the Serb-Croatian breakaway state of Bosnian-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 1990s, but has since become part of the Republic of Bosnia and HerzEGovina and the Croat Republic. The VRS is now under the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia & Herzigovina, controlled by the Bosnian Army. The VRS was formed by the breakaway Serb Republic  of Bosnia & Herzeg Lithuania in the early 1990s. It has been under the command of General Ratko Mladi ćić since May 1992. In May 2011, the V RS was taken over by the Serb Army of Bosnia, which was led by General Josip Jokanovic. In April 2012, the VRS was re-established by the Bulgarian Army, led by Gen. Aleksandar Vucic. Lagoon City was the brainchild of the Late Chief Adebayo Adeleke, a University of London trained Civil Engineer (MICE), and CEO of City Property Development Ltd. He wanted to create a development that would ""Make Nigeria Proud"", and engaged Minoru Yamasaki the architect of Manhattan's Twin Towers, to design replica twin towers as the flagship iconic buildings on the main island. The 'acquisition' of the land is currently being challenged in various courts, and there are Caveat Emptor warnings in place to warn prospective buyers that their investment could be at risk in future. The island was constructed by the Lebanese-Nigerian Chagoury Group in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, and is considered to be on par with the Seventh Arrondissement in Paris, La Jolla in San Diego, and Tokyo’s Shibuya and Roppongi neighbourhoods. It occupies a sand-filled area of approximately 1,630,000 square metres and is divided into 536 plots (of between 1000 and 4000 square metres in size) mainly arranged along cul-de-sacs, so designed to enhance the historically residential nature of Ikoyi. Residents are provided with world class utilities including underground electrical systems (versus the overhead cabling common throughout Lagos), an underground water supply network, a central sewage system and treatment plant, and street lighting and satellite telecommunications networks. On the residential side of the Island, planning permission is not granted for dwellings over 3 storeys high. The developers also intend to develop a develop a City Airport, which was a vision conceived long before the London Docklands Development, Dubai's Palm Islands or Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport. The Island is a planned, mixed development with dedicated areas for residential, commercial and recreational activities. It is located in the Lagos Lagoon and is connected to Ikoyo Island by a dedicated road which is linked to the existing road network near Parkview Estate. Banana Island has one of the highest density of millionaires within its boundaries. Main piazza, a club-house, a primary and secondary school, a fire and police station and a medical clinic. Ocean Parade Towers - a series of 14 luxury tower blocks strategically situated at one end of the island to take advantage of 180 degree panoramic views overlooking the lagoon. At launch flats in Ocean Parade sold for over US$400,000. Several leading Nigerian and International corporates such as - Etisalat Nigeria, Airtel Nigeria, Ford Foundation Nigeria and Olaniwun Ajayi & Co - are also based on Banana Island. The city is divided into the subdistricts of Nain Feto, Vera Cruz, Dom Aleixo and Cristo Rei. It is the seat of the administration of the district of Dili, which is the administrative entity of the area and includes the island of Atauro and some cities close to Dili city. Dili is a melting pot of the different ethnic groups of East Timor, due partly to the internal migration of young men from around the country in search of work. This has led to a gender imbalance, with the male population significantly larger than the female. There is no city administration beside the district administrator, who was appointed by state government. The East Timorese government started to plan in 2009 to change the status of districts into municipalities. These will have an elected mayor and council. The 2010 census recorded a population of 193,563 in the areas of the Dili district classified as urban, with a total population of 234,331 in the whole district including rural areas such as Metinaro. The island was briefly occupied by the Japanese during World War II in the night of 19 February 1942, with around 20,000 men, before spreading o spreading o the island. It was proclaimed a city in 1864. During War II, Portugal remained neutral, but the Allies saw the Timor as a potential target for the Japanese invasion, and the island was occupied in 1941. It has a Tropical wet and dry climate under the Köppen climate classification. The capital city of Timor is Dili (Portuguese/Tetum: Díli, Indonesian: Kota Dili) is the capital, largest city, chief port and commercial centre of EastTimor. The country's population is 1.2 million, with 54% of the inhabitants born in the city. East Timor declared independence from Portugal on 28 November 1975. On 7 December 1976, Indonesian forces invaded Dili. A guerrilla war ensued between Indonesian and pro-independence forces. In 1999, East Timor was placed under UN supervision and on 20 May 2002, Dili became the capital of the newly independent Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. Dili is served by Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport, the only functioning international airport in the country. In January 2008, the Portuguese charter airline EuroAtlantic Airways operated a direct flight from Lisbon using a Boeing 757, carrying 140 members of the Guarda Nacional Republicana. There are four International schools in Dili, a Portuguese school by the name of Escola Portuguesa Ruy Cinatti, an Australian managed school and the Maharlika International School (Formerly Dili Education & Development Center), a Philippine International School. The Church of the Immaculate Conception, seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Díli, is purportedly the largest cathedral in Southeast Asia, and the 'Integration Monument' is a 27-metre (88.6 ft) tall statue of Jesus situated on top of a globe at the end of a peninsula. It was a present from the Indonesian Government during occupation for the 20th anniversary of East Timorese's integration into Indonesia. It is one of the town's landmarks. The former Portuguese Governor's office is now the office of the Prime Minister, and was previously also used by the Indonesian-appointed Governor, and by the United Nations Transitional Administration in EastTimor (UNTAET). Even under Indonesian rule, during which the Portuguese language was banned, Portuguese street names like Avenida Marechal Carmona remained unchanged, although they were prefixed with the Indonesian word Jalan or 'road' The Roman Catholic Church at Motael became a focus for resistance to Indonesian occupation. In May 2006, fighting and rioting sparked by conflict between elements of the military caused significant damage to the city and led to foreign military intervention to restore order. Until recently, the airport runway has been unable to accommodate aircraft larger than the Boeing 737 or C-130 Hercules, but there are airstrips in Baucau, Suai and Oecusse.

It is an elegant bird of prey, appearing sickle-like in flight with its long pointed wings and square tail. It will take large insects, such as dragonflies, which it transfers from talons to beak and eats while soaring slowly in circles. Its speed and aerobatic skills enable it to take swallows and even swifts on the wing, and barn swallows or house martins have a characteristic ""hobby"" alarm call. It lays 2–4 eggs. Incubation is said to take 28 days and both parents share in this duty, though the female does the greater part. While on migration, they may move in small groups. The tree selected is most often one in a hedge or on the extreme edge of a spinney, whence the bird can observe intruders from a considerable distance. It was used in falconry, trained to hawk birds like quails, larks, hoopoes, drongos, etc."

President Roosevelt Appoints Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. Ambassador to Britain
Late in 1937, Mr. Kennedy was appointed United States Ambassador to England and moved there with his whole family, with the exception of Joe and Jack who were at Harvard.
Because of his father’s job, Jack became very interested in European politics and world affairs. After a summer visit to England and other countries in Europe, Jack returned to Harvard more eager to learn about history and government and to keep up with current events.

In 1938, Roosevelt appointed Kennedy as the United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James (Britain). Kennedy's Irish and Catholic status did not bother the British; indeed he hugely enjoyed his leadership position in London society, which stood in stark contrast to his outsider status in Boston. His daughter Kathleen married the heir to the Duke of Devonshire, the head of one of England's grandest aristocratic families. Kennedy rejected the warnings of Winston Churchill that compromise with Nazi Germany was impossible; instead he supported Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement in order to stave off a second world war that would be a more horrible ""armageddon"" than the first. Throughout 1938, as the Nazi persecution of Jews intensified, Kennedy attempted to obtain an audience with Adolf Hitler. Shortly before the Nazi aerial bombing of British cities began in September 1940, Kennedy sought a personal meeting with Hitler, again without State Department approval, ""to bring about a better understanding between the United States and Germany.""
Kennedy argued strongly against giving aid to Britain.
""Democracy is finished in England. It may be here,"" stated Ambassador Kennedy in the Boston Sunday Globe of November 10, 1940. In that one simple statement, Joe Kennedy ruined any future chances of becoming US president, effectively committing political suicide. While bombs fell daily on the UK, Nazi troops occupied Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, Ambassador Kennedy unambiguously and repeatedly stated his belief that the war was not about saving democracy from National Socialism (Nazism) or Fascism. In the now-infamous, long, rambling interview with two newspaper journalists, Louis M. Lyons of the Boston Globe and Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Kennedy opined:
""It's all a question of what we do with the next six months. The whole reason for aiding England is to give us time."" ... ""As long as she is in there, we have time to prepare. It isn't that [Britain is] fighting for democracy. That's the bunk. She's fighting for self-preservation, just as we will if it comes to us... I know more about the European situation than anybody else, and it's up to me to see that the country gets it,""
In British government circles during the Blitz, Ambassador Kennedy was widely disparaged as a defeatist.
When the American public and Roosevelt Administration officials read his quotes on democracy being ""finished"", and his belief that the Battle of Britain wasn't about ""fighting for democracy,"" all of it being just ""bunk"", they realized that Ambassador Kennedy could not be trusted to represent the United States. In the face of national public outcry, he submitted his resignation later that month.
Throughout the rest of the war, relations between Kennedy and the Roosevelt Administration remained tense (especially when Joe Kennedy, Jr., vocally opposed FDR's renomination). Having effectively removed himself from the national stage, Joe Sr. sat out the war on the sidelines. Kennedy did however stay active in the smaller venues of rallying Irish and Roman Catholic Democrats to vote for Roosevelt's reelection in 1944. He claimed to be eager to help the war effort, but as a result of his previous gaffes, he was neither trusted nor re-invited.
With his own ambitions for the White House in self-inflicted ruins, he held out great hope for his eldest son, Joseph Jr., to gain the presidency. However, Joe Jr. was killed over England while undertaking a high-risk bombing mission in 1944. Kennedy then turned his attention to grooming the second son, John F. Kennedy, who won the 1960 election.

Passage:
Four-minute mile
In the sport of athletics, the four-minute mile means completing the mile run (1,760 yards, or 1,609.344 metres) in less than four minutes. It was first achieved in 1954 by Roger Bannister in 3:59.4.  The ""four-minute barrier"" has since been broken by many male athletes, and is now the standard of all male professional middle distance runners. In the last 50 years the mile record has been lowered by almost 17 seconds.  Running a mile in four minutes translates to a speed of 15 miles per hour (24.14 km/h, or 2:29.13 per kilometre, or 14.91 seconds per 100 metres).

Record holders

Breaking the four-minute barrier was first achieved on 6 May 1954 at Oxford University's Iffley Road Track, by Englishman Roger Bannister,  with the help of fellow-runners as pacemakers.    Two months later, during the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games hosted in Vancouver, B.C., two competing runners, Australia's John Landy and Bannister, ran the distance of one mile in under four minutes. The race's end is memorialised in a statue of the two (with Landy glancing over his shoulder, thus losing the race) placed in front of the Pacific National Exhibition entrance plaza.

New Zealand's John Walker, the first man to run the mile under 3:50, managed to run 135 sub-four-minute miles during his career (during which he was the first person to run over 100 sub-four-minute miles), and American Steve Scott has run the most sub-four-minute miles, with 136. Algeria's Noureddine Morceli was the first under 3:45.  Currently, the mile record is held by Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj, who ran a time of 3:43.13 in Rome in 1999.

In 1964, America's Jim Ryun became the first high-school runner to break four minutes for the mile, running 3:59.0 as a junior and a then American record 3:55.3 as a senior in 1965.  Tim Danielson (1966) and Marty Liquori (1967) also came in under four minutes, but Ryun's high-school record stood until Alan Webb ran 3:53.43 in 2001.  Ten years later, in 2011, Lukas Verzbicas became the fifth high-schooler under four minutes.   In 2015, Matthew Maton and Grant Fisher became the sixth and seventh high-schoolers to break four minutes, both running 3:59.38 about a month apart.   Webb was the first high schooler to run sub-4 indoors, running 3:59.86 in early 2001.  On February 6, 2016, Andrew Hunter significantly improved upon Webb's mark, running 3:58.25 on the same New York Armory track  and 3:57.81 two weeks later.   Hunter achieved the 4 minute mile mark outdoors later in the season at the Prefontaine Classic.  At that same meet Michael Slagowski joined the list of high school athletes under 4 minutes. 

Another illustration of the progression of performance in the men's mile is that, in 1994, forty years after Bannister's breaking of the barrier, the Irish runner Eamonn Coghlan became the first man over the age of 40 to run a sub-four-minute mile.  Because Coghlan surpassed the mark indoors and before the IAAF validated indoor performances as being eligible for outdoor records, World Masters Athletics still had not recognised a sub-4-minute-mile performance as a record in the M40 division. Many elite athletes made the attempts to extend their careers beyond age 40 to challenge that mark. Over 18 years after Coghlan, that was finally achieved by UK's Anthony Whiteman, running 3:58.79 on 2 June 2012. 

No woman has yet run a four-minute mile. , the women's world record is held by retired Russian Svetlana Masterkova, with a time of 4:12.56 in 1996. 

In 1997, Daniel Komen of Kenya ran two miles in less than eight minutes, doubling up on Bannister's accomplishment.   He did it again in February 1998, falling just .3 behind his previous performance, still the only individual to accomplish the feat. 

Possible other claims 

James Parrott

Some sources (including Olympic medalist Peter Radford ) contend the first successful four-minute mile was run in London by James Parrott on 9 May 1770.   Parrott's route began on Goswell Road, before turning down Old Street, finishing at St Leonard's, Shoreditch. Although timing methods at this time were – following the invention of the chronometer by John Harrison – accurate enough to measure the four minutes correctly the record is not recognised by modern sporting bodies.  Neal Bascomb notes in The Perfect Mile that ""even nineteenth-century historians cast a skeptical eye on the account."" 

Glenn Cunningham

It is also reputed that Glenn Cunningham achieved a four-minute mile in a workout in the 1920s. In addition to being unsubstantiated, a workout run would not count as a record. 

Popular culture

In 1988, the ABC and the BBC co-produced The Four Minute Mile, a miniseries dramatisation of the race to the four-minute mile, featuring Richard Huw as Bannister and Nique Needles as John Landy (who was simultaneously pursuing the milestone). It was written by David Williamson and directed by Jim Goddard.

In 2004, Neal Bascomb wrote a book entitled The Perfect Mile about Roger Bannister, John Landy, and Wes Santee portraying their individual attempts to break the four-minute mile and the context of the sport of mile racing. A second film version (entitled Four Minutes) was made in 2005, starring Jamie Maclachlan as Bannister.

In June 2011 the watch used to time the original event was donated by Jeffrey Archer to a charity auction for Oxford University Athletics Club and sold for £97,250. 

In July 2016 the BBC released a documentary with firsthand interviews from Bannister and various other figures on the first sub-4 minute mile.

3 minute mile
Passage:
GPO Film Unit
The GPO Film Unit was a subdivision of the UK General Post Office. The unit was established in 1933, taking on responsibilities of the Empire Marketing Board Film Unit. Headed by John Grierson,  it was set up to produce sponsored documentary films mainly related to the activities of the GPO.

Among the films it produced were Harry Watt's and Basil Wright's Night Mail (1936), featuring music by Benjamin Britten and poetry by W. H. Auden, which is the best known. Directors who worked for the unit included Humphrey Jennings, Alberto Cavalcanti, Paul Rotha, Harry Watt, Basil Wright and a young Norman McLaren. Poet and memoirist Laurie Lee also worked as a scriptwriter in the unit from 1939-1940.

In 1940 the GPO Film Unit became the Crown Film Unit, under the control of the Ministry of Information.

In Autumn 2008 the British Film Institute issued a first collection of selected films from the Unit. Titled Addressing The Nation, it comprises fifteen titles from the years 1933 to 1935, including Song of Ceylon. A second volume, We Live In Two Worlds was released in February 2009, with 22 films covering the period 1936 to 1938, and includes Night Mail. A third (and final) volume, If War Should Come, appeared in July 2009 and includes London Can Take It!

Passage:
Marmolada
Marmolada (Ladin: Marmoleda) is a mountain in northeastern Italy  and the highest mountain of the Dolomites (a section of the Alps). It lies between the borders of Trentino and Veneto.

Geography

The mountain is located about 100 kilometres north-northwest of Venice, from which it can be seen on a clear day. It consists of a ridge running west to east. Towards the south it breaks suddenly into sheer cliffs, forming a rock face several kilometres long. On the north side there is a comparatively flat glacier, the only large glacier in the Dolomites (the Marmolada Glacier, Ghiacciaio della Marmolada).

The ridge is composed of several summits, decreasing in altitude from west to east: Punta Penia (3,343 m), Punta Rocca (3,309 m), Punta Ombretta (3,230 m), Monte Serauta (3,069 m), and Pizzo Serauta (3,035 m). An aerial tramway goes to the top of Punta Rocca. During the ski season the Marmolada's main ski run is opened for skiers and snowboarders alike, making it possible to ski down into the valley.

History

Paul Grohmann made the first ascent in 1864, along the north route. The south face was climbed for the first time in 1901 by Beatrice Tomasson, Michele Bettega and Bartolo Zagonel.

Until the end of World War I the border between Austria-Hungary and Italy ran over Marmolada, so it formed part of the front line during that conflict. Austro-Hungarian soldiers were quartered in deep tunnels bored into the northern face's glacier, and Italian soldiers were quartered on the south face's rocky precipices.  As glaciers retreat, soldiers' remains and belongings are occasionally discovered.

"Passage:
TL;DR
TL;DR, short for ""too long; didn't read"", is an expression used in Internet culture to say that some text being replied to has been ignored or as a signifier for a summary of an online post or news article. It originates in Internet slang, where it is often used in quoted responses to indicate parts of the text skipped as too lengthy.

The abbreviation is based on the principle that, if the writer does not invest the time to convey their message concisely, the reader is justified not investing the time to read it. Alternately, it might mean that there is insufficient material of value or interest to justify the time required to read it.

The phrase dates back to at least 2003, and was added to the Oxford Dictionaries Online in 2013. 

TL;DR: TL;DR is internet slang for ""too long, didn't read""

Eponyms

On reddit, tldr  is the subreddit serving as the site's daily recap. Long posts on reddit are also frequently followed or preceded by a summary, consisting of a sentence or brief paragraph, that is prefixed by the phrase ""TL;DR"", and the abbreviation is sometimes used as a noun denoting such a summary, as in ""Please include a TL;DR along with your post"".

The phrase inspired the name of Terms of Service; Didn't Read, a website that aims to analyze and grade the terms of service and privacy policies of major service providers.

Late string quartets (Beethoven)
Ludwig van Beethoven's late string quartets are the following works:
*Opus 127: String Quartet No. 12 in E-flat major (1825)
*Opus 130: String Quartet No. 13 in B-flat major (1825)
*Opus 131: String Quartet No. 14 in C-sharp minor (1826)
*Opus 132: String Quartet No. 15 in A minor (1825)
*Opus 133: Große Fuge in B-flat major for string quartet (1826; originally the finale to Op. 130; it also exists in a piano transcription, Op. 134)
*Opus 135: String Quartet No. 16 in F major (1826)

These six works are Beethoven's last major completed compositions. Although dismissed by the musicians and audiences of Beethoven's time, they are widely considered to be among the greatest musical compositions of all time, and have inspired many composers and musicians. Igor Stravinsky described the Große Fuge as ""an absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever"". Richard Wagner, when reflecting on Op. 131's first movement, said that it ""reveals the most melancholy sentiment expressed in music"". The quartets have been performed and recorded by string quartets worldwide.

Overview

Prince Nikolai Galitzine commissioned the first three quartets (numbers 12, 13 and 15) and in a letter dated 9 November 1822, offered to pay Beethoven ""what you think proper"" for the three works. Beethoven replied on 25 January 1823 with his price of 50 ducats for each opus.  Beethoven composed these quartets in the sequence 12, 15, 13, 14, 16, simultaneously writing quartets 15 and 13. 

Beethoven wrote the last quartets in failing health. In April 1825 he was bedridden, and remained ill for about a month. The illness—or more precisely, his recovery from it—is remembered for having given rise to the deeply felt slow movement of the Fifteenth Quartet, which Beethoven called ""Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the divinity, from one made well."" He went on to complete the quartets now numbered Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Sixteenth. The last work Beethoven completed was the substitute final movement of the Thirteenth Quartet, which replaced the difficult Große Fuge.

Appraisal

These quartets went far beyond the comprehension of musicians and audiences of the time. One musician commented that ""we know there is something there, but we do not know what it is."" Composer Louis Spohr called them ""indecipherable, uncorrected horrors."" Opinion has changed considerably from the time of their first bewildered reception: these six quartets (counting the Große Fuge) comprise Beethoven's last major, completed compositions and are widely considered to be among the greatest musical compositions of all time.  The musicologist Theodor Adorno, in particular, thought highly of them,  and Igor Stravinsky described the Große Fuge as ""an absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever"".  Their forms and ideas inspired and continue to inspire musicians and composers, such as Richard Wagner and Béla Bartók. Wagner, when reflecting on Op. 131's first movement, said that it ""reveals the most melancholy sentiment expressed in music"".  The last musical wish of Schubert was to hear the Op. 131 quartet, which he did on 14 November 1828, five days before his death.  Upon listening to a performance of the Op. 131 quartet, Schubert remarked, ""After this, what is left for us to write?""  Of the late quartets, Beethoven's favorite was the Fourteenth Quartet, op. 131 in C minor, which he rated as his most perfect single work. 

Other versions

Transcriptions of some of the late quartets for string orchestra have been made by Arturo Toscanini and Felix Weingartner, among others.

Passage:
Green Flag
Green Flag is a British roadside assistance and vehicle recovery provider which is part of the Direct Line Group. Formed in 1971 (as the National Breakdown Recovery Club) as an alternative to the AA and RAC, using a network of local garages and mechanics to deliver recovery and repair services instead of patrolling mechanics. Originally based in Pudsey, their operations are now controlled over several offices within the Direct Line Group.

History

Green Flag started as an idea between two friends - Bob Slicer and Jeffery Pittock - in a pub in Bradford.

At the time, the AA and RAC were well-established, and offered assistance at the roadside. Slicer and Pittock's National Breakdown Recovery Club operated under a different model, using a network of garages and mechanics that would recover and fix member's cars. The mechanics' local knowledge was meant to provide a swifter response to calls than the established competition. When the service began as a three-man business (with Ernest Smith) in 1971, membership only covered breakdowns within a 50-mile radius of their Morley Street base in Bradford, and cost £1.50 a year. Within three years, NBRC had become the UK's largest breakdown recovery firm with over 100,000 members.

In 1984 NBRC was acquired by National Car Parks (NCP) and five years later moved to new purpose-built headquarters in Pudsey, which were opened by Diana, Princess of Wales.

The company was renamed Green Flag in 1994.  The company, now being run by Ernest Smith as Chief Executive, was looking to expand into other insurance services. ""Green is the symbol of health in Europe,"" Smith told The Independent at the time. 

NCP was bought out by US investment firm Cendant who put Green Flag up for sale in May 1999, after regulators blocked their attempt to gain critical mass by also buying RAC. Later that year, Green Flag became part of the RBS Group when it was acquired by Direct Line for £220m. 

2008 saw Green Flag announce that it would be branding 400 vans across its network to match its marketing. 

In 2011 Green Flag reviewed its network of contractors, reducing the number of partner firms from 283 to 173, with a number of firms reacting angrily to the decision.   Now, five firms represent the majority of Green Flag's network. 

RBS' insurance division was floated in October 2012 as Direct Line Group. The new company had declared itself a separate entity the previous month. 

In 2015, Direct Line Group announced it would consolidate their sites in Leeds area - with the closure of the old Green Flag site in Pudsey. All staff would be retained and moved to one of their two sites in Leeds Headrow and The Wharf buildings,  with Green Flag operations in Glasgow and other offices continuing as normal. 

Services 

Green Flag offer a range of breakdown products, from basic roadside assistance to full European cover with recovery, covering cars, motorbikes, trailers and small vans.

The company claim a response time of 42 minutes and that they have over 4m customers.

Green Flag's services are also available through partners including Direct Line, Churchill, Sainsbury's Bank, Esure, RBS and NatWest. They also operate a specialist breakdown service for caravan and motorhome owners on behalf of the Caravan Club.

Like the rest of the Direct Line Group, Green Flag's products are underwritten by U K Insurance Limited.

Advertising

In 2010, mascot Maximili'ant was introduced to Green Flag's marketing.  An ant was chosen as the company claims ""they're hard working, strong and work well in a team - qualities reflected in the Green Flag network.""   The character was brought to life by the voice of Harry Hill in TV and radio advertising until 2012.

Sponsorships 

In 1994, Green Flag became the first brand to sponsor the England football team.  The deal ran from 1994 to the 1998 FIFA World Cup, including UEFA Euro 1996, and is believed to have cost the firm £4m. 

Between 2000 and 2002, the company were the main title sponsor British Formula 3 Championship  and then, between 2002 and 2004, the British Touring Car Championship.  This was not the company's first motorsport sponsorship, as National Breakdown had sponsored rallies between 1984 and 1987. 

2004 saw the company dabble in football again as they took up sponsorship of AOL's coverage of Euro 2004. 

The Green Flag logo appeared on the Williams F1 team cars of Nico Rosberg and Kazuki Nakajima (2009) and Rubens Barichello and Nico Hülkenberg (2010) as part of the RBS sponsorship. 

Green Flag is the current sponsor of British gymnast Nile Wilson. 

On 28 February 2014, Green Flag announced that it had become a sponsor of Premiership Rugby. 

From 21 June 2015 to present, Green Flag is currently the sponsor the national weather on ITV and UTV.

Mary Jane (shoe)
Mary Jane (Also known as bar shoes) is an American term (formerly a registered trademark) for a closed, low-cut shoe with one or more straps across the instep.

Classic Mary Janes for children are typically made of black leather or patent leather, have one thin strap fastened with a buckle or button, a broad and rounded toebox, low heels, and thin outsoles. Among girls, Mary Janes are traditionally worn with pantyhose or socks, and a dress or a skirt and blouse. Among boys (less common), Mary Janes are traditionally worn with socks, short trousers, and a shirt.

History

Children's shoes secured by a strap over the instep and fastened with a buckle or button appeared in the early 19th century. Originally worn by both sexes, they began to be perceived as being mostly for girls in the 1930s in North America and the 1940s in Europe.  They were also popular with women in the 1920s. 

Today, Mary Janes for children, particularly the more classic styles, are often considered semi-formal or formal shoes, appropriate for school (many schools worldwide require that girls wear them with their uniform), religious ceremonies, weddings, visits, and birthday parties for example. More modern styles are also worn in casual settings, however: playgrounds, shopping centers, sports (Mary Jane sneakers), etc. Although less popular than in the past, Mary Janes remain a timeless classic of children's fashion and, for many people, a symbol of girlhood.

Moreover, Mary Janes are a preferred accessory of many traditional or folk costumes, such as those of the flamenco female dancer and of the typical woman in Mao's China and Kim's North Korea. 

Etymology

Mary Jane was a character created by Richard Felton Outcault ""Father of the Sunday Comic Strip"" for his comic strip Buster Brown, which was first published in 1902. She was the ""sweetheart"" of the title character Buster Brown and was drawn from real life, as she was also Outcault's daughter of the same name.  In Outcault's own words—and his daughter's—she was the only character drawn from life in the Buster Brown strip, although ""Mrs. Brown"" did resemble Outcault's wife.

In 1904, Outcault traveled to the St. Louis World's Fair and sold licenses to up to 200 companies to use the Buster Brown characters to advertise their products. Among them was the Brown Shoe Company, which later hired actors to tour the country, performing as the Buster Brown characters in theaters and stores. This strategy helped the Brown Shoe Company become the most prominently associated brand with the Buster Brown characters. The style of shoe both Buster Brown and Mary Jane wore came to be known by her name, Mary Jane.

Adult styles

While the classic Mary Jane still retains its wide popularity and appeal, platform style Mary Janes have also evolved since the late 1990s, with 1-cm to 3-cm (½-in to 1-in) outsoles and 8-cm to 13-cm (3-in to 5-in) ""chunky"" heels, often with exaggerated grommets or buckles. These styles were especially popular in the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s, within punk rock, psychobilly, and goth subcultures. Many times the wearers would accent the look with knee-high knit socks in dark-colored stripes or patterns and/or some form of hosiery (stockings/pantyhose), and often complete the look with a plaid, pleated schoolgirl-style skirt.

During the early 2000s, block heeled mary jane shoes were popular in the United Kingdom and were fastened by a rectangular chrome buckle and were made under various brand names such as No Doubt, Koi Couture etc.

Mary Janes are a popular part of kinderwhore and Lolita fashion. A pump with a strap across the instep may be referred to as a ""Mary Jane pump"", although it does not have the low heels or wide toe of the original Mary Jane (and a pump is generally strapless by definition).

Passage:
Mr. Peanut
Mr. Peanut is the advertising logo and mascot of Planters, an American snack-food company and division of Kraft Foods. He is depicted as an anthropomorphic peanut in its shell dressed in the formal clothing of an old-fashioned gentleman: a top hat, monocle, white gloves, spats, and a cane.

History

Planters Peanut Company was founded in 1906, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania by Amedeo Obici and was incorporated two years later as the Planters Nut and Chocolate Company.  In 1916 a young schoolboy Antonio Gentile, submitted drawings of an anthropomorphic peanut, a commercial artist, Andrew S. Wallach added the monocle, top hat and cane to create the iconic image.  The schoolboy's family is believed to have received five dollars for the submission.    

There is a disputed claim that Frank P. Krize, Sr., a Wikes-Barre artist and head of the Suffolk plant, made the additions of the monocle, top hat and cane.  Andrew Wallach's daughter, Virginia, maintains that Frank P. Krize joined the project after Mr. Peanut was created.  Planter's history and other sources still in circulation, do not positively identify the artist.     

By the mid-1930s, the raffish figure had come to symbolize the entire peanut industry. Mr. Peanut has appeared on almost every Planters package and advertisement. He is now one of the best-known icons in advertising history. 

Mr. Peanut has appeared in many TV commercials as an animated cartoon character. More recent commercials have shown him stop motion animated in a real-world setting.

In 2006, Planters conducted an online contest to determine whether to add a bow tie, cufflinks, or a pocketwatch to Mr. Peanut.  The public voted for no change. 

While the character's television commercials were often accompanied by an elegant accented narrator, Mr. Peanut never had dialogue. On November 8, 2010, Planters announced that Mr. Peanut would officially be given a voice, supplied by American actor Robert Downey Jr. 

In 2011 Mr. Peanut's ""stunt double"" named Peanut Butter Doug was introduced to tie-in with the Planter's Peanut Butter launch. The character is voiced by Kevin Dillon. 

Planters announced on July 1, 2013 that its mascot, Mr. Peanut, would be voiced by comedian and Saturday Night Live alumnus Bill Hader,  who, ironically, is allergic to peanuts. 

In literature

*In the 2010 novel Mr. Peanut, a man fantasizes about killing his peanut-allergic wife by force-feeding her peanuts.   ""He poured out a handful and ate them and then wiped the salt from his empty hand on his pants.  He looked at the chipper Planters Peanuts man tipping his top hat hello and thought about how one bite could kill Alice dead."" 

In popular culture

*The artist Vincent Trasov, dressed as Mr. Peanut, ran as a joke candidate in the 1974 Vancouver, British Columbia civic elections. 
*In November 2010, The New Yorker magazine published a spoof confession by Mr. Peanut that he is gay and in a relationship with his new sidekick, Benson. 
*Mr. Peanut appears as a monster in the online game Kingdom of Loathing.

NICOLA Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell last night gave a rare glimpse into their private life when they were asked about their lack of children, her fashion choices and what it is like to be Scotland’s first female First Minister.
In an interview with STV’s Spotlight programme, Ms Sturgeon was also asked about her relationship with her predecessor Alex Salmond.
The couple gave a rare glimpse of their private life. Picture: STV
Ms Sturgeon denied that Mr Salmond was still pulling the strings in the SNP, but said she can always go to him for advice.
She contrasted their positive relationship with the “dysfunctional” one between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.
Ms Sturgeon said there was “an understandable curiosity” about the couple’s family life, but added that Alex Salmond was rarely asked about his lack of children.
Mr Murrell, the SNP’s chief executive, added that his wife gets asked a lot of questions that would not be asked of a man.
Ms Sturgeon said: “Alex Salmond doesn’t have children. He might tell you differently, but I’m not aware of reading an interview or seeing an interview with Alex Salmond being asked that question.”
She added: “I’m not moaning about this, but it’s just one of these things that I think is just a bit different if you’re a woman in politics.”
Mr Murrell added: “It’s just one of those questions that a female politician gets asked. A man would never get asked about clothes or hair or something else. It’s just different.”
The couple were shown in Totty Rocks, a fashion store that supplies Ms Sturgeon with outfits.

Passage:
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States
Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States are the members of the Supreme Court of the United States other than the Chief Justice of the United States. The number of Associate Justices is determined by the United States Congress and is currently set at eight by the Judiciary Act of 1869.

Like the Chief Justice, Associate Justices are nominated by the President of the United States and are confirmed by the United States Senate by majority vote. This is provided for in Article II of the Constitution, which states that the President ""shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint... Judges of the supreme Court."" Although the Constitution refers to them as ""Judges of the Supreme Court,"" the title actually used is ""Associate Justice,"" introduced in the Judiciary Act of 1789.  Associate justices were traditionally styled ""Mr. Justice"" in court opinions, but the title was shortened to ""Justice"" in 1980, a year before the first female justice was appointed. 

Article III of the Constitution specifies that Associate Justices, and all other United States federal judges ""shall hold their Offices during good Behavior"". This language means that the appointments are effectively for life, ending only when a Justice dies in office, retires, or is removed from office following impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. 

Each of the Justices of the Supreme Court has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it; the Chief Justice's vote counts no more than that of any other Justice. However, in drafting opinions, the Chief Justice enjoys additional influence in case disposition if in the majority through his power to assign who writes the opinion. Otherwise, the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision. Furthermore, the Chief Justice leads the discussion of the case among the justices. The Chief Justice has certain administrative responsibilities that the other Justices do not and is paid slightly more ($255,500 per year for the Chief Justice and $244,400 per year for each Associate Justice ).

Associate Justices have seniority by order of appointment, although the Chief Justice is always considered to be the most senior. If two justices are appointed on the same day, the older is designated the senior Justice of the two. Currently, the senior Associate Justice is Anthony Kennedy. By tradition, when the Justices are in conference deliberating the outcome of cases before the Court, the justices state their views in order of seniority. If there is a knock at their conference room door, the junior justice (who sits closest to the door) must answer it. The current junior justice is Elena Kagan.

Under 28 USC [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/3.html 3], when the Chief Justice is unable to discharge his functions, or that office is vacant, his duties are carried out by the most senior Associate Justice until the disability or the vacancy ends.

The sitting Associate Justices are, ordered by seniority:

Retired Associate Justices

When Justices retire, they have the opportunity to assume duties similar to the senior status assumed by District and Circuit Judges. This means that the Justice keeps his or her title, and may serve by assignment on panels of the U.S. Courts of Appeals, or even the US District Courts if so requested and assigned. Retired Justices may choose to keep a set of chambers in the Supreme Court building, as well as to employ law clerks. The names of retired Associate Justices continue to appear alongside those of the active Justices of the Court on the Bound Volumes of Supreme Court decisions. However, retired Associate Justices (unlike judges on senior status) take no part in the consideration or decision of any cases before their former court (the Supreme Court), although they may be appointed by the Chief Justice to sit on lower courts.

Currently, there are three retired Associate Justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, who retired on January 31, 2006, David H. Souter, who retired on June 29, 2009, and John Paul Stevens, who retired on June 29, 2010. Both O'Connor and Souter occasionally serve on panels of the Courts of Appeals of various circuits. As of present, Stevens has chosen not to so serve.

Rash
A rash is a change of the skin which affects its color, appearance, or texture.

A rash may be localized in one part of the body, or affect all the skin. Rashes may cause the skin to change color, itch, become warm, bumpy, chapped, dry, cracked or blistered, swell, and may be painful.

The causes, and therefore treatments for rashes, vary widely. Diagnosis must take into account such things as the appearance of the rash, other symptoms, what the patient may have been exposed to, occupation, and occurrence in family members. Rash can last 5 to 20 days, the diagnosis may confirm any number of conditions.

The presence of a rash may aid diagnosis; associated signs and symptoms are diagnostic of certain diseases. For example, the rash in measles is an erythematous, morbilliform, maculopapular rash that begins a few days after the fever starts. It classically starts at the head, and spreads downwards.

Differential diagnosis 

Common causes of rashes include:
* Food Allergy
* Anxiety
* Allergies, for example to food, dyes, medicines, insect stings, metals such as zinc or nickel; such rashes are often called hives.
* Skin contact with an irritant
** Fungal infection, such as ringworm
** Balsam of Peru 
* Reaction to vaccination
* Skin diseases such as eczema or acne
* Exposure to sun (sunburn) or heat
* Friction due to chafing of the skin
* Irritation such as caused by abrasives impregnated in clothing rubbing the skin. The cloth itself may be abrasive enough for some people
* 
* Secondary syphilis
* Poor personal hygiene
Uncommon causes:
* Autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis
* Lead poisoning
* Pregnancy
* Repeated scratching on a particular spot
* Lyme Disease
* Scarlet fever

Conditions

Diagnostic approach

The causes of a rash are numerous, which may make the evaluation of a rash extremely difficult. An accurate evaluation by a provider may only be made in the context of a thorough history (What medication is the patient taking? What is the patient's occupation? Where has the patient been?) and complete physical examination.

Points to note in the examination include:

* The appearance: e.g., purpuric (typical of vasculitis and meningococcal disease), fine and like sandpaper (typical of scarlet fever); circular lesions with a central depression are typical of molluscum contagiosum (and in the past, small pox); plaques with silver scales are typical of psoriasis.
* The distribution: e.g., the rash of scarlet fever becomes confluent and forms bright red lines in the skin creases of the neck, armpits and groins (Pastia's lines); the vesicles of chicken pox seem to follow the hollows of the body (they are more prominent along the depression of the spine on the back and in the hollows of both shoulder blades); very few rashes affect the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (secondary syphilis, rickettsia or spotted fevers, [http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hlen&lr

* Symmetry: e.g., herpes zoster usually only affects one side of the body and does not cross the midline.

A patch test may be ordered, for diagnostic purposes. 

Treatment

Treatment differs according to what rash a patient has been diagnosed with. Common rashes can be easily remedied using steroid topical creams (such as hydrocortisone) or non-steroidal treatments. Many of the medications are available over the counter in the United States. 

The problem with steroid topical creams i.e. hydrocortisone; is their inability to penetrate the skin through absorption and therefore not be effective in clearing up the affected area, thus rendering the hydrocortisone almost completely ineffective in all except the most mild of cases.

Passage:
Cillit Bang
Cillit Bang (sold in some countries as Easy-Off Bam or Easy-Off Bang) is the brand name of a range of cleaning products sold by the consumer products manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser. The products marketed under the brand name include a degreaser, cleaning crystals, and a grime, rust, mould and limescale remover.

Product range

Cillit Bang Power Grime and Lime Spray

Cillit Bang Grime and Lime Spray (known in some countries as Easy off Bang/Bam Power Grime and Lime Cleaner Trigger) product contains two acids: sulfamic acid and phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid (also known as orthophosphoric acid or phosphoric (V) acid) is a weak mineral acid with the chemical formula 34 and applied to rusted iron or steel tools or surfaces to convert iron (III) oxide (rust) to a water-soluble phosphate compound.

This cleaner can be used on glass, acrylic plastic, ceramics (washbasins, toilet bowls, etc.), wall and floor tiles, PVC floor coating, copper, chrome and kitchen tops.

It should not be used on any acid sensitive material, such as marble or enamel, aluminium, stone, zinc-plated metals, kitchen worktops, linoleum, varnished, waxed or oiled wood floors, rubber, textiles or carpets.

A Canadian advert for the product features a disclaimer that the Royal Canadian Mint ""neither endorses the product nor the method shown for the cleaning of coins"".

Cillit Bang Power Crystal

Cillit Bang Power Crystal (known outside the UK as Easy-Off Bang/Bam Power Cleaning Crystal) is a liquid for cleaning heavily stained surfaces. It contains not more than 5% of anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, 15-30% of sodium carbonate, sodium percarbonate (the bleaching compound), and a perfume formula containing limonene. It is a skin irritant and can cause allergic reactions in some people, so the company now advises the use of gloves during prolonged exposure.

Advertising campaign

UK advertisements have been presented by ""Barry Scott"", a brashly enthusiastic character played by Neil Burgess, who claims that Cillit Bang can remove limescale, rust and ground-in dirt. In one advert he places a copper-plated one penny coin in Cillit Bang to demonstrate the product's cleaning ability to remove staining.

In January 2016, Reckitt Benckiser launched its first global campaign, starring dancer Daniel Campos. 

Other countries' versions of the advert use different presenters, known as Martin Grellis in Australia and New Zealand, and Dan Dolan in North America, although recent spots feature Neil Burgess as Barry Scott.  Dan demonstrates the cleaning methods seen in the Cillit Bang adverts and also cleans oil spills. The North American versions of the advertisement use the appropriate one-cent coin (a Lincoln cent in the U.S., a 1953–1964 one cent coin in Canada).

Outside Europe

The product is sold as Easy-Off BAM (a brand extension of Reckitt Benckiser's popular oven cleaner) in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Mexico, and as ""Easy-Off BANG"" in South Africa and Korea, with similar packaging and spray bottle design.

Industrial use

In August 2009 it was revealed that household cleaners such as Cillit Bang and Mr. Muscle have been used to clean plutonium stains at the defunct Dounreay nuclear power station in Caithness, Scotland.

Passage:
Farthing (British coin)
The British farthing (¼d) coin, from ""fourthing"", was a unit of currency of one quarter of a penny, or one nine hundred and sixtieth of a pound sterling. It was minted in bronze, and replaced the earlier copper farthings. It was used during the reign of six monarchs: Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II, ceasing to be legal tender in 1960. It featured two different designs on its reverse during its one hundred years in circulation: from 1860 until 1936, the image of Britannia; and from 1937 onwards, the image of a wren. Like all British coinage, it bore the portrait of the monarch on the obverse. 

Before Decimal Day in 1971, there were two hundred and forty pence in one pound sterling. There were four farthings in a penny, twelve pence made a shilling, and twenty shillings made a pound. Values less than a pound were usually written in terms of shillings and pence, e.g. three shillings and six pence (3/6), pronounced ""three and six"" or ""three and sixpence"". Values of less than a shilling were simply written in terms of pence, e.g. 8d, pronounced ""eightpence"". A price with a farthing in it would be written like this: (19/11¼), pronounced ""nineteen and elevenpence farthing"".

As of 2014, the purchasing power of a farthing in 1960 (at its demise) ranged between 2p and 7p (in 2014 GB Pound values). 

Design 

The original reverse of the coin, designed by Leonard Charles Wyon, is a seated Britannia, holding a trident, with the word  above. Issues before 1895 also feature a lighthouse to Britannia's left and a ship to her right. Various minor adjustments to the level of the sea depicted around Britannia, and the angle of her trident were also made over the years. Some issues feature toothed edges, while others feature beading.

Over the years, seven different obverses were used. Edward VII, George V, George VI and Elizabeth II each had a single obverse for farthings produced during their respective reigns. Over the long reign of Queen Victoria two different obverses were used, and the short reign of Edward VIII meant that no farthings bearing his likeness were ever issued.

The farthing was first issued with the so-called ""bun head"", or ""draped bust"" of Queen Victoria on the obverse. The inscription around the bust read  (abbreviated Latin: Victoria by the grace of God queen of Britain defender of the faith). This was replaced in 1895 by the ""old head"", or ""veiled bust"". The inscription on these coins read  (Victoria by the grace of God queen of Britain defender of the faith empress of India).

Coins issued during the reign of Edward VII feature his likeness and bear the inscription  (Edward VII by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India). Similarly, those issued during the reign of George V feature his likeness and bear the inscription  (George V by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India).

A farthing of King Edward VIII (1936) does exist, dated 1937, but technically it is a pattern coin i.e. one produced for official approval, which it would probably have been due to receive about the time that the King abdicated. The obverse shows a left-facing portrait of the king (who considered this to be his best side, and consequently broke the tradition of alternating the direction in which the monarch faces on coins — some viewed this as indicating bad luck for the reign); the inscription on the obverse is  (Edward VIII by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India).

The pattern coin of Edward VIII and regular-issue farthings of George VI and Elizabeth II feature a redesigned reverse displaying the wren, one of Britain's smallest birds.

George VI issue coins feature the inscription  (George VI by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India) before 1949, and  (George VI by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith) thereafter. Unlike the penny, farthings were minted throughout the early reign of Elizabeth II, bearing the inscription  (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen of all Britain defender of the faith) in 1953, and  (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen defender of the faith) thereafter.

Passage:
Solid mechanics
Solid mechanics is the branch of continuum mechanics that studies the behavior of solid materials, especially their motion and deformation under the action of forces, temperature changes, phase changes, and other external or internal agents.

Solid mechanics is fundamental for civil, aerospace, nuclear, and mechanical engineering, for geology, and for many branches of physics such as materials science.  It has specific applications in many other areas, such as understanding the anatomy of living beings, and the design of dental prostheses and surgical implants.  One of the most common practical applications of solid mechanics is the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. Solid mechanics extensively uses tensors to describe stresses, strains, and the relationship between them.

Relationship to continuum mechanics

As shown in the following table, solid mechanics inhabits a central place within continuum mechanics.  The field of rheology presents an overlap between solid and fluid mechanics.

Response models

A material has a rest shape and its shape departs away from the rest shape due to stress. The amount of departure from rest shape is called deformation, the proportion of deformation to original size is called strain. If the applied stress is sufficiently low (or the imposed strain is small enough), almost all solid materials behave in such a way that the strain is directly proportional to the stress; the coefficient of the proportion is called the modulus of elasticity.  This region of deformation is known as the linearly elastic region.

It is most common for analysts in solid mechanics to use linear material models, due to ease of computation. However, real materials often exhibit non-linear behavior. As new materials are used and old ones are pushed to their limits, non-linear material models are becoming more common.

There are four basic models that describe how a solid responds to an applied stress:
# Elastically – When an applied stress is removed, the material returns to its undeformed state. Linearly elastic materials, those that deform proportionally to the applied load, can be described by the linear elasticity equations such as Hooke's law.
# Viscoelastically – These are materials that behave elastically, but also have damping: when the stress is applied and removed, work has to be done against the damping effects and is converted in heat within the material resulting in a hysteresis loop in the stress–strain curve. This implies that the material response has time-dependence.
# Plastically – Materials that behave elastically generally do so when the applied stress is less than a yield value. When the stress is greater than the yield stress, the material behaves plastically and does not return to its previous state. That is, deformation that occurs after yield is permanent.
# Thermoelasticity (physics) - There is coupling of mechanical with thermal responses. In general, thermoelasticity is concerned with elastic solids under conditions that are neither isothermal nor adiabatic. The simplest theory involves the Fourier's law of heat conduction, as opposed to advanced theories with physically more realistic models.

The White House - Fact Monster
The White House
The White House
Where the President Lives and Works
Watch this video to learn facts about the famous landmark, the White House, in Washington, D.C.
Choosing a City
In the late 1700s, it was decided that our country needed a capital city. Our first president, George Washington, picked a site on the Potomac River, midway between the northern and southern states. This spot would come to be called Washington, District of Columbia.
Pierre L'Enfant, a city planner from France, designed the new city. He decided to place the Capitol Building on one hill and the ""President's House"" on another hill. L'Enfant had many plans for building the city, but he lost his job after too many disagreements with landowners. The streets and parks that exist in Washington, D.C., today are the result of the work of two surveyors, Andrew Ellicott and Benjamin Banneker, who made maps and plans based on L'Enfant's original designs.
The original District of Columbia was like a wilderness, and the Potomac River caused the area to be marshy. Pigs roamed the streets, and mosquitoes made people sick from malaria. Conditions improved, however, when the marshes, creeks, and canals were drained.
Building the White House
While the city of Washington, D.C. was being developed, the president's house was also getting under way. A contest was held to select a designer for the house. While it is said that our third president, Thomas Jefferson, submitted designs for the house, architect James Hoban won the contest.
Work on the house began in 1792. Stonemasons were hired from Scotland. Bricks were made on the north lawn. Sandstone was brought from Stafford County, Virginia, and lumber from North Carolina and Virginia.
President George Washington oversaw construction of the White House, but he never lived there! It was our second president, John Adams, elected in 1796, who first lived in the White House. His term was almost over by the time he moved in, and only six rooms had been finished.
While James Madison was president, from 1809 to 1817, the United States went to war with England. On August 24, 1814, British soldiers sailed up the Potomac River and set fire to the White House. A summer thunderstorm put out the fire, but only the charred outside walls and the interior brick walls remained. It took three years to rebuild the White House.
White House Facts
There are 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, and 6 levels to accommodate all the people who live in, work in, and visit the White House. There are also 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces, 8staircases, and 3 elevators.
The White House has six floors—two basements, two public floors, and two floors for the First Family.
At various times in history, the White House has been known as the ""President's Palace,"" the ""President's House,"" and the ""Executive Mansion."" President Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901.
The White House receives approximately 6,000 visitors a day.
With five full-time chefs, the White House kitchen is able to serve dinner to as many as 140 guests and hors d'oeuvres to more than 1,000.
The White House requires 570 gallons of paint to cover its outside surface.
For recreation, the White House has a variety of facilities available to its residents, including a tennis court, a jogging track, a swimming pool, a movie theater, a billiard room, and a bowling lane.

Cynology
Cynology is the study of matters related to canines or domestic dogs and regular dogs.

In English it may be a term sometimes used to denote serious zoological approach to the study of dogs  as well as by writers on canine subjects, dog breeders and trainers   and enthusiasts who informally study the dog.  

Cynology 

Cynology is a classical compound word (from Greek , kyōn, genitive , kynos, ""dog""; and , -logia) referring to the study of dogs.  The word is not found in major English dictionaries and it is not a recognized scientific discipline in English-speaking countries.
Similar words are found in other languages, such German and Dutch kynologie, and the Russian кинология, from the Proto-Indo-European , which is the source of hound.

κυν is also the source of the English word cynic, and is directly related to canine and hound.

Usage in English 

The suffix '-logy' in English words refers to a study, or an academic discipline, or field of scientific study.  English Classical compound words of this type may confer an impression of scientific rigor on a non-scientific occupation or profession.

Usage in English of the word cynology is rare, and occasionally found in the names of dog training academies, with cynologist sometimes being used as a title by some dog trainers or handlers. People who informally study the dog may refer to themselves as 'cynologists' to imply serious study or scientific work.

The study of dogs 

Studies of dogs, and dog related matters, are carried out and published: in general, by those who have mastered the relevant literature or aspects of it, and the formal structure of the subject (National and International Kennel Club breeding, health, and show regulations etc.); in specific, by biologists, geneticists, zoologists, behaviourists, and others scientists, historians, veterinarians and breed specialists.

Informally, dogs may be studied by those with no specific scientific training, such as publicists and authors, breeders, trainers, police dog handlers, animal communicators and others, through literature, history,and personal experience. Many useful books and videotapes for the public have been produced through informal study of the dog.
Those who, very rarely, refer to themselves as ""cynologists"", may formally or informally study such things as veterinary science, dog breeding, breed development, dog behavior and training, and the literature and history of dogs.

Usage in other languages 

Cynology, may have other connotations or use in languages other than English, see German :de:Kynologie, Dutch :nl:Kynologie and Czech :cs:Sportovní kynologie.

The very rare term cynologist in English, is generally found to refer to ""canine specialists"" such as; certified care professionals, certified show judges, breeders, breed enthusiasts, certified dog-trainers and professional dog-handlers.

*A similar word is used to refer to dog handlers and dog trainers in Russia.  
*A veterinary clinic in Armenia offers a 'cynologist' to assist with dog training. 
*A magazine in the Baltic states described as 'dedicated to the development of cynology in the Baltic countries' covers dog training, dog shows, and veterinary advice (a hobbyist magazine, not a scientific journal.)
Question:
Cynology is the study of which animals?
Answer:
Domestic dogs

Opus 133: Große Fuge in F major for string quartet, Opus 134: Quartet in F-flat minor. These six works are Beethven's last major completed compositions. They are widely considered to be among the greatest musical compositions of all time. Their forms and ideas inspired and continue to inspire musicians and composers, such as Richard Wagner and Béla Bartók. The last musical wish of Schubert was to hear the Op. 131 Quartet, which he did on 14 November 1828, five days before his death. The quartets have been performed and recorded by string Quartets worldwide. One musician commented that ""we know there is something there, but we do not know what it is."" Composer Louis Spohr called them ""indecipherable, uncorrected horrors"" The musicologist Theodor Adorno, in particular, thought highly of them, and Igor Stravinsky described them as ""an absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever"". Richard Wagner, when reflecting on Op.131's first movement, said that it ""reveals the most melancholy sentiment expressed in music"" The quartet is considered one of the greatest pieces of music ever written by a living composer, along with the works of Mozart, Schuber, and Schoenberg. The fourteenth and final quartet are the last to be completed by the composer, and are now numbered Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Sixteenth. Of the late quartets, Beeth Ludwig's favorite was the Fourteenth Quartets, op. 131 in C minor, which was rated his most perfect work. They have been recorded by the Arturo Toscanini and Felix Weartner, among others. All of the quartets were recorded by ensembles that have recorded all of the late stringquartets by the early early 20th century, including the Alban Berget, EMI (studio 80s) and Blli Quartet Amadeus Quartet.

Mary Jane was a character created by Richard Felton Outcault ""Father of the Sunday Comic Strip"" for his comic strip Buster Brown. The style of shoe both Buster Brown and Mary Jane wore came to be known by her name, Mary Jane. Mary Janes are a preferred accessory of many traditional or folk costumes, such as those of the flamenco female dancer and of the typical woman in Mao's China and Kim's North Korea. A pump with a strap across the instep may be referred to as a ""Mary Jane pump"", although it does not have the low heels or wide toe of the original Mary Jane (and a pump is generally strapless by definition) Mr. Peanut is the advertising logo and mascot of Planters, an American snack-food company and division of Kraft Foods. He is depicted as an anthropomorphic peanut in its shell dressed in the formal clothing of an old-fashioned gentleman: a top hat, monocle, white gloves, spats, and a cane. Mr Peanut was created by a young schoolboy in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in 1916 as the commercial image for the Planters Nut and Chocolate Company. The company was later incorporated in 1916 and later incorporated two years later as the Planter's Nut and chocolate Company. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, block heeled mary jane shoes were popular in the United Kingdom and were fastened by a rectangular chrome buckle and were made under various brand names such as No Doubt, Koi Couture etc. The Mary Jane is a timeless classic of children's fashion and, for many people, a symbol of girlhood. While the classic Mary Jane still retains its wide popularity and appeal, platform style Mary Jane shoes have also evolved since the late 90s, with 8-cm to 13-cm (3-in to 5-in) ""chunky"" heels, often with exaggerated grommets or buckles. Many times the wearers would accent the look with knee-high knit socks in dark-colored stripes or patterns and/or some form of hosiery (stockings/pantyhose), and often complete the look With a plaid, pleated schoolgirl-style skirt. The shoe is a popular part of kinderwhore and Lolita fashion. Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell gave a rare glimpse into their private life. They were asked about their lack of children, her fashion choices and what it is like to be Scotland’s first female First Minister. Ms Sturgeon was also asked about her relationship with her predecessor Alex Salmond. She denied that Mr Salmond was still pulling the strings in the SNP, but said she can always go to him for advice. She contrasted their positive relationship with the “dysfunctional” one between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The Scotsman asked a lot of questions that his wife gets asked about that would not be asked of a man. The couple also spoke about their love of golf and their plans for the future. They also discussed their plans to launch a new series of TV series, The First Minister, which will air on BBC1 on Monday, April 24 at 9pm. For more information, visit the BBC website.

The number of Associate Justices is determined by the United States Congress and is currently set at eight by the Judiciary Act of 1869. Associate justices were traditionally styled ""Mr. Justice"" in court opinions, but the title was shortened to ""Justice"" in 1980, a year before the first female justice was appointed. By tradition, when the Justices are in conference deliberating the outcome of cases before the Court, the justices state their views in order of seniority. If there is a knock at their conference room door, the junior justice (who sits closest to the door) must answer it. The current junior justice is Elena Kagan. If two justices are appointed on the same day, the older is designated the senior Justice of the two. If the Chief Justice is unable to discharge his functions, or that office is vacant, his duties are carried out by the most senior Associate Justice until the disability or the vacancy ends. If a Justice dies in office, retires, or is removed from office following impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate, the senior justice takes over until a new Justice is appointed. The Chief Justice has certain administrative responsibilities that the other Justices do not and is paid slightly more ($255,500 per year for the Chief justice and $244,400 per yearfor each Associate Justice) than the other justices. The most senior justice is always considered to be the mostSenior Justice. Currently, theSenior Associate Justice is Anthony Kennedy. The sitting Associate Justicing are, ordered by seniority: Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas.

The image for this article is from the 2013 edition of The Washington Post’s ‘The Washington Post Magazine’, which is available in hardback, paperback and e-book editions. For the 2013 issue of the magazine, click here. Retired Associate Justices have the opportunity to assume duties similar to the senior status assumed by District and Circuit Judges. Retired Justices may choose to keep a set of chambers in the Supreme Court building, as well as to employ law clerks. Names of retired Associate Justice continue to appear alongside those of the active Justices of the Court on the Bound Volumes of Supreme Court decisions. Currently, there are three retired associate Supreme Court Justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter, and John Paul Stevens, who retired on June 29, 2010. As of present, Stevens has chosen not to so serve. A rash is a change of the skin which affects its color, appearance, or texture. Rashes may cause the skin to change color, itch, become warm, bumpy, chapped, dry, cracked or blistered, swell, and may be painful. Rash can last 5 to 20 days, the diagnosis may confirm any number of conditions. The causes, and therefore treatments for rashes, vary widely. Diagnosis must take into account such things as the appearance of the rash, other symptoms, what the patient may have been exposed to, occupation, and occurrence in family members. An accurate evaluation by a provider may only be made in the context of a thorough history (What medication is the patient taking? What is thepatient's occupation? Where has the patient been?) and complete physical examination. For example, the rash in measles is an erythematous, morbilliform, maculopapular rash that begins a few days after the fever starts. It classically starts at the head, and spreads downwards. Both O' Connor and Souter occasionally serve on panels of the Courts of Appeals of various circuits. The Chief Justice may be appointed by the Chief Justice to sit on lower courts if so requested and assigned. The name of the current Associate Supreme Court justice, Clarence Thomas, is on the list of names to be considered for the next Supreme Court seat. Thomas was confirmed to the position on September 14, 2013. He was confirmed by a vote of the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 13, 2013, and will take office on October 1, 2014. He will be sworn in as a Supreme Court Justice on October 2, 2014, at a ceremony in Washington, D.C. ight red lines in the skin creases of the neck, armpits and groins (Pastia's lines) The vesicles of chicken pox seem to follow the hollows of the body.

The Royal Canadian Mint ""neither endorses the product nor the method shown for the cleaning of coins"" The company now advises the use of gloves during prolonged exposure to Cillit Bang. In January 2016, Reckitt Benckiser launched its first global campaign, starring dancer Daniel Campos, starring Neil Burgess, Dan Dolan and Martin Grell. In one advert he places a copper-plated coin in one of the locations to demonstrate the product's cleaning ability to remove staining. In another advert, he places one penny in a coin to demonstrate one of its cleaning abilities to remove limescale, ground-in dirt and rust. In some countries, the product is sold under the brand name Easy-Off Bam. It is a liquid for cleaning heavily stained surfaces. It contains not more than 5% of anionic surfactants, 15-30% of sodium carbonate, sodium percarbonate (the bleaching compound), and a perfume formula containing limononene. It can cause allergic reactions in people, so the company advises theUse of gloves in prolonged exposure. The product contains two acids: sulfamic acid and phosphoric acid. It should not be used on any acid sensitive material, such as marble or enamel, aluminium, stone, zinc- plated metals, varnished, waxed or oiled wood floors, rubber, textiles or carpets. The products marketed under thebrand name include a degreaser, cleaning crystals, and a grime, rust, mould and lime remover. The company is known as Martin Garrell, known as Barry Scott in Australia and New Zealand, and Dolan Dolan, known in the UK as Dan Campos and Daniel Dolan in Australia. The brand is also known as Easy off Bang/Bam Power Grime and Lime Cleaner Trigger in the U.S. and Easy Off Bang in Canada. The British farthing (¼d) coin, from ""fourthing"", was a unit of currency of one quarter of a penny, or one nine hundred and sixtieth of a pound sterling. It was used during the reign of six monarchs: Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II, ceasing to be legal tender in 1960. It featured two different designs on its reverse during its one hundred years in circulation: from 1860 until 1936, the image of Britannia; and from 1937 onwards, a wren. The original reverse of the coin, designed by Leonard Charles Wyon, is a seated Britannia, holding a trident, with the word ""Britannia"" above. The inscription around the bust read  (abbreviated Latin: Victoria by the grace of God. queen of Britain defender of the faith). This was replaced in 1895 by the ""old head"", or ""veiled bust"". Over the long reign of Queen Victoria two different obverses were used, and the short reign of Edward VIII meant that no farthings bearing his likeness were ever issued. As of 2014, the purchasing power of a farthing in 1960 (at its demise) ranged between 2p and 7p (in 2014 GB Pound values). In 2014 the farthing was valued at between £2,000 and £3,000. The farthing is a unit that is worth between £1,500 and £5,000, depending on the value of its obverse. It is used to pay for goods such as electricity, gas, water, food, electricity, water and gas. It also cleans oil spills and also cleans spills of petrol and diesel. It has been used to clean plutonium stains at the defunct Dounreay nuclear power station in Caithness, Scotland. The product is sold as Easy-Off BAM (a brand extension of Reckitt Benckiser's popular oven cleaner) in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Mexico, and as ""Easy-Off. BANG"" in South Africa and Korea, with similar packaging and spray bottle design. The North American versions of the advertisement use the appropriate one-cent coin (a Lincoln cent in the U.S., a 1953–1964 one cent coin in Canada). Outside Europe, the product is called Cillit Bang. ist, dated 1937, but technically it is a pattern coin i.e. one produced for official approval. The obverse shows a left-facing portrait of the king (who considered this to be his best side) Regular-issue farthings of George VI and Elizabeth II feature a redesigned reverse displaying the wren, one of Britain's smallest birds. Unlike the penny, farthings were minted throughout the early reign of Elizabeth II, bearing the inscription (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen of all Britain defender of the faith) in 1953.Solid mechanics is the branch of continuum mechanics that studies the behavior of solid materials, especially their motion and deformation under the action of forces, temperature changes, phase changes, and other external or internal agents. Solid mechanics is fundamental for civil, aerospace, nuclear, and mechanical engineering, and for geology. It has specific applications in many other areas, such as understanding the anatomy of living beings, and the design of dental prostheses and surgical implants. There are four basic models that describe how a solid responds to an applied stress: Elastically, Viscoelastically, Elastically and Elastically Elastic. If a material has a rest shape and its shape departs away from the rest shape due to stress, the proportion of deformation to original size is called strain. If the applied stress is sufficiently low (or the imposed strain is small enough), almost all solid materials behave in such a way that the strain is directly proportional to the stress; the coefficient of the proportion is called the modulus of elasticity. This region is known as the linearly elastic region. It is most common for analysts in solid mechanics to use linear material models, due to ease of computation. However, real materials often exhibit non- linear behavior. As new materials are used and old ones are pushed to their limits, non-linear material models are becoming more common.

For more information, visit CNN.co/WhiteHouse or go to http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/14/science/white-house-fact-monster-fact.html. The White House is located on the Potomac River, midway between the northern and southern states. It was designed by Pierre L'Enfant, a city planner from France, in the late 1700s. The streets and parks that exist in Washington today are the result of the work of two surveyors, Andrew Ellicott and Benjamin Banneker, who made maps and plans based on L'enfant's original designs. The city was named after George Washington, the first president of the U.S., who was assassinated in 1783. The Capitol Building is on one hill and the ""President's House"" on another hill. It is the third house that our president, Thomas Jefferson, said that our third president, Jefferson, submitted for our third designs for the president's house. The House is now called the National Gallery of Art and is located in the heart of the National Museum of American History, on the East Side of the Capitol. The National Gallery is one of the most famous buildings in the United States, along with the Capitol Building and the Washington Monument. The Washington Monument is the most recognizable building in the world. It stands on the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and the Eiffel Tower. It has been the home of President Barack Obama since 2009, when he was sworn in as president. The building is on the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution, which is the nation's oldest federal building. The Smithsonian is also home to the National Mall, which dates back to the 17th century, and was the site of the first national park. The Mall is now the center of a major tourist attraction, the National Zoo, which opened in 1909. Cynology is the study of matters related to canines or domestic dogs and regular dogs. The word is not found in major English dictionaries and it is not a recognized scientific discipline in English-speaking countries. The White House has a tennis court, a jogging track, a swimming pool, a movie theater, a billiard room, and a bowling lane. It took three years to rebuild the White House after it was set on fire by British soldiers in 1814. The kitchen is able to serve dinner to as many as 140 guests and hors d'oeuvres to more than 1,000. There are 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, and 6 levels to accommodate all the people who live in, work in, and visit theWhite House. It takes 570 gallons of paint to cover the outside surface of the house, which is 6,000 square feet in total. It is the biggest house in the U.S. until the Civil War. It has been known as the ""President's Palace,"" the "" president's House,"" and the ""Executive Mansion"" President Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White house its current name in 1901. It receives approximately 6,00 visitors a day, and has five full-time chefs. It also has two basements, two public floors, and two floors for the First Family.

Death to Spies
Released in 2007, Death to Spies () is a stealth third-person shooter PC game set in World War II and produced by 1C Company and Haggard Games. The game was released on Valve's digital distribution system, Steam, on March 12, 2008.

Gameplay

Death to Spies takes place from a third-person perspective. The player controls Semion Strogov, a captain in a Soviet counterintelligence agency named SMERSH. Strogov is able to run, jump, crouch, crawl and climb over obstacles, and he is also able to drive vehicles. Taking place in World War II, the player is required to complete various tasks in enemy territory, such as killing targets and stealing documents. Emphasis is placed on stealth, as the player is greatly outnumbered by enemy personnel, and some missions will be failed if the alarm is raised. 

The game's missions are connected by cutscenes, taking place in 1951. After the arrest of the head of SMERSH Viktor Abakumov, Semion Strogov is questioned about his involvement in a number of special operations between 1943 through 1946, as his interrogators search for any connections between him and Abakumov.

The Heads-up display shows the level of awareness and suspicion of enemies, both of which are represented with a single bar at the top of the screen and are represented separately as different icons. A vector map can be displayed on the screen, showing characters' locations and their fields of vision, in which the player will be detected either instantly or gradually, depending on the distance. The vector map also shows the radius of noises made by the player; if someone is within the radius of the noise, they may investigate the noise or become alerted, depending on the noise.

Disguises can be used to avoid alerting enemies when seen. When a character is knocked unconscious or killed without damaging the uniform, Strogov can change into their clothes. Some enemies are able to see through disguises and can be alerted if the player enters their vision, and all enemies can be alerted to suspicious behaviour which includes picking the lock of a door or looking through a door's keyhole, being in certain stances or having certain weapons visible.

Before starting a mission, the player is usually able to select equipment to bring to the mission. Strogov has a carrying capacity limited to one handgun, one long gun and 18 slots for small items such as ammunition and knives; one knife can also be stored in a dedicated slot. A backpack has space for larger items such as pliers and dynamite, and space for small items, but Strogov also has a weight limit to his inventory, and small items stored in a backpack must be moved to the 18 slots before it can be used.
A variety of firearms (along with ammunition) and explosives are available to choose from, with the choices available depending on the mission. Other weapons include chloroform, knives, a garrote and poison. German equipment can also be chosen to avoid suspicion from enemy personnel when in disguise and/or to make use of ammunition taken from enemies' bodies.

Several missions take place in allied areas. The player is forced to begin these missions lightly armed and they cannot select their equipment. However, weapons and ammunition can be found in the level.

Reception

Death to Spies mostly received above average reviews. The game has an average score of 70% on Game Rankings  and 69% on Metacritic.  GameSpot gave it a 7.0, praising its detailed level design variation and challenging missions, but at the same time noting that the game can be overly difficult at times. IGN gave it an 8.0, saying it was ""horrifically difficult at times and not without its peculiarities; Death to Spies is nevertheless always interesting and wholly addictive."" 

Sequel

On March 23, 2009 1C Company announced a sequel, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth.  It was released on August 10, 2009.

Rooster Cogburn (character)
Reuben J. ""Rooster"" Cogburn is a fictional character who first appeared in the 1968 Charles Portis novel, True Grit.

The novel was adapted into a 1969 film, True Grit, and from that a 1975 sequel entitled Rooster Cogburn was also produced.  The character was also featured in a made-for-television sequel, entitled True Grit: A Further Adventure, made in 1978. The Coen brothers released a new film version of the novel in 2010. 

In the 1969 and 1975 theatrical releases, Cogburn was portrayed by John Wayne. Unusually for Wayne, who usually portrayed straight-laced heroes, Cogburn is portrayed as a curmudgeonly antihero. The 1978 TV sequel starred Warren Oates in the featured role.  The 2010 film stars Jeff Bridges as Cogburn.

John Wayne won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Cogburn in the 1969 film. On January 24, 2011, Jeff Bridges was nominated for the same award for his portrayal of Cogburn.

Fictional character biography 

Reuben Cogburn was born on July 15, 1825. Cogburn was a veteran of the American Civil War who served under Confederate guerrilla leader William Quantrill, where he lost his eye. He was twice married, first to an Illinois woman who left him to return to her first husband after bearing Cogburn a single, extremely clumsy son, Horace, (of whom Cogburn says, ""He never liked me anyway""), and second to a Texas woman who wanted him to be a lawyer. Cogburn is described as a ""fearless, one-eyed U.S. marshal who never knew a dry day in his life."" He was ""the toughest marshal"" working the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) on behalf of Judge Isaac Parker,[http://www.rollspel.com/engelsk/western/eparker.htm Isaac ""Hanging Judge"" Parker] the real-life judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas (having criminal jurisdiction in the Indian Territory, as the bailiff repeatedly announces in both films). Cogburn shot a total of 64 men in eight years, killing 60 (not counting the men he killed after the first film of Rooster Cogburn, as then it would have been 70 shot and 66 killed). He killed 23 in four years and 60 by eight, all of whom he claimed to have killed in self-defense, in the line of duty, or fleeing justice.

In the 1969 film, Cogburn helped a headstrong 14-year-old girl, named Mattie Ross (Kim Darby), along with Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Glen Campbell), to track down Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey), the man who drunkenly killed her father. In the sequel, he teamed up with elderly spinster Eula Goodnight (Katharine Hepburn) and an Indian boy named Wolf (Richard Romancito) while on the trail of the desperado, Hawk (Richard Jordan), who had stolen a shipment of nitroglycerin from the U.S. Army and killed family members of both Goodnight and Wolf.

Cogburn lived in Fort Smith, Arkansas in the back of a Chinese dry-goods store, along with the proprietor, his friend and gambling buddy Chen Lee, and an orange tabby cat named after Confederate General Sterling Price for his entire life as a marshal.

In the 2010 film, while Cogburn demonstrated a ruthless attitude towards the criminals and fugitives he pursued, he was generally very fair with Mattie and was shown to have a distaste for what he viewed as unnecessary cruelty.  When LaBoeuf is birching Mattie for her refusal to return to Fort Smith, Cogburn demanded that he stop, and drew his pistol in threat to make LaBoeuf stop.  Later in the film, when Cogburn and Mattie witnessed two children caning a mule with sharpened sticks, Cogburn quickly intervened, cutting the mule loose and roughly throwing the two children onto the ground in retaliation.  After Mattie was snakebitten, he rode through the night, holding her, in order to get her medical care. When the horse collapsed, he mercy-killed it with his revolver and then carried her a long distance in his arms to get her to a doctor, both saving her life and proving he really had the true grit Mattie thought he did.

Cogburn's relationship with LaBoeuf was strained throughout the film, with the two arguing frequently.  Cogburn often made light of the Texas Rangers, much to LaBoeuf's outrage, and irritatedly criticized LaBoeuf's tendency to talk long-windedly. Likewise, LaBoeuf patronized Cogburn for being an ineffective drunk who routinely relents to Mattie's stubbornness. Their greatest point of contention came during an argument about their military service during the American Civil War, during which Cogburn ended their agreement of splitting the reward on Tom Chaney when they brought him back to Texas when LaBoeuf insulted Capt Quantrill. He did, however, thank LaBoeuf for saving his life when ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper was about to kill him and said he was in his debt before leaving with the snakebitten Mattie and promising to send help back.

In both True Grit films, Cogburn confessed to having robbed something after the war before becoming a marshal, a bank in his youth in the 2010 film, and a federal paymaster in the 1969. He spoke admiringly of Quantrill, with whom he served during the Civil War. Twenty-five years after the Tom Chaney hunt, Cogburn wrote Mattie Ross a letter with a flyer enclosed saying he was travelling with a Wild West show and asked if she would like to come visit him when the show came to Memphis and ""swap stories with an old trail mate"". He said he would understand if the journey were too long. Unfortunately, Cogburn died three days before she arrived while the show was still in Jonesboro, Arkansas and was buried in a Memphis, Tennessee Confederate cemetery. When Mattie arrived in Memphis and learned of his death, she had his body removed to her family farm plot in Yell County Arkansas and has visited it over the years. His gravestone shows his full name to be Reuben Cogburn, a fact which he gave freely in the 2010 version of the film (and in the 1975 sequel to the original movie before that).

The Four Feathers
The Four Feathers is a 1902 adventure novel by British writer A. E. W. Mason that has inspired many films of the same title. In December 1901, Cornhill Magazine announced the title as one of two new serial stories to be published in the forthcoming year.  Against the background of the Mahdist War, young Faversham disgraces himself by quitting the army, which others perceive as cowardice, symbolized by the four white feathers they give him. He redeems himself with acts of great courage and wins back the heart of the woman he loves. 

Plot summary

The novel tells the story of a British officer, Harry Faversham, who resigns from his commission in the Royal North Surrey Regiment just after Lord Garnet Wolseley's 1882 expedition to Egypt to suppress the rising of Colonel Ahmed Orabi. He is censured for cowardice by three of his comrades, Captain Trench as well as Lieutenants Castleton and Willoughby, which is signified by their delivery of three white feathers to him. His fiancée, Ethne Eustace, breaks off their engagement and also gives him a white feather. His best friend in the regiment, Captain Durrance, becomes a rival for Ethne.

Harry talks with Lieutenant Sutch, a friend of his father, who is an imposing retired general. He questions his own motives, but says he will redeem himself by acts that will convince his critics to take back the feathers. He travels on his own to Egypt and Sudan, where in 1882 Muhammad Ahmed proclaimed himself the Mahdi (Guided One) and raised a Holy War. On 26 January 1885, his Dervish forces captured Khartoum and killed its British governor, General Charles George Gordon. Most of the action over the next six years takes place in the eastern Sudan, where the British and Egyptians held Suakin. Durrance is blinded by sunstroke and invalided. Castleton is reportedly killed at Tamai, where a British square is briefly broken by a Mahdi attack. 

Harry's first success comes when he recovers lost letters of Gordon. He is aided by a Sudanese Arab, Abou Fatma. Later, disguised as a mad Greek musician, Harry gets imprisoned in Omdurman, where he rescues Captain Trench, who had been captured on a reconnaissance mission. They escape.

Learning of his actions, Willoughby and Trench give Ethne the feathers they had taken back from Harry. He returns to England, and sees Ethne for what he thinks is one last time, as she has decided to devote herself to the blind Durrance. But Durrance tells her his blindness is incurable and frees her for Harry. Ethne and Harry wed, and Durrance travels to ""the East"" as a civilian. 

The story is rich in characters and subplots, which the filmed versions trim. Some versions have made major changes in the story line. The best-known 1939 version is set at the time of the 1898 campaign and battle of Omdurman, but this is a future event only hinted at in the novel.

Film, TV and theatrical adaptations

This novel's story has been adapted as films several times, with all films retaining much of the same storyline. For example, the celebrated 1939 cinematic version, produced by Alexander Korda and Ralph Richardson, begins just after the death of Gordon in 1885. Most of its action takes place over a three-year period between 1895 and 1898, climaxing with the Battle of Omdurman.

In the 1929 silent version, a square of Highlanders is broken, but saved by Faversham and the Egyptian garrison of a besieged fort. Set in the 1880s, its great moment comes when wild hippos in a river attack the Dervishes pursuing Faversham. 

The films each feature a British square broken in a dramatic battle sequence. This is only mentioned in the novel, in a battle in which the square recovered. The various film versions differ in the precise historical context.

The 2002 version starring Heath Ledger is set during the 1884–85 campaign. Critics consider it to be the worst adaptation of the novel. While the British infantry square was briefly broken in this battle, the British in reality won the battle though their advance was delayed. The film version portrays their being defeated in this battle. Critics complained that the film did not explore the characters sufficiently, and had historical inaccuracies in uniform dress. The central battle is more accurately treated in the film Khartoum (1966). 

The many versions differ in the ethnicity of the Sudanese guide, Abou Fatma, who assists young Faversham in his desert adventure. For instance, in the 1977 film, he is an Arab, and in 2002 version, he is a black African. 

The enemy forces, Islamic rebels called Dervishes, of The Mahdi, are the same, as are the geographic settings of Britain, Egypt and the Sudan).

The various film versions are as follows:

Jewish mysticism
Academic study of Jewish mysticism, especially since Gershom Scholem's Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (1941), distinguishes between different forms of mysticism across different eras of Jewish history. Of these, Kabbalah, which emerged in 12th-century Europe, is the most well known, but not the only typologic form, or the earliest to emerge. Among previous forms were Merkabah mysticism (c. 100 BCE – 1000 CE), and Chassidei Ashkenaz (early 13th century CE) around the time of Kabbalistic emergence.

Kabbalah means ""received tradition"", a term previously used in other Judaic contexts, but which the Medieval Kabbalists adopted for their own doctrine to express the belief that they were not innovating, but merely revealing the ancient hidden esoteric tradition of the Torah. This issue is crystallised until today by alternative views on the origin of the Zohar, the main text of Kabbalah. Traditional Kabbalists regard it as originating in Tannaic times, redacting the Oral Torah, so do not make a sharp distinction between Kabbalah and early Rabbinic Jewish mysticism. Academic scholars regard it as a synthesis from Medieval times, but assimilating and incorporating into itself earlier forms of Jewish mystical tradition, as well as other philosophical elements.

The theosophical aspect of Kabbalah itself developed through two historical forms: ""Medieval/Classic/Zoharic Kabbalah"" (c.1175 – 1492 – 1570), and Lurianic Kabbalah (1569 CE – today) which assimilated Medieval Kabbalah into its wider system and became the basis for modern Jewish Kabbalah. After Luria, two new mystical forms popularised Kabbalah in Judaism: antinomian-heretical Sabbatean movements (1666 – 18th century CE), and Hasidic Judaism (1734 CE – today). In contemporary Judaism, the only main forms of Jewish mysticism followed are esoteric Lurianic Kabbalah and its later commentaries, the variety of schools in Hasidic Judaism, and Neo-Hasidism (incorporating Neo-Kabbalah) in non-Orthodox Jewish denominations.

Two non-Jewish syncretic traditions also popularised Judaic Kabbalah through its incorporation as part of general Western esoteric culture from the Renaissance onwards: theological Christian Cabala (c. 15th  – 18th century) which adapted Judaic Kabbalistic doctrine to Christian belief, and its diverging occultist offshoot Hermetic Qabalah (c. 15th century – today) which became a main element in esoteric and magical societies and teachings. As separate traditions of development outside Judaism, drawing from, syncretically adapting, and different in nature and aims from Judaic mysticism, they are not listed on this page.

Three aims in Jewish mysticism 

The Kabbalistic form of Jewish mysticism itself divides into three general streams: the Theosophical/Speculative Kabbalah (seeking to understand and describe the divine realm), the Meditative/Ecstatic Kabbalah (seeking to achieve a mystical union with God), and the Practical/Magical Kabbalah (seeking to theurgically alter the divine realms and the World). These three different, but inter-relating, methods or aims of mystical involvement are also found throughout the other pre-Kabbalistic and post-Kabbalistic stages in Jewish mystical development, as three general typologies. As in Kabbalah, the same text can contain aspects of all three approaches, though the three streams often distill into three separate literatures under the influence of particular exponents or eras.

Within Kabbalah, the theosophical tradition is distinguished from many forms of mysticism in other religions by its doctrinal form as a mystical ""philosophy"" of Gnosis esoteric knowledge. Instead, the tradition of Meditative Kabbalah has similarity of aim, if not form, with usual traditions of general mysticism; to unite the individual intuitively with God. The tradition of theurgic Practical Kabbalah in Judaism, censored and restricted by mainstream Jewish Kabbalists, has similarities with non-Jewish Hermetic Qabalah magical Western Esotericism. However, as understood by Jewish Kabbalists, it is censored and forgotten in contemporary times because without the requisite purity and holy motive, it would degenerate into impure and forbidden magic. Consequently, it has formed a minor tradition in Jewish mystical history.

""Rooster"" Cogburn is a fictional character who first appeared in the 1968 Charles Portis novel, True Grit. The novel was adapted into a 1969 film and a 1975 sequel. The character was also featured in a made-for-television sequel in 1978. The Coen brothers released a new film version of the novel in 2010. In the 1969 and 1975 theatrical releases, CogBurn was portrayed by John Wayne. Unusually for Wayne, who usually portrayed straight-laced heroes, he is portrayed as a curmudgeonly antihero. Jeff Bridges was nominated for the same award for his portrayal of Cog burn in the 2010 film, which was released on January 24, 2011. Cog Burn was a veteran of the American Civil War who served under Confederate guerrilla leader William Quantrill, where he lost his eye. He was ""the toughest marshal"" working the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) on behalf of Judge Isaac Parker. He shot a total of 64 men in eight years, killing 60 (not counting the men he killed after the first film, as then it would have been 70 shot and 66 killed). He killed 23 in four years and 60 by eight, all of whom he claimed to have killed in self-defense, in the line of duty, or fleeing justice. He lived in Fort Smith, Arkansas in the back of a Chinese dry-goods store, along with the proprietor, his friend and gambling buddy Chen Lee, and an orange tabby cat named after Confederate General Sterling Price for his entire life as a marshal. His relationship with Mattie Ross, a headstrong 14-year-old girl, was shown to have a distaste for what he viewed as unnecessary cruelty. When Mattie was snakebitten, he rode through the night holding her, in order to get her medical care, and then carried her long distance in his arms to a doctor. He also helped a spinster and an Indian boy named Wolf (Richard Romancito) while on the trail of the desperado, Hawk (Richard Jordan), who had stolen a shipment of nitroglycerin from the U.S. Army and killed family members of both Eula Goodnight and Wolf. The 1978 TV sequel starred Warren Oates in the featured role. The 2010 film stars Jeff Bridges as Cogsburn. He is described as a ""fearless, one-eyed marshal who never knew a dry day in his life"" The Four Feathers is a 1902 adventure novel by British writer A. W. Mason that has inspired many films of the same title. The novel tells the story of a British officer, Harry Faversham, who resigns from his commission in the Royal North Surrey Regiment. He travels on his own to Egypt and Sudan, where in 1882 Muhammad Ahmed proclaimed himself the Mahdi (Guided One) and raised a Holy War. Harry redeems himself with acts of great courage and wins back the heart of the woman he loves. In both True Grit films, Cogburn confessed to having robbed something after the war before becoming a marshal, a bank in his youth in the 2010 film, and a federal paymaster in the 1969 film. His gravestone shows his full name to be Reuben CogBurn, a fact which he gave freely in the2010 version of the film (and in the 1975 sequel to the original movie before that) His full name was Reuben J ‘Rooster’ Cog burn. He died three days before she arrived while the show was still in Jonesboro, Arkansas and was buried in a Memphis, Tennessee Confederate cemetery. When Mattie arrived in Memphis and learned of his death, she had his body removed to her family farm plot in Yell County Arkansas and has visited it over the years. In December 1901, Cornhill Magazine announced the title as one of two new serial stories to be published in the forthcoming year. The story is about a young British officer who quits the army, which others perceive as cowardice, symbolized by their delivery of three white feathers to him. He questions his own motives, but says he will redeem himself by acts that will convince his critics to take back the feathers. In the novel, Harry talks with Lieutenant Sutch, a friend of his father, who is an imposing retired general. Most of the action over the next six years takes place in the Sudan. Harry's first success comes when he recovers after a Mahdi attack on a British square is broken by a British attack on Khartoum. His best friend in the regiment, Captain Durrance, becomes a rival for Ethne. He is reportedly briefly killed at Tamai, where the British are held. The story is rich in characters and subplots, which the filmed versions trim. The best-known 1939 version is set at the time of the 1898 campaign and battle of Omdurman, but this is a future event only hinted at in the novel. The many versions differ in the ethnicity of the Sudanese guide, Abou Fatma, who assists young Faversham in his desert adventure. For instance, in the 1977 film, he is an Arab, and in 2002 version he is a black African. The films each feature a British square broken in a dramatic battle sequence. This is only mentioned in the novels, in a battle in which the square recovered. Critics consider it to be the worst adaptation of the novel, with the 2002 version set during the 1884–85 campaign. While the British infantry square was briefly broken in this battle, the British in reality won the battle though their advance was delayed. Critics complained that the film did not explore the characters sufficiently, and had historical inaccuracies in uniform dress. The central battle is more accurately treated in the film Khartoum (1966).

"Passage:
Owen Finlay Maclaren
Owen Finlay Maclaren, MBE (1907 – 13 April 1978) was the inventor of the lightweight baby buggy with a collapsible support assembly and founder of the Maclaren company.

Early life

He was born in Saffron Walden in Essex to Andrew Maclaren and Eva (née Friend). His father died in 1914. His family descended from the Clan MacLaren in Argyll.

Design engineer

Spitfire undercarriage

He invented the Spitfire undercarriage when living in West Drayton, Middlesex when working for Maclaren Undercarriage Company Ltd. The design allowed aircraft to be steered or swivelled whilst on the ground. He retired from aeronautical design in 1944, forming the company Andrews Maclaren and making aircraft components.

Collapsible baby buggy

The former test pilot and designer of the Supermarine Spitfire undercarriage was inspired when his daughter visited from the United States with his first grandchild.  After watching the parents struggle with the clumsy conventional pushchair, he used his knowledge of lightweight, collapsible structures to create a new generation of infant transport and inspire the design of future collapsible objects such as the Strida bicycle. 

He designed his first buggy in 1965, which was built in his medieval farmhouse stables in Barby, Northamptonshire in England just south of Rugby. He applied for a patent, on 20 July 1965, for his 6lb B01 prototype with lightweight aluminium tubes receiving Patent No. 1,154,362. On 18 July 1966 he filed for an American patent, receiving Patent No. 3,390,893.

Only after this design would aluminium tubes be used in other household equipment. The buggy went on sale in 1967. He also designed the 'Gadabout folding chair' which was produced from 1961, and was commissioned by the Ministry of Health to design a larger folding buggy for larger children with disabilities called the 'Buggy Major' this buggy was designed on square tubes instead of the usual round tubes like the 'Baby Buggy', being produced around 1970.  

Today the modern version of the 'Baby Buggy' are sold in over 50 countries under the Maclaren brand based in Long Buckby.

Personal life

He was married to Marie and they had a son and daughter.

In January 1978 Queen Elizabeth II awarded him with an MBE in the New Year's Honours List.

Sussex pond pudding
Sussex pond pudding is a traditional English pudding from the South East county of Sussex. Made of a suet pastry which encases a whole lemon, with butter and sugar, it is boiled or steamed for several hours. The dish is first recorded in Hannah Woolley's 1672 book, The Queen-Like Closet.

This rich and heavy pudding has gone out of fashion over the years due to health and diet consciousness, although  the British chef Heston Blumenthal is trying to revive this type of traditional cookery.

A variant, Currant pond pudding, is known from both Sussex and Kent. 

Preparation

While cooking, the filling ingredients create a thick, caramelized sauce, which upon serving and cutting of the pudding, runs out and pools around the plate, creating a “pond”.  After cooking for so long, the skin of the lemon almost candies like a marmalade in its own juices and that of the butter and sugar.

The most authentic recipes call for beef suet for making the pastry which is available in all supermarkets in the UK, but vegetable shortening, or even cold butter, can be substituted for similar results.

The best lemons to use in this pudding are thin skinned, juicy ones that have not been waxed.

History

The first recorded recipe for the Sussex pond pudding was in Hannah Woolley's The Queen-Like Closet (1672). Woolley suggests encasing a whole apple. 

Much older cookery books and recipes do not actually call for use of a lemon at all.  Here is one found by Florence White: 

”This was given us at Chailey, Sussex, by a nursemaid in 1880 or thereabouts.  It was made for me boiled in a cloth (the correct way) in 1905 by an old cottage woman in the village of Westham.  In Sussex cottages, steak and kidney puddings are still (1931) boiled in a cloth only.” –H.J. Glover

The first recorded use of a version using a whole lemon was in Jane Grigson's English Food (1974).

In her A History of English Food, Clarissa Dickson Wright describes the pudding as requiring ""considerable flair to make"", as the cook needs to scratch the lemon ""so that its flavours burst out while it is being cooked."" She notes also that the Sussex shopkeeper Thomas Turner recorded in his diary of the 1750s and 1760s that he ate variants such as currant pond pudding and plum suet pudding.

With a fluid line-up since their founding, Vanian has been the only ever-present member.

Career

Born in Hemel Hempstead, Vanian changed his name from Lett to Vanian in early life after a previous stint as a gravedigger – Vanian being a play on ""Transylvanian"". He remains one of the early influencers of gothic fashion, wearing dark and otherworldly clothing both on stage and off. He is known to be a fan of renaissance art, film noir and horror movies, all of which manifest in his stage appearance. In November 1976, the British music magazine NME stated that Vanian ""resembles a runaway from the Addams Family"".

Personal life

Vanian has kept his personal life out of the limelight, even opting out of any input towards The Damned biography The Light at the End of the Tunnel by Carol Clerk. He married his first wife Laurie in 1977, the year after he joined The Damned, but they separated in the mid-1990s. 

He married Patricia Morrison in Las Vegas in 1996, after The Damned had performed an Australian tour. The couple have one child.

Passage:
Peter Dean (actor)
Peter Dean (born 2 May 1939) is a British actor, most notable for his role as Pete Beale in the BBC soap opera EastEnders.

Career

Dean decided on a career in acting after actress Prunella Scales witnessed him rehearsing Shakespeare in Petticoat Lane Market and advised him to take drama classes.  At 16, he studied under Joan Littlewood and has been an actor since he was 18. 

Dean's breakthrough performance was playing criminal 'Jack Lynn' in Law And Order (1978). He went on to have roles in television shows such as Minder (1979); Up Pompeii! (1971), Doctor Who (1977); Shoestring (1979); Hammer House of Horror (1980) and The Chinese Detective (1981). In 1980, he played Jeff ""Fangio"" Bateman in Coronation Street and, in 1983, he was cast as Sergeant Jack Wilding in Woodentop  (the Pilot of ITV police drama The Bill).

Film credits include: Up Pompeii (1971), Murder by Decree (1979), Sweet William (1980), The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu (1980), P'tang, Yang, Kipperbang (1982), and as a bouncer in The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle (1980).

At the invitation of producer Julia Smith, he was offered the role of Pete Beale, an original character in the BBC's new soap opera EastEnders; Dean was chosen after the actor who originally auditioned for the role (Leslie Grantham) was selected to play the character Den Watts instead. Dean played the cockney fruit and veg trader from the show's inception in February 1985 until his departure in May 1993. In reality, Dean's contract was terminated following irreconcilable differences with the show's producers. Since his departure, he has publicly slammed the producers for culling his character and did an exposé with the Sun newspaper, where he revealed some of the show's secrets and his opinions about former co-stars.  Subsequently, Pete Beale was killed in an off-screen death in episodes that aired in December 1993. Co-star June Brown (who plays Dot Cotton in the show) allegedly quit the show in protest following Dean's sacking in 1993, but returned in 1997. Brown and Dean attempted to set up a production company together, but it did not come to fruition. 

Since leaving EastEnders, Dean's television credits have been few, although he has made guest appearances on Channel 4 sketch show Bo' Selecta!, Banzai and Little Britain. He appeared in the Five television show Harry and Cosh in 2002 and regularly appears in pantomimes. In 1993 he was due to tour in the play Entertaining Mr Sloane with Barbara Windsor but left during rehearsals and was replaced by John Challis. Dean will be appearing in pantomime in December 2015 as the evil Abanazar in Aladdin at Harpenden Public Halls. 

Personal life

Born in Hoxton, East London, Dean was an acquaintance of the Kray twins while he was growing up. He went to primary school in Holloway and technical school at King’s Cross, where he learnt plumbing and bricklaying. He started drama lessons at 14 when his grandmother, the music hall artist Lilly Randall, realised that he was dyslexic. As a boy, Dean worked on a fruit and veg stall in Chapel Market in North London.

He has been married twice. His first marriage, which ended after three years, produced one daughter, Leah. He met his second wife, Jean, when he was 29 and she was 15; she was babysitting for a mutual acquaintance. Dean is divorced and lives in Wood Green, North London.

Dean is a practising Buddhist. This is the reason why he was always seen drinking from a pewter tankard in EastEnders, because he does not drink beer and would only drink lemonade. He also races greyhounds, although after a recent appearance on the BBC's [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03lv3dn Pointless Celebrities], there have been questions about how ethical his disposal of his retiring dogs might be.
Question:
Which character was once played by Peter Dean in Eastenders?
Answer:
Pete Beale
Passage:
Mount Arafat
Mount Arafat or Mount Arafah ( transliterated Jabal ‘Arafāt) is a granite hill east of Mecca in the plain of Arafat. Arafat is a plain about 20 km southeast of Mecca.  Mount Arafat reaches about 70 m in height and is also known as the Mount of Mercy (Jabal ar-Rahmah). According to Islamic tradition, the hill is the place where the Islamic prophet Muhammad stood and delivered the Farewell Sermon to the Muslims who had accompanied him for the Hajj towards the end of his life.

On the 9th of the month of Dhu al-Hijjah pilgrims go to Arafat from Mina, for the most important part of the Hajj. The Khutbah of Hajj is narrated and Zuhr prayer and Asr prayer are prayed together. The pilgrims spend the whole day on the mountain to supplicate to Allah to forgive their sins and to pray for personal strength in the future.

Hajj 

Arafah rituals end at sunset and pilgrims then move to Muzdalifah for a shortened Maghrib Prayer and Isha prayer and for a short rest.

The level area surrounding the hill is called the Plain of Arafat. The term Mount Arafah is sometimes applied to this entire area. It is an important place in Islam because during the Hajj, pilgrims spend the afternoon there on the ninth day of Dhul Hijjah (ذو الحجة). Failure to be present in the plain of Arafat on the required day invalidates the pilgrimage.

Since late 2010, this place is served by Mecca Metro. On a normal Hajj, it would be around 13 mi to walk.

In literature 

The hill is also referenced in James Joyce's novel Finnegans Wake.
Question:
Mashair Railway that opened in 2010 connecting the sites of Mina, Muzdalifah and Mount Arafat serves the visitors of what city?
Answer:
Mecca (metro)

Etymology for “Mc‑” and “O’‑” prefix in surnames
6
There is clearly a prefix in names like McDonald, McChrystal, O’Brian, O’Neal.
What does this Mc- and O- prefix signify? It looks like Donald, Chrystal, Brian, Neal are perfectly fine names on their own, so why is there a prefix before it?
  
 
You forgot to mention another prefix for names, that is ""Fitz"" as in Fitzgerald. It also means ""son of"" and it clearly shows noble French Norman ancestry. –  Paola Sep 14 '12 at 19:54

@Paola: ""fitz"" can be derived from Norman French, true, but that does not mean someone with a surname in Fitz- necessarily has Norman, French, or noble ancestry. –  Marthaª Nov 1 '12 at 13:21
  
 
@Marthaª Fitz was used for bastard-names, so FitzRoy was a natural son of the king .  There are also various sorts of FitzWhatevers, like FitzWilliam or FitzCharles or FitzClarence — all originally “illegitimate” children, but sometimes not forever staying that way. –  tchrist♦ Dec 7 '14 at 23:56
The standard way to form a name using a simple patronymic byname for men is:
    <single given name> mac <father's given name (in genitive case & sometimes lenited)>
which means
    <given name> son <of father's given name>
For example, Donnchadh who is the son of Fearchar mac Domhnaill would be:
    Donnchadh mac Fearchair
The standard way to form a name using an Irish clan affiliation byname for men is:
    <single given name> Ó <eponymous clan ancestor's name (in genitive case)>
which means
  <given name> male descendant <of eponymous clan ancestor>
For example, Donnchadh who is the son of Fearchar Ó Conchobhair would be:
    Donnchadh Ó Conchobhair
which means
    Donnchadh male descendant of Conchobhar
Two common misconceptions are (1) that Mac means ""son of"" — it actually means just ""son"", and the ""of"" comes from putting the father's name into the possessive case; and (2) that Mc is Irish while Mac is Scottish (or vice versa) — actually, Mc and Mac are two ways to write the same thing, and both occur in names from both countries. (What is true is that O' is almost exclusively Irish; despite the romantic notions we have of Scottish clans, they didn't use their clan affiliation in their names.)
Edit: as for why the prefix is used even though the prefix-less names look perfectly fine on their own, this is basically Gaelic grammar and thus out of scope for this site. Suffice it to say, some languages are fine with unmarked patronymics — names that identify the bearer's father using the unmodified given name — but Gaelic is not one of them.

I found the following quote which could be helpful. It is from David Booth's (1766-1846) book: An Analytical Dictionary of the English Language.
""Words in ITE very generally denote one of a tribe or nation, and as such may be taken substantively, and have the plural. The Old Testament is full of such denominations, such as the Hittites, the Midianites, &c. Like the ides of Homer, they bore the name of their ancestor. The Israelites were the children of Israel, as the Danaides were of Danaus ; in the same manner as the MAC (son) of the Irish, refers to the father of the tribe, to whose name the syllable is prefixed. Such PATRONYMICS (father-names), as they are called, exist among all nations.""

","['Baby Buggy', 'Baby buggy']",3768,triviaqa,en,,2ad896f5d818f0b4b4de7127fbbd66210484e842ce60aeba," Sussex pond pudding is a traditional English pudding from the South East county of Sussex. Made of a suet pastry which encases a whole lemon, with butter and sugar, it is boiled or steamed for several hours. First recorded recipe for the Sussex pond pudding was in Hannah Woolley's The Queen-Like Closet (1672). Woolley suggests encasing a whole apple. A variant, Currant pond pudding, is known from both Sussex and Kent. The best lemons to use in this pudding are thin skinned, juicy ones that have not been waxed. The most authentic recipes call for beef suet for making the pastry which is available in all supermarkets in the UK, but vegetable shortening, or even cold butter, can be substituted for similar results. The rich and heavy pudding has gone out of fashion over the years due to health and diet consciousness, although the British chef Heston Blumenthal is trying to revive this type of traditional cookery. In Sussex cottages, steak and kidney puddings are still (1931) boiled in a cloth only. In England, a bull of this breed has reached a weight of 2 tonnes. The Charolais is the second-most common cattle breed in France after the Holstein and the most common beef breed, ahead of the Limousin. The breed was introduced to the southern United States from Mexico in 1946. In 1965 it was introduced in the northern New England states from Canada    The Damned were the first British punk band to release a single, a single in 1976 in London, and have a record on the UK charts, and touet an album, an album and a single on the US charts. The world population is estimated at about 730,000, of which 37 countries are reported from the Czech Republic and Mexico. The populations of both breeds are both breeds of 'S' and 'An'Surat al-Surat, which means 'Surat' or 'Sural' in the Czech and 'Suram' in English.

Peter Dean is most notable for his role as Pete Beale in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. He is also the second woman ever to solely write the screenplay for a Disney film since Linda Woolverton wrote Beauty and The Beast in 1991. His breakthrough performance was playing criminal 'Jack Lynn' in Law And Order (1978). He went on to have roles in television shows such as Up Pompeii! (1971), Doctor Who (1977); Shoestring (1979); Hammer House of Horror (1980) and The Chinese Detective (1981). In 1980, he played Jeff ""Fangio"" Bateman in Coronation Street. In 1983, he was cast as Sergeant Jack Wilding in Woodentop (the Pilot of ITV police drama The Bill). He has also appeared in The Great Rock Swindle (1980), Sweet William Fi Fi, The Yang Man, Fu Man P'tang, Kipperbang (1982), and as a bouncer in The great rock 'n Roll Swindle. He was chosen after the producer of the BBC's new soap opera, Julia Smith, invited him to audition for the role of an original character in the show. He has been an actor since he was 18. His career has never.been the same. He currently lives in London with his wife and two children. He also has a daughter, a son, and a step-daughter. He lives with his girlfriend in London. Dean played the cockney fruit and veg trader from the show's inception in February 1985 until his departure in May 1993. In reality, Dean's contract was terminated following irreconcilable differences with the show’s producers. Dean will be appearing in pantomime in December 2015 as the evil Abanazar in Aladdin at Harpenden Public Halls. Dean is a practising Buddhist. His first marriage ended after three years, produced one daughter, Leah. He met his second wife, Jean, when he was 29 and she was 15; she was babysitting for a mutual acquaintance. He is divorced and lives in Wood Green, North London. He appeared in the Five television show Harry and Cosh in 2002. In 1993 he was due to tour in the play Entertaining Mr Sloane with Barbara Windsor but left during rehearsals and was replaced by John Challis.

It is an important place in Islam because during the afternoon there on the ninth day of Dhulul Hijjah pilgrims go to Arafat from Mina. Since late 2010, this place is served by Mecca Metro. The Khutbah of Hajj is narrated and Zuhr prayer and Asr prayer are prayed together. The pilgrimage is the most important part of the month of Dhu al-Hijjah. The day of the pilgrimage is required to be present in the plain of Ara Fatah on the 9th of the week of the holy month of Ramadan. The most important place to visit is Muzdalifah for a shortened Maghrib Prayer and Isha prayer and for a short rest on the 10th day. The 9th day is the final day of HajJ. The Hajj ends at sunset and pilgrims then move to Muz Dalifah to continue their journey to the holy city of Mecca. The journey is called the ‘Majj’ and it is the longest in the world. Mashair Railway opened in 2010 connecting the sites of Mina, Muzdalifah and Mount Arafat. The standard way to form a name using an Irish clan affiliation byname for men is: <single given name> Ó <eponymous clan ancestor's name (in genitive case)> This is basically Gaelic grammar and thus out of scope for this site. Some languages are fine with unmarked patronymics — names that identify the bearer's father using the unmodified given name — but Gaelic is not one of them. There is clearly a prefix in names like McDonald, McChrystal, O’Brian, O'Neal. What does this Mc- and O- prefix signify? It looks like Donald, Chrystal,. Brian, Neal are perfectly fine names on their own, so why is there a prefix before it? ""Fitz"" as in Fitzgerald. It also means ""son of"" and it clearly shows noble French Norman ancestry. ""fitz"" can be derived from Norman French, true, but that does not mean someone with a surname in Fitz- necessarily has Norman, French, or noble ancestry. It is true is that O' is almost exclusively Irish; despite the romantic notions we have of Scottish clans, they didn't use their clan affiliation in their names. It's true that Mc is Irish while Mac is Scottish (or vice versa) — actually, Mc and Mac are two ways to write the same thing, and both occur in names from both countries. The full Old Testament is the Hittites, the Midianites, and the Israelites. Like Homer, they bore the name of their ancestor. The Israelites were the children of Israel, the Danaides of Danaus of the Irish, refers to the father of the tribe, in the same manner as the MAC (son of) the Irish. The Hittite is generally one of one of a tribe or nation, and as such may generally be taken substantively and have the plural of such denominations, such as the Midcides of Homer, the Homerids, the Annes, & the Midlothianites. They are called PATRONYMICS (father-names), as they are called among all nations, among which they exist, all called ""Michele"" (pronounced ""michele""). The Israelite is called ""Danaus"" or ""Danius"" in Hebrew, and is the same as the Irish name ""Mac"" in English."

Laurence Kerr Olivier,  Baron Olivier of Brighton
Olivier, Laurence Kerr, Baron Olivier of Brighton (ōlĭvˈē-āˌ) [ key ], 1907–89, English actor, director, and producer. He made his stage debut at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1922 and soon achieved renown through his work with the Old Vic company. Noted for his remarkable versatility and striking features, he enjoyed universal admiration for his work in the classics, in modern realistic plays, and in comedy. His films include Wuthering Heights (1939), Rebecca (1940), Pride and Prejudice (1940), Henry V (1944), Richard III (1956), The Entertainer (1960), Othello (1965), and Three Sisters (1970). In 1948 he won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Hamlet in the film that he also produced and directed. In 1962, Olivier was appointed director of the National Theatre of England, which became one of the finest repertory companies in the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, he was a highly prized character actor, appearing in such roles as the Nazi villain in The Marathon Man (1976). Olivier was knighted in 1947 and in 1970 was made a life peer, the first actor to be so honored.
Olivier often costarred on stage and screen with his second wife, Vivien Leigh, 1913–67, a delicate brunette who made a spectacular American film debut in Gone with the Wind (1939), winning the Academy Award. She followed this with Waterloo Bridge (1940), Lady Hamilton (with Olivier as Nelson, 1941), and A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), for which she won a second Academy Award.

Shirley Crabtree
Shirley Crabtree, Jr (14 November 1930 – 2 December 1997), better known as Big Daddy, was an English professional wrestler with a record-breaking 64 inch chest. He worked for Joint Promotions and the British Wrestling Federation. Initially a villain, he teamed with Giant Haystacks. He later became a fan favourite, working until the 1990s.

Professional wrestling career 

Early career

Crabtree decided to follow in the footsteps of his father, Shirley Crabtree, Sr., becoming a professional wrestler in 1952. He first became popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a blue-eye billed as ""Blond Adonis Shirley Crabtree."" He won the European Heavyweight Championship in Joint Promotions and a disputed branch of the British Heavyweight title in the independent British Wrestling Federation before he quit in 1966 following a (non-kayfabe) campaign of harassment by former champion Bert Assirati. He retired for roughly six years.

Comeback

In 1972, Crabtree returned to Joint Promotions as a villain with a gimmick of The Battling Guardsman based on his former service with the Coldstream. It was during this period that he made his first appearances on World of Sport on ITV.

Not long afterwards, Shirley's brother, Max, was appointed as Northern area booker with Joint Promotions and began to transform Crabtree into the persona for which he would be best remembered. Based originally on the character of the same name played by actor Burl Ives in the first screen adaptation of Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), 'Big Daddy' was first given life by Crabtree in late 1974, initially still as a villain. The character's leotards were emblazoned with just a large ""D"" and were fashioned by his wife Eunice from their chintz sofa. The character first gained attention in mid-1975 when he formed a tag team with TV newcomer Giant Haystacks. However, during this period, Daddy began to be cheered for the first time since his comeback when he entered into a feud with masked villain Kendo Nagasaki, especially when he unmasked Nagasaki during a televised contest from Solihull in December 1975 (although the unmasked Nagasaki quickly won the bout moments later).

By the middle of 1977, Daddy had completed his transformation into a blue eye, a change cemented by the breakdown of his tag team with Haystacks and a subsequent feud between the two which would last until the early 1990s. A firm fans' favourite particularly amongst children, Big Daddy came to the ring in either a sequinned cape or a Union Flag jacket and top hat. In addition to his feud with Haystacks, Daddy also feuded with Canadian wrestler 'Mighty' John Quinn. He headlined Wembley Arena with singles matches against Quinn in 1979 and Haystacks in 1981. Later in the 1980s he feuded with Dave ""Fit"" Finlay, Drew McDonald and numerous other villains.

In August 1987 at the Hippodrome circus in Great Yarmouth, Big Daddy performed in a tag team match pitting himself and nephew Steve Crabtree (billed as ""Greg Valentine"") against King Kong Kirk and King Kendo. After Big Daddy had delivered a splash and pinned King Kong Kirk, rather than selling the impact of the finishing move, Kirk turned an unhealthy colour and was rushed to a nearby hospital. He was pronounced dead on arrival. Despite the fact that the inquest into Kirk's death found that he had a serious heart condition and cleared Crabtree of any responsibility, Crabtree was devastated.

He continued to make regular appearances into the early 1990s, but he eventually retired from wrestling altogether to spend the remainder of his days in his home town of Halifax. During his career, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Queen Elizabeth II said they were fans of 'Big Daddy'.  

Personal life 

Crabtree was a former rugby league player for league club Bradford Northern. His temper often forced him off the pitch early.  He also had stints as a coal miner and with the British Army's Coldstream Guards.

Crabtree's 64 inch chest earned him a place in the Guinness Book of Records.

His brother Brian was a wrestling referee and later MC, while his other brother Max was a booker for – and later proprietor of – Joint Promotions. His nephews Steve and Scott Crabtree also had wrestling careers – Steve wrestled in the 1980s and 1990s, billed as 'Greg Valentine' (named after the American wrestler of the same name) while Scott wrestled as Scott Valentine. Both worked as tag team partners for their uncle. Another nephew Eorl Crabtree is now a Huddersfield and England international rugby league player.

Crabtree died of a stroke in December 1997 in Halifax General Hospital. He was survived by his second wife of 31 years, Eunice and six children. 

Other media

Big Daddy had his own comic strip in Buster during the early 1980s drawn by Mike Lacey. In 1982 ITV planned to build a TV programme around 'Big Daddy' as a replacement for the popular children's Saturday morning Tiswas show. A pilot for Big Daddy's Saturday Show was shot and a series announced but Crabtree pulled out at the last moment, leaving the hastily renamed The Saturday Show presented by Isla St Clair and Tommy Boyd.

The European version of the multi-format game Legends of Wrestling II featured Big Daddy as an exclusive extra Legendary Wrestler.

A stage play by Brian Mitchell and Joseph Nixon, Big Daddy vs Giant Haystacks premiered at the Brighton Festival Fringe in East Sussex, England between 26–28 May 2011 and subsequently toured Great Britain.  Big Daddy features on Luke Haines' 2011 album ""9½ Psychedelic Meditations on British Wrestling of the 1970s and early '80s"" as the owner of a Casio VL-Tone synthesizer.

Movie Review -    - The Screen:'W .C. Fields and Me' Can Be All Bad - NYTimes.com
The Screen:'W .C. Fields and Me' Can Be All Bad
By VINCENT CANBY
Published: April     1, 1976
In his 1937 review of W.C. Fields in ""Poppy,"" Graham Greene wrote ""To watch Mr. Fields, as Dickensian as anything Dickens ever wrote, is a form of escape for poor human creatures . . . who are haunted by pity, by fear, by our sense of right and wrong . . . by conscience. . ."" This prize of escape is the major thing missing from the dreadful new film ""W. C. Fields and Me."" It holds up a wax dummy of a character intended to represent the great misanthropic comedian and expects us to feel compassion but only traps us in embarrassment.
""W. C. Fields and Me,"" which opened yesterday at three theaters, is based on the memoir written by Carlotta Monti, Fields's mistress for the last 14 years of his life. The book, written with Cy Rice, is gushy, foolish and self-serving, which is probably understandable.
To expect it to be anything else, I suppose, would be to look for the definitive analysis of the Cuban missile crisis in a memoir by a White House cook. Yet the movie needn't have been quite as brainless as it is. That took work.
First off, Bob Merrill, who has written either the lyrics or music (sometimes both) for some good Broadway shows, including ""New Girl in Town,"" has supplied a screenplay that originally may have been meant as the outline for a musical. It exhibits a tell-tale disregard for facts and the compulsion to make a dramatically shapeless life fit into a two-act form. The mind that attends to this sort of hack business would cast Raquel Welsh in the title role of ""The Life and Loves of Bliss Carman.""
Then there's Arthur Hiller, a director who makes intelligent films when the material is right (""Hospital,"" ""The Americanization of Emily"") and terrible ones when the writers fail.
Most prominent in the mess is Rod Steiger, who has been got up in a false nose and dyed hair in a way meant to make him look like Fields, which he does (sort of though he reminds me much more of the way Fields's one-time co-star, Mae West, looked in ""Myra Breckinridge."" The exterior is pure plastic, though occasionally one sees a sign of individual life deep inside the two holes that have been cut out for the eyes.
The film opens in the 1920's in New York, when Fields was already a big Ziegfeld star, and closes with his death in California in 1946, at the age of 67, when he had become one of Hollywood's most celebrated stars. In between these dates ""W.C. Fields and Me"" attempts to dramatize—with no conviction—the complex, witty actor-writer as if he were one of his own ill-tempered, suspicious heroes with a suddenly discovered heart of gold.
Mr. Steiger reads all of his lines with the monotonous sing-song manner used by third-rate nightclub comics doing Fields imitations. He also speaks most of them out of the corner of his mouth as if he'd had a stroke.
Valerie Perrine, a spectacularly beautiful woman who may also be a good actress, plays Miss Monti, who, in this film anyway, is an unconvincing combination of intelligence, patience, fidelity, sportsmanship and masochism. Perhaps because the visual style of the entire film is more or less mortuous, Jack Cassidy, who plays a flyweight John Barrymore, wears the kind of makeup that makes him look dead several reels before he actually dies.
The movie contains two halfway funny moments: a scene in which we see Fields taking a broom to a swan that has trespassed his Hollywood lawn, and the sight of Baby Harold (based on Baby Leroy, one of Fields's toughest costars) staggering out of his set-side dressing room after Fields has spiked the kid's orange juice with gin.
W.C. FIELDS AND ME, directed by Arthur Hiller; screenplay by Bob Merrill, based on the book by Carlotta Monti with Cy Rice; produced by Jay Weston; director of photography, David M. Walsh; editor, John C. Howard; music, Henry Mancini; distributed by Universal Pictures. Running time: 110 minutes. At the Criterion Theater, Broadway at 45th Street, Baronet Theater, 34th Street near Second Avenue. This film has been rated PG.

Passage:
Phyllis Latour
Phyllis ""Pippa"" Latour (born 8 April 1921) MBE, was a heroine of the Special Operations Executive during the Second World War.

Early life

Latour's father, Philippe, was French and married to Louise, a British citizen living in South Africa, where Phyllis was born in 1921.

WAAF & Special Operations Executive

She moved from South Africa to England and joined the WAAF in November 1941 (Service Number 718483) as a flight mechanic for airframes—But she was immediately asked to become a spy, and went through vigorous mental and physical training. She joined the SOE in revenge for her godmother's father having been shot by the Nazis,  officially joining on 1 November 1943 and was commissioned as an Honorary Section Officer.

She parachuted into Orne, Normandy on 1 May 1944 to operate as part of the Scientist circuit, using the codename Genevieve to work as a wireless operator with the organiser Claude de Baissac and his sister Lisé de Baissac (the courier).  She worked successfully and largely avoiding detection of the Germans, she sent over 135 messages to London, remaining in France until the liberation in August 1944.

Post World War II

Lærdal Tunnel
Lærdal Tunnel () is a  long road tunnel connecting Lærdal and Aurland in Sogn og Fjordane, Norway and located approximately 175 – north-east of Bergen. It is the longest road tunnel in the world succeeding the Swiss Gotthard Road Tunnel. The tunnel carries two lanes of European Route E16 and represents the final link on the new main highway connecting Oslo and Bergen without ferry connections and difficult mountain crossings during winter.

In 1975, the Parliament of Norway decided that the main road between Oslo and Bergen would run via Filefjell. In 1992, Parliament confirmed that decision, made the further decision that the road should run through a tunnel between Lærdal and Aurland, and passed legislation to build the tunnel. Construction started in 1995 and the tunnel opened in 2000. It cost 1.082 billion Norwegian krone ($113.1M USD). 

Design

A total of 2500000 m3 of rock was removed from the tunnel during its construction from 1995 to 2000.  The tunnel begins just east of Aurlandsvangen in Aurland and goes through a mountain range and ends  south of Lærdalsøyri in Lærdal.  The design of the tunnel takes into consideration the mental strain on drivers, so the tunnel is divided into four sections, separated by three large mountain caves at 6 km intervals.  While the main tunnel has white lights, the caves have blue lighting with yellow lights at the fringes to give an impression of sunrise.   The caves are meant to break the routine, providing a refreshing view and allowing drivers to take a short rest.  The caverns are also used as turn around points and for break areas to help lift claustrophobia during a 20-minute drive through the tunnel.  To keep drivers from being inattentive or falling asleep, each lane is supplied with a loud rumble strip towards the centre.

Safety

The tunnel does not have emergency exits. In case of accidents and/or fire, many safety precautions have been made.  There are emergency phones marked ""SOS"" every 250 m which can contact the police, fire departments, and hospitals.  Fire extinguishers have been placed every 125 m.  Whenever an emergency phone in the tunnel is used or a fire extinguisher is lifted, stop lights and electronic signs reading: snu og køyr ut () are displayed throughout the tunnel and 2 other electronic signs on both sides of the entrance reading: tunnelen stengt  (English: Tunnel closed).  There are 15 turning areas which were constructed for buses and semi-trailers.  In addition to the three large caverns, emergency niches have been built every 500 m.  There are photo inspections and counting of all vehicles that enter and exit the tunnel at security centres in Lærdal and Bergen.  There is also special wiring in the tunnel for the use of radio and mobile phones.  Speed cameras have been installed  because of serious speeding (there are very few other completely straight roads in the region).

Air quality

High air quality in the tunnel is achieved in two ways: ventilation and purification. Large fans draw air in from both entrances, and polluted air is expelled through the ventilation tunnel to Tynjadalen. The Lærdal Tunnel is the first in the world to be equipped with an air treatment plant, located in a 100 m wide cavern about  northwest of Aurlandsvangen.  The plant removes both dust and nitrogen dioxide from the tunnel air. Two large fans draw air through the treatment plant, where dust and soot are removed by an electrostatic filter. Then the air is drawn through a large carbon filter which removes the nitrogen dioxide.

In which country is the Laerdal Tunnel, the longest road tunnel in the world?
Answer:

Passage:
Alis volat propriis
Alis volat propriis is a Latin phrase used as the motto of U.S. state of Oregon. 

The official English version of the motto is ""She flies with her own wings"" in keeping with the tradition of considering countries and territories to be feminine.  However, because the feminine pronoun in the Latin sentences is often omitted and the verb form is not inflected for gender, the phrase could be translated with equal validity as ""[one] flies with [one's] own wings"" or ""[it] flies with [its] own wings"". 

If macrons are used to indicate the long vowels (standard practice in Latin dictionaries and textbooks), then the phrase becomes Ālīs volat propriīs.

The motto was written in English by judge Jesse Quinn Thornton, and its Latin translation was added to the Territorial Seal adopted by the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1854.  The motto referred to the May 2, 1843 vote by Oregon Country settlers at the third Champoeg Meeting to form a provisional government independent of the United States and Great Britain. During the American Civil War of 1861 to 1865 the motto on the state seal was changed to ""The Union.""Lansing, Ronald B. 2005. Nimrod: Courts, Claims, and Killing on the Oregon Frontier. Pullman: Washington State University Press. p. 90, 136-40, 262. In 1957, the Oregon Legislature officially changed the motto to ""The Union"" reflecting conflicting views about slavery in Oregon's early days.

In 1987, the legislature readopted the original motto, which it felt better reflected Oregon's independent spirit. The sponsors of the bill that changed the motto back to alis volat propriis included the Oregon Secretary of State and later Governor Barbara Roberts, President of the Oregon Senate Jason Boe, and Senate historian Cecil Edwards.

In 1999, after a short debate in committee, the Oregon House of Representatives took a vote on HB 2269, which would revert the state motto to ""The Union"". The bill failed to pass on a 30-30 tie vote. 

The current Oregon State Seal, which appears on the obverse of the state flag, still features the motto ""The Union.""

Passage:
Mattock
A mattock is a versatile hand tool, used for digging and chopping, similar to the pickaxe. It has a long handle, and a stout head, which combines an axe blade and an adze (cutter mattock) or a pick and an adze (pick mattock).

Description

A mattock has a shaft, typically made of wood, which is about 3 - long.  The head comprises two ends, opposite each other, and separated by a central eye; a mattock head typically weighs 3 -. The form of the head determines its identity and its use:

*The head of a pick mattock combines a pick and an adze. It is ""one of the best tools for grubbing in hard soils and rocky terrain"".  The adze may be sharpened, but the pick rarely is; it is generally squared rather than beveled.
*The head of a cutter mattock combines an axe with an adze. Thus, it has two flat blades, facing away from each other, and one rotated 90° relative to the other. The blade is designed to be used for cutting through roots.

The handle of a mattock fits into the oval eye in the head, and is fixed by striking the head end of the handle against a solid surface, such as a tree stump, a rock or firm ground. The head end of the handle is tapered outwards, and the oval opening in the iron tool is similarly tapered so that the head will never fly off when in use.  The mattock blade ought never be raised higher than the user's hands, so that it will not slide  down and hit the user's hands.  The mattock is meant for swinging between one's legs, as in digging a ditch with one foot on either side.  Tapping the handle end on the ground while holding the head  allows the handle to be removed. In the eastern United States, mattock handles are often fitted with a screw below the head and parallel with it, to prevent the head slipping down the handle; in the western United States, where tools are more commonly dismantled for transport, this is rarely done.

Uses

Mattocks are ""the most versatile of hand-planting tools"". They can be used to chop into the ground with the adze and pull the soil towards the user, opening a slit to plant into.  They can also be used to dig holes for planting into, and are particularly useful where there is a thick layer of matted sod. The use of a mattock can be tiring because of the effort needed to drive the blade into the ground, and the amount of bending and stooping involved.

The adze of a mattock is useful for digging or hoeing, especially in hard soil.

Cutter mattocks () are used in rural Africa for removing stumps from fields, including unwanted banana suckers. 

The mattock was most likely the main murder weapon when six people were killed in the brutal murders in Hinterkaifeck.

History

As a simple but effective tool, mattocks have a long history. Their shape was already established by the Bronze Age in Asia Minor and Ancient Greece.,  and mattocks () were the most commonly depicted tool in Byzantine manuscripts of Hesiod's Works and Days. 

Mattocks made from antlers first appear in the British Isles in the Late Mesolithic. They were probably used chiefly for digging, and may have been related to the rise of agriculture.  Mattocks made of whalebone were used for tasks including flensing – stripping blubber from the carcass of a whale – by the broch people of Scotland and by the Inuit. 

Etymology

The word mattock is of unclear origin; one theory traces it from Proto-Germanic, from Proto-Indo-European (see Wiktionary). There are no clear cognates in other Germanic languages, and similar words in various Celtic languages are borrowings from the English (e.g. , , ).  However, there are proposed cognates in Old High German and Middle High German, and more speculatively with words in Balto-Slavic languages, including Old Church Slavonic ' and Lithuanian ', and even Sanskrit. It may be cognate to or derived from the unattested Vulgar Latin ', meaning club or cudgel. The New English Dictionary of 1906 interpreted mattock as a diminutive, but there is no root to derive it from, and no semantic reason for the diminutive formation. Forms such as mathooke, motthook and mathook were produced by folk etymology. Although used to prepare whale blubber, which the Inuit call ""mattaq"", no such connection is known. 

While the noun ""mattock"" is attested from Old English onwards, the transitive verb ""to mattock"" or ""to mattock up"" first appeared in the mid-17th century.

Passage:
Washboard (musical instrument)
The washboard and frottoir (from Cajun French ""frotter"", to rub) are used as a percussion instrument, employing the ribbed metal surface of the cleaning device as a rhythm instrument. As traditionally used in jazz, zydeco, skiffle, jug band, and old-time music, the washboard remained in its wooden frame and is played primarily by tapping, but also scraping the washboard with thimbles. Often the washboard has additional traps, such as a wood block, a cowbell, and even small cymbals. Conversely, the frottoir (zydeco rubboard) dispenses with the frame and consists simply of the metal ribbing hung around the neck. It is played primarily with spoon handles or bottle openers in a combination of strumming, scratching, tapping and rolling.  The frottoir or vest frottoir is played as a stroked percussion instrument, often in a band with a drummer, while the washboard generally is a replacement for drums. In Zydeco bands, the frottoir is usually played with bottle openers, to make a louder sound. It tends to play counter-rhythms to the drummer. In a jug band, the washboard can also be stroked with a single whisk broom and functions as the drums for the band, playing only on the back-beat for most songs, a substitute for a snare drum. In a four-beat measure, the washboard will stroke on the 2-beat and the 4-beat. Its best sound is achieved using a single steel-wire snare-brush or whisk broom.  However, in a jazz setting, the washboard can also be played with thimbles on all fingers, tapping out much more complex rhythms, as in The Washboard Rhythm Kings, a full-sized band, and Newman Taylor Baker.

There are three general ways of deploying the washboard for use as an instrument. The first, mainly used by American players like Washboard Chaz of the Washboard Chaz Blues Trio and Ralf Reynolds of the Reynolds Brothers Rhythm Rascals, is to drape it vertically down the chest. The second, used by European players like David Langlois of the Blue Vipers of Brooklyn and Stephane Seva of Paris Washboard, is to hold it horizontally across the lap, or, for more complex setups, to mount it horizontally on a purpose-built stand. The third (and least common) method, used by Washboard Sam and Deryck Guyler, is to hold it in a perpendicular orientation between the legs while seated, so that both sides of the board might be played at the same time.

There is a Polish traditional jazz festival and music award named ""Złota Tarka"" (Golden Washboard).  Washboards, called ""zatulas"", are also occasionally used in Ukrainian folk music.

History

The washboard as a percussion instrument ultimately derives from the practice of hamboning as practiced in West Africa and brought to the new world by African slaves.   This led to the development of Jug bands which used jugs, spoons, and washboards to provide the rhythm.   Jug bands became popular in the 1920s.

The frottoir, also called a Zydeco rub-board, is a mid-20th century invention designed specifically for Zydeco music.  It is one of the few musical instruments invented entirely in the United States and represents a distillation of the washboard into essential elements (percussive surface with shoulder straps).  It was designed in 1946 by Clifton Chenier and fashioned by Willie Landry, a friend and metalworker at the Texaco refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. Clifton's brother Cleveland Chenier famously played this newly designed rubboard using bottle openers. Likewise, Willie's son, Tee Don Landry, continues the traditional hand manufacturing of rubboards in his small shop in Sunset, Louisiana, between Lafayette and Opelousas. 

In 2010 Saint Blues Guitar Workshop launched an electric washboard percussion instrument called the Woogie Board. 

Well known washboard musicians

In British Columbia, Canada, Tony McBride, known as ""Mad Fingers McBride"", performs with a group called The Genuine Jug Band. Tony is referred to as ""The Canadian Washboard King"". His percussion set-up was created by Douglas Fraser, of the same band. The washboard set-up was seen in Modern Drummer magazine, August 2014 edition.

Musician Steve Katz famously played washboard with the Even Dozen Jug Band.  His playing can be heard on the group’s legendary self-titled Elektra recording from 1964. Katz reprised his washboard playing on Played a Little Fiddle, a 2007 recording featuring Steve Katz, Stefan Grossman and Danny Kalb. Katz's washboard approach is notable as he plays the instrument horizontally. Additionally, Katz uses fingerpicks instead of thimbles.

During their early years, Mungo Jerry frequently featured washboard on stage and on record, played by Joe Rush.

Jim ""Dandy"" Mangrum, lead singer of Southern rock band Black Oak Arkansas, is well known for incorporating the washboard into many of the band's songs, notably ""When Electricity Came to Arkansas.""  Self taught Elizabeth Bougerol has made the washboard a key element of The Hot Sardines jazz band.

Cody Dickinson, a member of hill country blues bands the North Mississippi Allstars and Country Hill Revue plays an electrified washboard on a self-written track, ""Psychedelic Sex Machine"". The song is almost entirely centered around the sound of the washboard, captured by a small clip-on microphone. The sound is then sent through a wah-wah and other effects pedals to create a fresher, more innovative and up-to-date sound for the washboard. A frottoir is played with a stroking instrument (usually with spoon handles or a pair of bottle-openers) in each hand. In a 4-beat measure, the frottoir will be stroked 8 to 16 times. It plays more like a Latin percussion instrument, rather than as a drum. The rhythms used are often similar to those played on Guiro.

Actor Deryck Guyler was well known for his washboard-playing skills.

Passage:
Cell division
Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells.  Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle. In eukaryotes, there are two distinct types of cell division: a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell (mitosis),  and a reproductive cell division, whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half, to produce haploid gametes (meiosis). Meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions: homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division, and sister chromatids are separated in the second division.  Both of these cell division cycles are used in sexually reproducing organisms at some point in their life cycle, and both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.  Prokaryotes also undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission, where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cells. All cell divisions, regardless of organism, are preceded by a single round of DNA replication.

For simple unicellular organismsSingle cell organisms. See discussion within lead of the article on microorganism. such as the amoeba, one cell division is equivalent to reproduction – an entire new organism is created. On a larger scale, mitotic cell division can create progeny from multicellular organisms, such as plants that grow from cuttings. Cell division also enables sexually reproducing organisms to develop from the one-celled zygote, which itself was produced by cell division from gametes. And after growth, cell division allows for continual construction and repair of the organism.  A human being's body experiences about 10 quadrillion cell divisions in a lifetime. 

The primary concern of cell division is the maintenance of the original cell's genome. Before division can occur, the genomic information that is stored in chromosomes must be replicated, and the duplicated genome must be separated cleanly between cells. A great deal of cellular infrastructure is involved in keeping genomic information consistent between ""generations"".

Variants

Cells are classified into two main categories: simple, non-nucleated prokaryotic cells, and complex, nucleated eukaryotic cells. Owing to their structural differences, eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells do not divide in the same way. Also, the pattern of cell division that transforms eukaryotic stem cells into gametes (sperm cells in males or ova – egg cells – in females) is different from that of the somatic cell division in the cells of the body.

Degradation

Multicellular organisms replace worn-out cells through cell division. In some animals, however, cell division eventually halts. In humans this occurs on average, after 52 divisions, known as the Hayflick limit. The cell is then referred to as senescent. Cells stop dividing because the telomeres, protective bits of DNA on the end of a chromosome required for replication, shorten with each copy, eventually being consumed. Cancer cells, on the other hand, are not thought to degrade in this way, if at all. An enzyme called telomerase, present in large quantities in cancerous cells, rebuilds the telomeres, allowing division to continue indefinitely.

Passage:
Pelisse
A pelisse was originally a short fur lined or fur trimmed jacket that was usually worn hanging loose over the left shoulder of hussar light cavalry soldiers, ostensibly to prevent sword cuts. The name was also applied to a fashionable style of woman's coat worn in the early 19th century.

Military uniform

The style of uniform incorporating the pelisse originated with the Hussar mercenaries of Hungary in the 17th Century. As this type of light cavalry unit became popular in Western Europe, so too did their dress. In the 19th century pelisses were in use throughout most armies in Europe, and even some in North and South America.

In appearance the pelisse was characteristically a very short and extremely tight fitting (when worn) jacket, the cuffs and collar of which were trimmed with fur. The jacket was further decorated with patterns sewn in bullion lace. The front of the jacket was distinctive and featured several rows of parallel frogging and loops, and either three or five lines of buttons. For officers of the British Hussars this frogging, regimentally differentiated, was generally of gold or silver bullion lace, to match either gold (gilt) or silver buttons. Other ranks had either yellow lace with brass buttons or white lace with 'white-metal' buttons. Lacing varied from unit to unit and country to country. The pelisse was usually worn slung over the left shoulder, in the manner of a short cloak, over a jacket of similar style - but without the fur lining or trim - called a dolman jacket. It was held in place by a lanyard. In cold weather the pelisse could be worn over the dolman.
 
The prevalence of this style began to wane towards the end of the 19th Century, but it was still in use by some cavalry regiments in the Imperial German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies up until World War I. The two hussar regiments of the Spanish Army retained pelisses until 1931. The Danish Garderhusarregimentet are  the only modern military unit to retain this distinctive item of dress, as part of their mounted full-dress uniform. 

Ladies fashion

In early 19th-century Europe, when military clothing was often used as inspiration for fashionable ladies' garments, the term was applied to a woman's long, fitted coat with set-in sleeves and the then-fashionable Empire waist. Although initially these Regency-era pelisses copied the Hussars' fur and braid, they soon lost these initial associations, and in fact were often made entirely of silk and without fur at all. They did, however, tend to retain traces of their military inspiration with frog fastenings and braid trim.
Pelisses lost even this superficial resemblance to their origins as skirts and sleeves widened in the 1830s, and the increasingly enormous crinolines of the 1840s and '50s caused fashionable women to turn to loose mantles, cloaks, and shawls instead.

Passage:
Cape Matapan
Cape Matapan (, or Ματαπά in the Maniot dialect), also named as Cape Tainaron (), or Cape Tenaro, is situated at the end of the Mani Peninsula, Greece. Cape Matapan is the southernmost point of mainland Greece, and the second southernmost point in mainland Europe. It separates the Messenian Gulf in the west from the Laconian Gulf in the east.

History

Cape Matapan has been an important place for thousands of years. The tip of Cape Matapan was the site of the ancient town Tenarus, near which there was (and still is) a cave that Greek legends claim was the home of Hades, the god of the dead. The ancient Spartans built several temples there, dedicated to various gods.  On the hill situated above the cave, lie the remnants of an ancient temple dedicated to the sea god Poseidon (Νεκρομαντεῖον Ποσειδῶνος).  Under the Byzantine Empire, the temple was converted into a Christian church, and Christian rites are conducted there to this day. Cape Matapan was once the place where mercenaries waited to be employed.

At Cape Matapan, the Titanic's would-be rescue ship, the SS Californian, was torpedoed and sunk by German forces on 9 November 1915. In March 1941, a major naval battle, the Battle of Cape Matapan, occurred off the coast of Cape Matapan, between the Royal Navy and the Italian Regia Marina, in which the British emerged victorious in a one-sided encounter. The encounter's main result was to drastically reduce future Italian naval activity in the Eastern Mediterranean.

More recently a lighthouse was constructed, but it is now in disuse.
 
As the southernmost point of mainland Greece, the cape is on the migration route of birds headed to Africa.
Question:
In which country is Cape Matapan?
Answer:
Yunanistan
Passage:
An Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews
An Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews, or simply Shamela, as it is more commonly known, is a satirical burlesque, a novella written by Henry Fielding, first published in April 1741 under the name of Mr. Conny Keyber. Fielding never admitted to writing the work, but it is widely considered to be his.  It is a direct attack on the then-popular novel Pamela (1740) by Fielding's contemporary and rival Samuel Richardson and is composed, like Pamela, in epistolary form.

Publishing history

Shamela was originally published anonymously on 4 April 1741 and sold for one shilling and sixpence. A second edition came out on 3 November that same year which was partly reimpressed and partly reset where emendations were made.

A pirated edition was printed in Dublin in 1741 as well. Reprint editions have subsequently appeared as texts for academic study.

Plot summary

Shamela is written as a shocking revelation of the true events which took place in the life of Pamela Andrews, the main heroine of Pamela. From Shamela we learn that, instead of being a kind, humble and chaste servant-girl, Pamela (whose true name turns out to be Shamela) is in fact a wicked and lascivious creature and former prostitute, scheming to entrap her master, Squire Booby, into marriage.

Themes and style

The novel is a sustained parody of, and direct response to, the stylistic failings and moral hypocrisy that Fielding saw in Richardson's Pamela. Reading Shamela amounts to re-reading Pamela through a deforming magnifying glass; Richardson's text is rewritten in a way that reveals its hidden implications, to subvert and desecrate it.  

Richardson's epistolary tale of a resolute servant girl, armed only with her 'virtue' to battle against her master's attempts at seduction, had become an overnight literary sensation in 1741. The implicit moral message – that a girl's chastity has eventual value as a commodity – as well as the awkwardness of the epistolary form in dealing with ongoing events, and the triviality of the detail which the form necessitates, were some of the main targets of Fielding's travesty.

Recent criticism has explored the ways in which Pamela in fact dramatises its own weaknesses. From this perspective, Fielding's work may be seen as a development of possibilities already encoded in Richardson's work, rather than a simple attack.  Another novel by Fielding parodying Pamela, albeit not so explicitly, is The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and his Friend, Mr. Abraham Adams (February 1742), more commonly known as Joseph Andrews.
Question:
‘Shamela’ (1741) was a parody of ‘Pamela’ (1740). Who wrote the latter?
Answer:
Samuel Richardson
Passage:
Calcaneus
In humans, the calcaneus (; from the Latin calcaneus or calcaneum, meaning heel ) or heel bone is a bone of the tarsus of the foot which constitutes the heel.  In some other animals, it is the point of the hock.

Structure

In humans, the calcaneus is the largest of the tarsal bones and the largest bone of the foot. The talus bone, calcaneus, and navicular bone are considered the proximal row of tarsal bones. In the calcaneus, several important structures can be distinguished: 

The half of the bone closest to the heel is the calcaneal tubercle. On its lower edge on either side are its lateral and medial processes (serving as the origins of the abductor hallucis and abductor digiti minimi).  The Achilles tendon is inserted into a roughened area on its superior side, the cuboid bone articulates with its anterior side, and on its superior side are three articular surfaces for the articulation with the talus bone.  Between these superior articulations and the equivalents on the talus is the tarsal sinus (a canal occupied by the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament). At the upper and forepart of the medial surface of the calcaneus, below the middle talar facet, there is a horizontal eminence, the talar shelf (also sustentaculum tali), which gives attachment to the plantar calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament, tibiocalcaneal ligament, and medial talocalcaneal ligament. This eminence is concave above, and articulates with the middle calcaneal articular surface of the talus; below, it is grooved for the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus; its anterior margin gives attachment to the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament, and its medial margin to a part of the deltoid ligament of the ankle-joint.

On the lateral side is commonly a tubercle called the calcaneal tubercle (or trochlear process). This is a raised projection located between the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis. It separates the two oblique grooves of the lateral surface of the calcaneus (for the tendons of the peroneal muscles).

Its chief anatomical significance is as a point of divergence of the previously common pathway shared by the distal tendons of peroneus longus and peroneus brevis en route to their distinct respective attachment sites.

The calcaneus is part of two joints: the proximal intertarsal joint and the talocalcaneal joint. The point of the calcaneus is covered by the calcanean bursa.

Development

In the calcaneus, an ossification center is developed during the 4th–7th week of fetal development.

Function

Three muscles attach to the calcaneus: the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris. These muscles are part of the posterior compartment of the leg and aid in walking, running and jumping. Their specific functions include plantarflexion of the foot, flexion of the knee, and steadying the leg on the ankle during standing.

Clinical significance

Normally the tibia sits vertically above the calcaneus (pes rectus). If the calcaneal axis between these two bones is turned medially the foot is in an everted position (pes valgus), and if it is turned laterally the foot is in an inverted position (pes varus). 

*Calcaneal fracture, also known as Lover's fracture and Don Juan fracture

Disease

The talar shelf is typically involved in subtalar or talocalcaneal tarsal coalition.

Passage:
Aichmophobia
Aichmophobia (pronounced [īk-mō-fō′bē-ă]) is a kind of specific phobia, the morbid fear of sharp things,  such as pencils, needles, knives, a pointing finger, or even the sharp end of an umbrella and different sorts of protruding corners or sharp edges in furnitures and building constructions/materials. It is derived from the Greek aichmē (point) and phobos (fear). This fear may also be referred to as belonephobia or enetophobia.

Sometimes this general term is used to refer to what is more specifically called fear of needles, or needle phobia. Fear of needles is the extreme and irrational fear of medical procedures involving injections or hypodermic needles.

Not to be confused with similar condition (Avoidance behavior) the Visual looming syndrome, where the patient does not fear sharp items, but feels pain or discomfort at gazing upon sharp objects nearby.

Treatment 

Hypnotherapy 

The use of hypnotherapy which is a combination of hypnosis and therapeutic intervention, may help to control or improve the fear of sharp objects, specifically needles.  A technique called systematic desensitization exposes patients to the feared stimuli in gradual degrees while under hypnosis.  This technique has met with mixed levels of success. 

Direct conditioning 

Direct conditioning is a process used to associate desired behaviour in the subject with positive stimuli. Mary Cover Jones conducted an experiment in which she treated a patient with a fear of rabbits, by gradually moving a rabbit closer to the patient in the presence of the patient's favorite food. This continued until the patient was able to touch the rabbit without fear.  

Rare cases causing posttraumatic stress 

In rare cases, exposure to the feared object may cause posttraumatic stress disorder, which again increases the fear of the object as one also gets afraid of getting posttramatic stress. Typically, this is caused by the fear of a small fragment of the feared object getting stuck in the body after exposure.
Question:
In medicine, belonephobia is an irrational fear of what?
Answer:
Needle (disambiguation)
Passage:
Tenko (TV series)
Tenko  is a television drama, co-produced by the BBC and the ABC.  A total of thirty episodes were produced over three series between 1981 and 1984, followed by a one-off special (which was twice the length of the other episodes), Tenko Reunion, in 1985.

The series dealt with the experiences of British, Australian and Dutch women who were captured after the Fall of Singapore in February 1942, after the Japanese invasion, and held in a Japanese internment camp on a Japanese-occupied island between Singapore and Australia. Having been separated from their husbands, herded into makeshift holding camps and largely forgotten by the British War Office, the women have to learn to cope with appalling living conditions, malnutrition, disease, violence and death.

Background

Tenko was created by Lavinia Warner after she had conducted research into the internment of nursing corps officer Margot Turner (1910–1993) for an edition of This Is Your Life and was convinced of the dramatic potential of the stories of women prisoners of the Japanese.  Aside from the first two episodes, set in Singapore, which were written by Paul Wheeler, the series was written by Jill Hyem and Anne Valery.

Owing to high production costs, only the first two episodes of the first series were filmed on location in Singapore. For the majority of series 1 and 2, set in the camp, the programme was filmed in a specially constructed set in Dorset. Hankley Common was also used. 

The series takes its name from the Japanese word ""tenko"" (点呼/てんこ) which means ""roll-call"".  POWs and internees in Japanese-run camps had regular roll-calls, where they had to line up and number off or were counted in Japanese.

Major characters

The major characters who featured in all three series and the reunion telemovie were:
*Marion Jefferson (Ann Bell)—the wife of an army colonel.
*Beatrice Mason (Stephanie Cole)—a stern, officious doctor.
*Kate Norris (Claire Oberman)—a brash Australian nurse.
*Domenica Van Meyer (Elizabeth Chambers)—a vain, selfish Dutch woman.
*Christina Campbell (Emily Bolton)—a mixed-race (Chinese/Scottish) young woman.
*Dorothy Bennett (Veronica Roberts)—a young working-class housewife.
*Sister Ulrica (Patricia Lawrence)—a formidable Dutch nun.

Only Ann Bell, Stephanie Cole and Claire Oberman appeared in all thirty regular episodes plus the reunion. Episodes were missed by Elizabeth Chambers in Series 1, Emily Bolton in Series 2, Veronica Roberts in Series 1 and 3 and Patricia Lawrence in Series 2 and 3.

DVD release and books

All three series plus the Reunion Special were released in one DVD box-set in 2011 through Acorn Media UK.

Three paperback books were published in the 1980s. One covering the first series, titled Tenko, while a second called Last Tenko, covered the second and final series. The third book, written by Anne Valery, covered the Reunion. 

A book about the making of Tenko called Remembering Tenko by Andy Priestner was published in October 2012.

Britain's smallest songbird decling
Britain's smallest bird was almost wiped out by the cold weather this winter,    according to a new survey that found the number of gardens in which    goldcrests were spotted fell by half.
The goldcrest saw numbers plummet by three quarters. 
By Louise Gray
12:54PM BST 16 Jun 2010
The declines in the tiny bird, which at just 6g weighs less than a 10p piece, were seen throughout the UK and Ireland as the region battled with the coldest winter for several decades.
Across the British Isles, goldcrests were seen in 48 per cent fewer gardens between January and March than on average, with declines reaching 60 per cent in Scotland, the South West and the east of England. The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) said the reduction in the number of gardens where goldcrests were resident over the winter month was an ""early warning"" of possible major declines in the population as a whole - as gardens would be expected to be a refuge for the birds.
In winter, they visit gardens in larger numbers to feed on fat-based foods put out by householders, and in the unusually snowy and icy conditions which gripped the UK and Ireland earlier this year they would be expected to be seen in more gardens.
The BTO warned the declines in goldcrests in gardens between January and March, observed by people taking part in its year-round weekly Garden BirdWatch, suggest a crash in the population at large.
Dr Tim Harrison, of BTO Garden BirdWatch, said goldcrests were not able to carry much in the way of food reserves and as a result were vulnerable to starvation.

Passage:
Tonic water
Tonic water (or Indian tonic water) is a carbonated soft drink in which quinine is dissolved. Originally used as a prophylactic against malaria, tonic water usually now has a significantly lower quinine content and is consumed for its distinctive bitter flavour. It is often used in mixed drinks, particularly in gin and tonic.

History 

The drink gained its name from the effects of its bitter flavouring. The quinine was added to the drink as a prophylactic against malaria, since it was originally intended for consumption in tropical areas of South Asia and Africa, where the disease is endemic. Quinine powder was so bitter that British officials stationed in early 19th Century India and other tropical posts began mixing the powder with soda and sugar, and a basic tonic water was created. The first commercial tonic water was produced in 1858.  The mixed drink gin and tonic also originated in British colonial India, when the British population would mix their medicinal quinine tonic with gin. 

Since 2010, at least four tonic syrups have been released in the United States. Consumers add carbonated water to the syrup to make tonic water; this allows drinkers to vary the intensity of the flavour. 

Quinine content 

Medicinal tonic water originally contained only carbonated water and a large amount of quinine. However, most tonic water today contains a less significant amount of quinine, and is thus used mostly for its flavor. As a consequence, it is less bitter, and is also usually sweetened, often with high fructose corn syrup or sugar. Some manufacturers also produce diet (or slimline) tonic water, which may contain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame. Traditional-style tonic water with little more than quinine and carbonated water is less common, but may be preferred by those who desire the bitter flavor.

In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) limits the quinine content in tonic water to 83 ppm  (83 mg per liter if calculated by mass), while the daily therapeutic dose of quinine is in the range of 500–1000 mg,  and 10 mg/kg every eight hours for effective malaria prevention (2100 mg daily for a 70 kg adult).  Still, it is often recommended as a relief for leg cramps, but medical research suggests some care is needed in monitoring doses.  Because of quinine's risks, the FDA cautions consumers against using ""off-label"" quinine drugs to treat leg cramps. 

Uses 

Tonic water is often used as a drink mixer for cocktails, especially those made with gin or vodka (for example, a gin and tonic). Tonic water with lemon or lime flavour added is known as bitter lemon or bitter lime, respectively. Such soft drinks are more popular in the United Kingdom and Europe than in the United States.

Fluorescence 

Tonic water will fluoresce under ultraviolet light, owing to the presence of quinine. In fact, the sensitivity of quinine to ultraviolet light is such that it will appear visibly fluorescent in direct sunlight.

Water Into Wine (Part One)
by Martin G. Collins

The Miracles of Jesus Christ
series:
More...
The first miracle Jesus Christ performs during His ministry is changing water into wine at a marriage feast in Cana ( John 2:1-11 ). When we compare what Christ and Moses each did with water, Jesus' miracle shows the contrast between law and grace. Moses changes water to blood, and Christ changes it into wine. Earlier, in John 1:17 , the apostle John writes, ""For the law was given through Moses, [and] grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."" Moses' turning of water into blood suggests judgment ( Exodus 7:14-17 ), while Jesus' turning of water into wine implies generosity and joy. In John 3:17 , John comments, ""For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world [what the law does to sinners], but that the world through Him might be saved [what grace does for those who repent].""
This miracle demonstrates at the earliest possible time that Christ's ministry would be one of grace and truth, as an extension and complement of the Law and the Prophets ( Matthew 5:17-19 ). Jesus had come to fulfill God's law, that is, to teach it and live it as an example of how to apply it to everyday life ( Luke 24:44-45 ).
1. Why is John's statement that this miracle was the ""beginning of signs"" by Christ so important? John 2:11 .
Comment: That we are told that the miracle in Cana is the first Jesus performed discredits the false traditions that He worked miracles during the thirty years before His public ministry. It invalidates the miraculous accounts in the apocryphal gospels, which have been excluded from the Bible because of their contradictions to Scripture and their counterfeit nature. All stories about Christ's alleged miracles done prior to His public ministry are false.
2. Why does Jesus perform His first miracle at a marriage ceremony? John 2:1 .
Comment: Jesus heaps great honor on marriage by using such an event to manifest His glory. The apostle Paul writes, ""Marriage is honorable among all"" ( Hebrews 13:4 ), but society increasingly scorns marriage, a fact clearly seen in rampant premarital sex and divorce upon demand. Like Christ's coming, a wedding is a joyous celebration.
Jesus and at least six of His disciples were invited to the wedding, suggesting that the wedding couple were concerned about the character of their guests. As His blessing and presence are essential to marital happiness, Christ must be involved in our marriages. However, those who desire His involvement must invite Him in. Had Jesus not been invited to this wedding, a serious problem would have marred the marriage feast. We can learn that couples in whose marriage Christ is involved have a great advantage in solving problems that arise later.
3. Why was running out of wine a problem? John 2:3 .
Comment: Weddings in the ancient Near East included a strong legal side, especially regarding providing the appropriate wedding gift, of which the wedding feast was a part. When the supply of wine failed at this wedding, more than social embarrassment was at stake. The bridegroom and his family could have become financially liable for inadequate wedding provisions. The seriousness of the lack of wine (symbolizing a lack of joy) helps us to appreciate the blessing contained in the miracle Jesus performed ( Ecclesiastes 9:7-9 ).
This situation relates to the common problems couples experience in marriage, even among God's people. We cannot always stop problems from developing, but we can overcome them with the help of Christ who dwells in us and therefore within our marriages ( Romans 8:10 ).
4. Why does Jesus rebuke His mother for her seemingly innocent request? John 2:4 .
Comment: When Jesus reprimands Mary, calling her ""woman"" (gunai) rather than ""mother"" (meter), He implies that He is not conforming to her authority but acting under His Heavenly Father's authority. This statement establishes that Mary, even as His physical mother, has no authority over Jesus, destroying any belief that urges us to pray to Mary to intercede for us. On the two occasions in which Mary is seen intruding in His ministry—here and in Matthew 12:46-50 —Jesus verbally moves her aside. His rebuke censures her assumption of authority she does not have. She also seems to lack the humility with which we must go to God with our requests.
Since the Father had already predetermined Jesus' agenda, Mary's request is inappropriate because she tries to determine what He should do. The Father would not have let Mary change His plan, so He had probably already inspired Christ to perform this miracle. Obviously, Jesus does not deny Mary a solution, but He does mildly rebuke her for her attitude toward Him and His purpose.
5. What does Mary's response demonstrate? John 2:5 .
Comment: On behalf of the newlyweds and their families, Mary prudently goes to Jesus to solve their wine problem, emphasizing the value of friends and brethren praying for the marriages of others. The strength of Mary's faith is exhibited when she orders the servants to follow Jesus' instructions, confirming her acceptance of what He had said to her in verse 4. She demonstrates both meekness and faith by expressing a humble attitude. This is what service to Christ is all about, living in obedience to His every word.

Potemkin Stairs
The Potemkin Stairs, or Potemkin Steps (, Potemkinsky Skhody, ) is a giant stairway in Odessa, Ukraine. The stairs are considered a formal entrance into the city from the direction of the sea and are the best known symbol of Odessa.  The stairs were originally known as the Boulevard steps, the Giant Staircase, p. 32 or the Richelieu steps. p. 119. Referencing  p. 616 p. 18, 25 p. 498 ""The Richelieu Steps in Odessa were renamed the ""Potemkin Steps""... p. 223 The top step is 12.5 meters (41 feet) wide, and the lowest step is 21.7 meters (70.8 feet) wide. The staircase extends for 142 meters, but it gives the illusion of greater length.  Karakina, p. 31 ""13.4 and 21.7 meters wide""  The stairs were so precisely constructed as to create an optical illusion. A person looking down the stairs sees only the landings, and the steps are invisible, but a person looking up sees only steps, and the landings are invisible. 

History

Odessa, perched on a high steppe plateau, needed direct access to the harbor below it. Before the stairs were constructed, winding paths and crude wooden stairs were the only access to the harbor.

The original 200 stairs were designed in 1825 by F. Boffo, St. Petersburg architects Avraam I. Melnikov and Pot'e.   The staircase cost 800,000 rubles to build.

In 1837 the decision was made to build a ""monstrous staircase"", which was constructed between 1837 and 1841. An English engineer named Upton supervised the construction. Upton had fled Britain while on bail for forgery. p. 61 Greenish-grey sandstone from the Austrian port of Trieste (now in Italy) was shipped in.

As erosion destroyed the stairs, in 1933 the sandstone was replaced by rose-grey granite from the Boh area, and the landings were covered with asphalt. Eight steps were lost under the sand when the port was being extended, reducing the number of stairs to 192, with ten landings.

The steps were made famous in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film The Battleship Potemkin.

On the left side of the stairs, a funicular railway was built in 1906 to transport people up and down instead of walking.  After 73 years of operation (with breaks caused by revolution and war), the funicular was replaced by an escalator in 1970. The escalator was in turn closed in 1997 but a new funicular was opened on 2 September 2005. 

After the Soviet revolution, in 1955, the Primorsky Stairs were renamed as Potemkin Stairs to honor the 50th anniversary of the mutiny on the Battleship Potemkin.Karakina, p. 31 After Ukrainian independence, like many streets in Odessa, the previous name – 'Primorsky Stairs' was reinstated to the stairs. Most Odessites still know and refer to the stairs by their Soviet name.

Duke de Richelieu Monument

At the top of the stairs is the Duke de Richelieu Monument, depicting Odessa's first Mayor.  The Roman-toga figure was designed by the Russian sculptor, Ivan Petrovich Martos (1754–1835). The statue was cast in bronze by Yefimov and unveiled in 1826. It is the first monument erected in the city. Herlihy, p. 21

The Storm on the Sea of Galilee
The Storm on the Sea of Galilee is a painting from 1633 by the Dutch Golden Age painter Rembrandt van Rijn that was in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts, United States, prior to being stolen in 1990. The painting depicts the miracle of Jesus calming the storm on the Sea of Galilee, as depicted in the fourth chapter of the Gospel of Mark in the New Testament of the Christian Bible.   It is Rembrandt's only seascape.

Theft

On the morning of March 18, 1990, thieves disguised as police officers broke into the museum and stole The Storm on the Sea of Galilee and 12 other works. It is considered the biggest art theft in US history and remains unsolved.  The museum still displays the paintings' empty frames in their original locations. 

On March 18, 2013, the FBI announced they knew who was responsible for the crime.  Criminal analysis has suggested that the heist was committed by an organized crime group. There have been no conclusions made public as the investigation is ongoing. 

In popular culture 

In The Blacklist episode ""Gina Zanetakos (No. 152)"" (season 1, episode 6), Raymond Reddington has possession of The Storm on the Sea of Galilee and is arranging its sale to a buyer for the buyer's wedding. In the Complete First Season DVD, it is disc 2, Episode: Gina Zanetakos [No. 152], 5:44-46 and 40:17

The painting is referenced in the movie Trance as a stolen painting by Rembrandt.

The painting is the cover of a book called, ""Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk"" by Peter L. Bernstein.

The painting is used as the album artwork for The Struggle, the third studio album by Tenth Avenue North.

The painting makes an appearance in the video game BioShock Infinite, hanging on a wall  

In the ""Venture Brothers"" villain Phantom Limb is selling the painting to a mafioso who complains that he wanted the ""Mona Lisa"". Limb explains the Rembrandt is not only a better painting but cheaper for the footage, as it is just over double the size.

Passage:
Bledisloe Cup
The Bledisloe Cup is a rugby union competition between the national teams of Australia and New Zealand that has been competed for since the 1930s. The frequency at which the competition has been held and the number of matches played has varied, but , it consists of an annual three-match series, with two of the matches also counting towards The Rugby Championship. New Zealand have had the most success, winning the trophy for the 43rd time in 2015, while Australia have won 12 times.

History

There is some dispute as to when the first Bledisloe Cup match was played. The Australian Rugby Union (ARU) contend that the one-off 1931 match played at Eden Park was first. However, no firm evidence has been produced to support this claim, and minutes from a New Zealand union management meeting several days later record Lord Bledisloe wishing to present a cup for the All Blacks and Wallabies to play for. The New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) believe that the first match was when New Zealand toured Australia in 1932.

Between 1931 and 1981 it was contested irregularly in the course of rugby tours between the two countries. New Zealand won it 19 times and Australia four times in this period including in 1949 when Australia won it for the first time on New Zealand soil. The trophy itself was apparently 'lost' during this period and reportedly rediscovered in a Melbourne store room. In the years 1982 to 1995 it was contested annually, sometimes as a series of three matches (two in 1995) and other times in a single match. During these years New Zealand won it 11 times and Australia three times.

Since 1996 the cup has been contested as part of the annual Tri Nations tournament. Until 1998 the cup was contested in a three match series: the two Tri Nations matches between these sides and a third match. New Zealand won these series in 1996 and 1997, and Australia won it in 1998.

In 1996 and from 1999 through 2005, the third match was not played; during those years, Australia and New Zealand played each other twice as part of the Tri Nations for the cup. If both teams won one of these games, or if both games were drawn, the cup was retained by its current holder. The non-holder had to win the two games 2–0 or 1–0 (with a draw) to regain the Cup. A criticism of this system was that with the closeness in the level of ability between the two sides, years where each team won one game each were very common (1999, 2000, 2002, 2004) and in these years, many rugby fans felt dissatisfied with one team keeping the cup in a series tied at 1–1.

2006 saw the return of the 3-game contest for the Bledisloe Cup as the Tri Nations series was extended so that each team played each other 3 times. The 2007 Cup, however, reverted to the two-game contest because the Tri Nations was abbreviated that year to minimise interference with the teams' preparations for the World Cup.

In 2008 it was announced that the Bledisloe Cup would be contested over an unprecedented four matches, with three games played in Australia and New Zealand and a fourth and potentially deciding game in Hong Kong in an effort to promote the game in Asia (the first time Australia and New Zealand played in a third country outside the World Cup).  The Hong Kong match, which drew a crowd of 39,000 to see the All Blacks (which had already clinched the Bledisloe Cup) defeat the Wallabies 19–14,  proved to be a financial success for the two unions, generating a reported £5.5 million.  Even before the match, the two countries' rugby federations were considering taking Cup matches to the United States and Japan in 2009 and 2010. Japan hosted a fourth Bledisloe Test match on 31 October 2009. Each team is expected to clear at least A$3.8 million/NZ$5 million from the Tokyo match.  However a 2010 fourth match was set in Hong Kong and has struggled to attract crowds. 

The three-match format for the Bledisloe Cup continued in 2012, with the first two matches taking place as part of the 2012 Rugby Championship.

Boston Tea Party - iBoston.org
Boston Tea Party - iBoston.org
December 16, 1773
Three ships lay at Griffin's Wharf in Boston at an impasse. The Dartmouth,         the Elanor and the Beaver were guarded by just over twenty revolutionary         guards to prevent them from being unloaded. Yet Massachusetts Governor,         Thomas Hutchinson, the grandson of Anne Hutchinson would not permit the         ships to depart without unloading.
Lord         Frederick North, England's Prime Minister never expected this tea tax         to cause an outcry, let alone revolution. In 1767 England reduced its         property taxes at home. To balance the national budget they needed to         find a mechanism for the American colonies to pay for the expense of stationing         officials in them. Under the Townshed Act the officials would generate         their own revenue by collecting taxes on all imported goods, and once         paid affixing stamps on them. This Stamp Tax generated more in the way         of protests and smuggling than added revenue.
Why tea?
Recognizing this failure, Lord North repealed the stamp tax in 1773, except         for a reduced tax which remained on tea. This was both out of principal         to maintain the English ability to tax, and to support a national company,         the East India Tea Company, which had suffered revenue loss as nearly         90% of America's tea had been smuggled from foreign lands. This tea would         be the only legally imported tea in the colonies, and old at a discount         below customary prices to curtail smuggling.
American merchants recognized this monopoly took money from their pockets,         and resisted this tea monopoly. Merchants added to the revolutionary fervor.         Locally the agents of the East India company were pressured to resign         their posts, and ships were sent away unloaded from American coasts.
For         a decade Sam Adams had been inspiring revolution, this was his hour. Adams         is widely believed to have orchestrated the Boston Tea Party. A town meeting         was called for the evening of December 16th at Faneuil         Hall . All British eyes were on the meeting, which when it overfilled         Faneuil moved to the larger Old         South Church .
There was little notice of a committee which met with Governor Hutchinson         during the meeting, or the messenger who returned with news that no settlement         could be reached. But at that exact moment colonials disguised as Mohawk         Indians boarded the three ships.
As John Adams later noted, these were no ordinary Mohawks. They had already         organized themselves into boarding parties who easily took over the merchant         ships and demanded access to the cargo. Discipline prevented the participants         from vandalizing the ships, or stealing tea for personal consumption.         They destroyed 14,000 British pounds of tea, which equates to over one         million dollars in today's currency.
Lord North's reaction was fierce. 3,000 British soldiers were sent to         Boston, which equalled one fifth of the town's population. Boston's port         was closed except for military ships, self governance was suspended. In         order to house these troops, rights were given to soldiers to quarter         themselves in any unoccupied colonial building. The Old South Church,         the point were the teaparty was launched was gutted by the British and         converted to a riding arena and pub for troops.
By January of 1775 it was clear to Lord North that revolution was at hand.         He sent a peace making delegation offering to end all taxes provided the         colonies promised to pay the salaries of civil authorities regularly.         But it was too late. Events now overtook the hope of a peaceful reconciliation.         That spring, on April 16th the American Crisis turned into the American         Revolution, and Lord North tendered his resignation.
King George refused North's resignation, as he would for the duration         of the American Revolutionary war. Lord North would ultimately be known         as the Prime Minister who lost England's American colonies.

ITV planned to build a TV programme around 'Big Daddy' as a replacement for the popular children's Saturday morning Tiswas show. Big Daddy features on Luke Haines' 2011 album ""9½ Psychedelic Meditations on British Wrestling of the 1970s and early '80s"" Big Daddy vs Giant Haystacks premiered at the Brighton Festival Fringe in East Sussex, England between 26–28 May 2011 and subsequently toured Great Britain. ""W.C. Fields and Me"" is based on the memoir written by Carlotta Monti, Fields's mistress for the last 14 years of his life. The film holds up a wax dummy of a character intended to represent the great misanthropic comedian and expects us to feel compassion but only traps us in embarrassment. The book, written with Cy Rice, is gushy, foolish and self-serving, which is probably understandable. Yet the movie is the definitive analysis of the White House crisis in a memoir. That took Bob Merrill, who has written for either the lyrics or music for some good Broadway shows, including ""New Girl in Town,"" has supereffectively taken off. The movie, written by Cy Rice and directed by Tom Hanks, has been released in the UK and the U.S. It is available on DVD, Blu-ray and Blu-Ray, and is available to pre-order now for the first time in the US.

""W.C. Fields and Me"" attempts to dramatize the complex, witty actor-writer as if he were one of his own ill-tempered, suspicious heroes with a suddenly discovered heart of gold. The film opens in the 1920's in New York, when Fields was already a big Ziegfeld star, and closes with his death in California in 1946, when he had become one of Hollywood's most celebrated stars. The movie contains two halfway funny moments: a scene in which we see Fields taking a broom to a swan that has trespassed his Hollywood lawn, and the sight of Baby Harold staggering out of his set-side dressing room after Fields has spiked the kid's orange juice with gin. This film has been rated PG-13 by the U.S. Department of Film and TV. The Criterion Theater, Broadway at 45th Street, Baronet Theater, 34th Street near Second Avenue has a screening of the film tonight at 8 p.m. Tickets for the Criterion are available at: http://www.thecriterion.com/shows/w-c-fields-and-me- premieres-8pm-9pm.

She joined the SOE in revenge for her godmother's father having been shot by the Nazis. She was commissioned as an Honorary Section Officer. She parachuted into Normandy on 1 May 1944 to operate as a wireless operator with the codename ""Genevieve de Baissé"" She worked successfully and largely avoided detection of the Germans, but she was sent back to South Africa to be with her husband, who had been married to a British citizen living in South Africa. Lærdal Tunnel is the longest road tunnel in the world. It carries two lanes of European Route E16 and represents the final link on the new main highway connecting Oslo and Bergen. Construction started in 1995 and the tunnel opened in 2000. The design of the tunnel takes into consideration the mental strain on drivers, so the tunnel is divided into four sections, separated by three large mountain caves at 6 km intervals. While the main tunnel has white lights, the caves have blue lighting with yellow lights at the fringes to give an impression of sunrise. There are emergency phones marked ""SOS"" every 250 m which can contact the police, fire departments, and hospitals. Fire extinguishers have been placed every 125 m. There is also special wiring in the tunnel for the use of radio and mobile phones. Speed cameras have been installed because of serious speeding (there are very few other completely straight roads in the region). Large fans from both entrances expel air in both directions, and polluted air is expelled through the ventilation tunnel to Tynjadalen. It is the first tunnel to be equipped with stop lights and stop signs reading: snu og køyr ut (English: Tunnel closed). There are 15 turning areas which were constructed for buses and semi-trailers. In addition to the three large caverns, emergency niches have been built every 500 m. The tunnel begins just east of Aurlandsvangen in Aurland and goes through a mountain range and ends south of Lærdalsøyri in Lørdal. It cost 1.082 billion Norwegian krone ($113.1M USD) to build. A total of 2500000 m3 of rock was removed from the tunnel during its construction from 1995 to 2000. In 2014 at the age of 93 Phyllis Latour Doyle, """"Pippa"""", received the Chevalier de l'Ordre National de la Legion d'Honneur, (the Legion of Honour, knight class) for activities in occupied France in World War II; where was she born, and where did she grow up? The answer is: South africa. She now lives in Auckland, New Zealand. She has been married to an engineer with the surname Doyle, and went to live in Kenya, Fiji, and Australia. Alis volat propriis is a Latin phrase used as the motto of U.S. state of Oregon. The official English version of the motto is ""She flies with her own wings"" The motto referred to the May 2, 1843 vote by Oregon Country settlers to form a provisional government independent of the United States and Great Britain. In 1957, the Oregon Legislature officially changed the motto to ""The Union"" reflecting conflicting views about slavery in Oregon's early days. In 1987, the legislature readopted the original motto, which it felt better reflected Oregon's independent spirit. The current Oregon State Seal, which appears on the obverse of the state flag, still features the motto 'The Union' The motto was written in English by judge Jesse Quinn Thornton, and its Latin translation was added to the Territorial Seal adopted by the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1854. During the American Civil War of 1861 to 1865 the motto on the state seal was changed to ""the Union"" The bill failed to pass on a 30-30 tie vote in the Oregon House of Representatives in 1999, which would revert the state motto to 'the Union' In which country is the Laerdal Tunnel, the longest road tunnel in the world, located in a 100 m wide cavern about northwest of Aurlandsvangen? The answer is ""Norvège"" The tunnel is located in the north of the town of Aurland, in the province of Norweigan. The tunnel has an air treatment plant which removes both dust and nitrogen dioxide from the tunnel air. Two large fans draw air through the treatment plant, where dust and soot are removed by an electrostatic filter. Then the air is drawn through a large carbon filter which removes the nitrogen dioxide. The head of a pick mattock combines a pick and an adze. It is ""one of the best tools for grubbing in hard soils and rocky terrain"". It is generally squared rather than beveled. It has a long handle, and a stout head, which combines an axe blade and anAdze (cutter mattock) or a pick (mattock) The head is fixed against a solid surface, such as a tree stump, a rock, or firm ground. The end of the handle is tapered outwards in the iron, and the opening of the tool is similarly tapered. Mattocks are ""the most versatile of hand-planting tools"" They can be used to chop into the ground with the adze and pull the soil towards the user, opening a slit to plant into. Mattocks made of whalebone were used for tasks including flensing – stripping blubber from the carcass of a whale – by the broch people of Scotland and by the Inuit. The word mattock is of unclear origin; one theory traces it from Proto-Germanic. Mattock was most likely the main murder weapon when six people were killed in the brutal murders in Hinterkaifeck, Germany. The washboard and frottoir (from Cajun French ""frotter"", to rub) are used as a percussion instrument, employing the ribbed metal surface of the cleaning device as a rhythm instrument. A mattock (alternatively called a dibber in some countries) is used mainly for digging and hoeing, but can also be used for other tasks, such as cutting stumps from a field. The mattock blade ought never be raised higher than the user's hands, so that it will not slide down and hit the user’s hands. The use of a mattock can be tiring because of the effort needed to drive the blade into theground. The most commonly depicted tool in Byzantine manuscripts of Hesiod's Works and Days is the mattock. It is also used in rural Africa for removing stumps, including unwanted banana suckers. It can be played with spoon handles or open bottleers in a combination combination of strumming, scratching, tapping, and tapping the handle on the neck. It's used in jazz, zydeco, skiffle, jug band, and old-time music, the washboard remained in its wooden frame and is played primarily by a small wood block, but also with thimbles, or even small blocks of wood, such a small block, and even small wooden blocks. It dispenses with the metal frame and consists of the ribbing around the neck, simply of the metal ribbing and ribbing of the frame and the handle. It was used in the Battle of the Bulge, and is still used in some parts of the U.S. today. It has been used since the early 20th century. The washboard is a percussion instrument used in Zydeco and jug bands. It is usually played with bottle openers to make a louder sound. In a jug band, the washboard can also be stroked with a single whisk broom and functions as the drums for the band, playing only on the back-beat for most songs. Its best sound is achieved using a single steel-wire snare-brush or whisk broom. It was designed in 1946 by Clifton Chenier and fashioned by Willie Landry, a friend and metalworker at the Texaco refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. In 2010 Saint Blues Guitar Workshop launched an electric washboard percussion instrument called the Woogie Board. The washboard was also used in a Polish traditional jazz festival and music award named ""Złota Tarka"" (Golden Washboard). Washboards, called ""zatulas"", are also occasionally used in Ukrainian folk music. In British Columbia, Canada, Tony McBride, known as ""Mad Fingers McBride"", performs with a group called The Genuine Jug Band. Tony is referred to as ""The Canadian Washboard King"". His percussion set-up was created by Douglas Fraser, of the same band. The Washboard Rhythm Kings, a full-sized band, and Newman Taylor Baker are also known for their use of the board in their music. The instrument was invented entirely in the United States and represents a distillation of the Washboard into essential elements (percussive surface with shoulder straps) It is one of the few musical instruments invented solely in the U.S. and represents the development of Jug bands which used jugs, spoons, and washboards to provide the rhythm in the 1920s and 1930s. The frottoir, also called a Zydco rub-board, is a mid-20th century invention designed specifically for Zyd eco music. It can be played with fingerpicks instead of thimbles on all fingers, tapping out much more complex rhythms. The best way to play it is to hold it horizontally across the lap, or, for more complex setups, to mount it horizontally on a purpose-built stand. The third (and least common) method, used by Washboard Sam and Deryck Guyler, is to holding it in a perpendicular orientation between the legs while seated, so that both sides of theBoard might be played at the same time. A frottoir is played with a stroking instrument (usually with spoon handles or a pair of bottle-openers) in each hand. It plays more like a Latin percussion instrument, rather than as a drum. Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. All cell divisions, regardless of organism, are preceded by a single round of DNA replication. For simple unicellular organismsSingle cell organisms. such as the amoeba, one cell division is equivalent to reproduction – an entire new organism is created. On a larger scale, mitotic cell division can create progeny from multi-cell organisms, such as plants that grow from cuttings. A human being's body experiences about 10 quadrillion cell divisions in a lifetime. In some animals, cell division eventually halts. In humans this is because of wear and tear on the cells of the body. A great deal of cellular infrastructure is involved in keeping genomic information consistent between ""generations"" The Hot Sardines jazz band. incorporating the washboard into many of the band's songs, notably ""When Electricity Came to Arkansas."" The rhythms used are often similar to those played on Guiro. The sound is then sent through a wah-wah and other effects pedals to create a fresher, more innovative and up-to-date sound for the wash board. The rhythms are often like those played in the band’s songs, including “When Electricity came to Arkansas’’. The washboard is a key element of the North Mississippi Allstars and Country Hill Revue blues bands. The band plays an electrified washboard on a self-written track, “Psychedelic Sex Machine” The song is almost entirely centered around the sound of the washboarding, captured by a small clip-on microphone. It is also used in a number of other songs by the band, including ""When electricity came to the South"" and “I’ve Got a Feeling’,’ ” ”” “” and ‘”“,” ”, “‘’ and ”. occurs on average, after 52 divisions, known as the Hayflick limit. The cell is then referred to as senescent. Cells stop dividing because the telomeres, protective bits of DNA on the end of a chromosome required for replication, shorten with each copy, eventually being consumed. Cancer cells, on the other hand, are not thought to degrade in this way, if at all. A pelisse was originally a short fur lined or fur trimmed jacket that was usually worn hanging loose over the left shoulder of hussar light cavalry soldiers, ostensibly to prevent sword cuts. The name was also applied to a fashionable style of woman's coat worn in the early 19th century. The style of uniform incorporating the pelisse originated with the Hussar mercenaries of Hungary in the 17th Century. The Danish Garderhusarregimentet are the only modern military unit to retain this distinctive item of dress, as part of their mounted full-dress uniform. It was still in use by some cavalry regiments in the Imperial German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies up until World War I. The two Spanish Army regiments of the Spanish Army retained pelisses until 1931. The tip of Cape Matapan has been an important place for thousands of years. It separates the Messenian Gulf in the east from the Gulf of Laconian in the west. It is the second southernmost point in mainland Europe, after Cape Tainaron in Greece, also named as Cape Tenaro in the Maniot dialect. It's situated at the end. of the Mani Peninsula, which is the southernmost part of mainland Greece, and the second-largest island in the world, after the island of Sardinia. It has been called the 'Cape Matapan' since the 13th century, when it was the only point on the Greek mainland that could be reached by sea. It now has a population of around 2.5 million, making it one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. It. is located at the southern end of the Greek island of Crete, and is the only place in Europe where you can see the southern tip of Greece from the Mediterranean Sea. It also has a large population of people living in South America, where it is known as ‘Cape Tenaro’ An Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews, or simply Shamela, is a satirical burlesque, a novella written by Henry Fielding, first published in April 1741. It is a direct attack on the then-popular novel Pamela (1740) by Fielding's contemporary and rival Samuel Richardson. The novel is a sustained parody of, and direct response to, the stylistic failings and moral hypocrisy that Fielding saw in Richardson's Pamela. Reading Shamela amounts to re-reading Pamela through a deforming magnifying glass; Richardson's text is rewritten in a way that reveals its hidden implications, to subvert and desecrate it. The Cape is the southernmost point of mainland Greece, the cape is on the migration route of birds headed to Africa. In March 1941, a major naval battle occurred off the coast of Cape Matapan, between the Royal Navy and the Italian Regia Marina, in which the British emerged victorious in a one-sided encounter. The encounter's main result was to drastically reduce future Italian naval activity in the Eastern Mediterranean. The cape was once the place where mercenaries waited to be employed. The ancient Spartans built several temples there, dedicated to various gods. On the hill situated above the cave, lie the remnants of an ancient temple dedicated to the sea god Poseidon. Under the Byzantine Empire, the temple was converted into a Christian church, and Christian rites are conducted there to this day. More recently a lighthouse was constructed, but it is now in disuse. The site of the ancient town Tenarus, near which there was (and still is) a cave that Greek legends claim was the home of Hades, the god of the dead, is now a popular tourist destination. The ruins of the temple are still visible today, but they are covered by a thick layer of ivy and have been reduced to just a few feet tall. The area is also known as 'Cape Matapan' because it is where the Titanic's would-be rescue ship, the SS Californian, was torpedoed and sunk by German forces on 9 November 1915. In 1741 a pirated edition was printed in Dublin in 1741 as well. Reprint editions have subsequently appeared as texts for academic study. From Shamela we learn that Pamela (whose true name turns out to be Shamela) is in fact a wicked and lascivious creature and former prostitute, scheming to entrap her master, Squire Booby, into marriage. Calcaneus (; from the Latin calcaneus or calcaneum, meaning heel ) or heel bone is a bone of the tarsus of the foot which constitutes the heel. In some other animals, it is the point of the hock. In humans, the calciumaneus is the largest of theTarsal bones and the largest bone in the foot. The calcaneUS is part of two joints: the proximal intertarsal joint and the talocalcaneal joint. The talar shelf is typically involved in subtalar or talocalCaneal tarsal coalition. The point of calcanean bursa is covered by the calcane an burs a. The heel bone sits vertically above the tibia (pes rectus) If the calcanesal axis between these two bones is turned medially the foot is in an everted position (pes valgus) and if it is turned laterally the foot has an inverted position (pe varus) The heel is the most important bone in humans and is the only one that can be seen from the front to the back of a person's foot. It is also the most common bone to be found in the middle of a foot, in the back, and in the front of a leg. It can also be found on the front and back of the leg in the same way as the other two bones, but it is not as common as it used to be. It has the same anatomical significance as the   tibia, also known as Lover's fracture and Don Juan fracture, and the same clinical significance as  the  tibia, or    tarsa, or tarsin bone. It may also be referred to as the ""calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament"" or the ""talar shelf"" (also sustentaculum tali) It is a point of divergence of the previously common pathway shared by the distal tendons of peroneus longus and per oneus brevis en route to their distinct respective attachment sites. It gives attachment to the plantar calcane onavicular ligament, and its medial margin to a part of the deltoid ligament of the ankle-joint. Its chief anatomical significance is as a point that separates the two oblique grooves of the lateral surface of the calcneus (for the tendons) It can be found at the bottom of this article in the section on the anatomy of the heel bone. The use of hypnotherapy may help to control or improve the fear of sharp objects, specifically needles. A technique called systematic desensitization exposes patients to the feared stimuli in gradual degrees while under hypnosis. This technique has met with mixed levels of success. In rare cases, exposure to the object may cause posttraumatic stress disorder, which again increases the fear. This is caused by theFear of a small fragment of the feared object getting stuck in the body after exposure. Tenko (TV series) is a television drama, co-produced by the BBC and the ABC. A total of thirty episodes were produced over three series between 1981 and 1984, followed by a one-off special (which was twice the length of the other episodes), Tenko Reunion, in 1985. The series dealt with the experiences of British, Australian and Dutch women who were captured after the Fall of Singapore in February 1942, after the Japanese invasion, and held in a Japanese internment camp on a Japanese-occupied island between Singapore and Australia. Only Ann Cole, Stephanie Cole and Claire Oberman appeared in all thirty regular episodes plus the reunion. Episodes were by Paul Wheeler, Emily Bolton, Veronica Robert, Claire Bell and Emily Bolton in Series 1, and Veronica Robert in Series 2. The first two episodes of the first series were filmed on location in Singapore. For the majority of series 1 and 2, set in the camp, the programme was filmed in a specially constructed set in Dorset.  The series takes its name from the Japanese word ""tenko"" which means ""roll-call"".  POWs and internees in Japanese-run camps had regular roll-calls, where they had to line up and number off or were counted in Japanese. The major characters who featured in all three series and the reunion telemovie were:Marion Jefferson (Ann Bell), the wife of an army colonel.Beatrice Mason (Stephanie Cole)—a stern, officious doctor.Kate Norris (Claire Oberman)—a brash Australian nurse.Domenica Van Meyer (Elizabeth Chambers)—a vain, selfish Dutch woman.Christina Campbell (Emily Bolton)—a mixed-race (Chinese/Scottish) young woman. Three paperback books were published in the 1980s. One covering the first series, titled Tenko, while a second called Last Tenko covered the second and final series. A book about the making of Tenko called Remembering Tenko by Andy Priestner was published in October 2012. The British Trust for Ornithology said the reduction in the number of gardens where goldcrests were resident over the winter month was an ""early warning"" of possible major declines in the population as a whole. The declines were seen throughout the UK and Ireland as the region battled with the coldest winter for several decades. At just 6g weighs less than a 10p piece, Britain's smallest bird was almost wiped out by the cold weather this winter,    according to a new survey that found the number. of gardens in which  goldc Crests were spotted fell by half. The first commercial tonic water was produced in 1858. The drink gained its name from the effects of its bitter flavouring. It was originally used as a prophylactic against malaria, since it was originally intended for consumption in tropical areas of South Asia and Africa, where the disease is endemic. It is consumed for its distinctive bitter flavour and is often used in mixed drinks, particularly in gin and tonic. Since 2010, at least four tonic syrups have been released in the United States. Consumers add carbonated water to the syrup to make tonic Water; this allows drinkers to vary the intensity of the flavour. The drinks are often sweetened with high fructose corn syrup or sugar or Som Som syrup or high fructose Corn Syrup (HSFC) or sugar and corn syrup (SFC) and are often served with lemon juice or orange juice. The most popular flavour is lemon juice, followed by orange juice, pineapple juice, lemonade, ginger juice and tomato juice, with the last being the least popular. The water is usually served in a glass with a glass of red wine or white wine, with a splash of orange juice or lemonade. It can also be served with a small glass of white wine or red wine, such as a bottle of wine and a small bottle of white rum, or a small cup of wine with a large glass of wine. Tonic water is often used as a drink mixer for cocktails, especially those made with gin or vodka. Tonic water with lemon or lime flavour added is known as bitter lemon or bitter lime. Such soft drinks are more popular in the United Kingdom and Europe than in the U.S. The first miracle Jesus Christ performs during His ministry is changing water into wine at a marriage feast in Cana ( John 2:1-11 ). When we compare what Christ and Moses each did with water, Jesus' miracle shows the contrast between law and grace. Jesus had come to fulfill God's law, that is, to teach it and live it as an example of how to apply it to everyday life ( Luke 24:44-45 ). In John 3:17, John comments, ""For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world [what the law does to sinners], but that the world through Him might be saved [what grace does for those who repent].""

As His blessing and presence are essential to marital happiness, Christ must be involved in our marriages. Had Jesus not been invited to this wedding, a serious problem would have marred the marriage feast. We cannot always stop problems from developing, but we can overcome them with the help of Christ who dwells in us and therefore within our marriages ( Romans 8:10 ). The Potemkin Stairs, or Potemkinsky Skhody, are a giant stairway in Odessa, Ukraine. The stairs are considered a formal entrance into the city from the direction of the sea and are the best known symbol of Odessa. The top step is 12.5 meters (41 feet) wide, and the lowest step is 21.7 meters (70.8 feet) Wide. The staircase extends for 142 meters, but it gives the illusion of greater length. It was originally known as the Boulevard steps, the Giant Staircase, p. 32 or the Richelieu steps. p 119. Referencing  p. 616 p 18, 25 p 498 ""The Richeilieu Steps"" were renamed the ""Potemkin Steps"" p. 223. A person looking down and seeing only the stairs and the landings, the stings create an optical illusion and the person sees only the steps and landings. It is so precisely constructed that the person looks down and sees only an person looking at the stairs. It's so precise that an person looks only at the landments and sees the stairs only. A. person looks at the Stairs and sees an illusion of the Stairway and the Landings. The Stairways are so precisely. constructed that an. person looking up and down creates the illusion that the stairs are only. the stairs and theLandings. are only the st stairs. The. Landings are so. precisely constructed as to. create an Optical illusion and. the person seeing them only sees the landINGS. The landings are. so precisely designed that an individual can only see them when he or she is looking down. The Landings give the impression that they are the only way to see the land. The original 200 stairs were designed in 1825 by F. Boffo, St. Petersburg architects Avraam I. Melnikov and Pot'e. The steps were made famous in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film The Battleship Potemkin. A funicular railway was built in 1906 to transport people up and down instead of walking. The Storm on the Sea of Galilee is a painting from 1633 by the Dutch Golden Age painter Rembrandt van Rijn that was in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts, prior to being stolen in 1990. In The Blacklist episode ""Gina Zanetakos (No. 152)"" (season 1, episode 6), Raymond Reddington has the painting in his possession and is arranging its sale. The painting is referenced in the movie The 40:17 Trance as a painting by Rem brandt. The FBI announced on March 18, 2013, that they knew who was responsible for the crime. There have been no conclusions made public as the investigation is ongoing. The theft is considered the biggest art theft in US history and remains unsolved. It is the cover of a book called ""Against the Gods: The Story of The Remarkable Remarkable Risk"" by Peter L. Bernstein. The book is published by Simon & Schuster and is available in hardback and e-book. The cover price for the book is £20 ($30) and includes a copy of the book with a free digital download of the entire book for £9.99 (with free shipping).

The Bledisloe Cup is a rugby union competition between the national teams of Australia and New Zealand. It consists of an annual three-match series, with two of the matches also counting towards The Rugby Championship. New Zealand have had the most success, winning the trophy for the 43rd time in 2015, while Australia have won 12 times. The 1633 painting The Storm on the Sea of Galilee that depicts the miracle of Jesus calming the waves was stolen in 1990 from a Boston museum in what is considered to be the biggest art theft in history. The painting is used as the album artwork for The Struggle, the third studio album by Tenth Avenue North. In the ""Venture Brothers"" villain Phantom Limb is selling the painting to a mafioso who complains that he wanted the ""Mona Lisa"". Limb explains the Rembrandt is not only a better painting but cheaper for the footage, as it is just over double the size. The cup has been contested as part of the annual Tri Nations tournament since 1996. Until 1998 the cup was contested in a three match series: the two Tri Nations matches between these sides and a third match. In 1996 and from 1999 through 2005 the third match was not played; during those years, Australia andNew Zealand played each other twice aspart of the Tri Nations for the cup. If both teams won one of these games, or if both games were drawn, the Cup was retained by its current holder. A criticism of this system was that with the closeness in the level of ability between the two sides, years where each team won one game each were very common (1999, 2000, 2002, 2004) and in these years, many rugby fans felt dissatisfied with one team keeping the cup in a series tied at 1–1. The 2007 Cup, however, reverted to the two-game contest because theTri Nations was abbreviated that year to minimise interference with the teams' preparations for the World Cup. The trophy itself was apparently 'lost' during this period and reportedly rediscovered in a Melbourne store room.2006 saw the return of the 3- game contest for the BledISloe Cup as the tri-nation series was extended so that each team play each other 3 times. The three-match format for the Bledisloe Cup continued in 2012, with the first two matches taking place as part of the 2012 Rugby Championship. The Hong Kong match, which drew a crowd of 39,000 to see the All Blacks defeat the Wallabies 19–14, proved to be a financial success for the two unions. A 2010 fourth match was set in Hong Kong and has struggled to attract crowds. A commemorative blue plaque was erected by English Heritage at Dickin's birthplace, 41 Cassland Road (formerly 1 Farringdon Terrace) in Hackney in October 2015. The Dickin Medal that bears the words 'For Gallantry' and 'We Also Serve' was instituted in 1943 by Maria Dickin to honour the work of whom/what in war. Three ships lay at Griffin's Wharf in Boston at an impasse. The revolutionary guards were guarded by the Elan and the Beaver to prevent them being unloaded. Yet Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson would not permit the ships to depart without unloading. To balance the national budget they needed to find a way to pay for the cost of the tax system. In England, the tax bill for the colonies was reduced to 17.67 per cent of the national income. In New Zealand, it was 17.6 per cent. In Australia, it is 17.5 per cent, and in New Zealand it is 12.7 per cent and in South Africa it is 13.5. In the UK, it's 12.5per cent, but in the U.S. it is 11 per cent (and in the UK it is 8 per cent). In Australia it is 10 per cent; in the United States it is 9 per cent but in South Korea it is 7.5 Per cent. It is the most popular rugby union tournament in the world. It has been held by Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. It was also held by South Africa and New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s. It will be held by New Zealand again in 2015 and 2016. The first match of the 2015 Rugby Championship will take place in Sydney. The second match will be played in Melbourne on November 14. The final match will takeplace in Wellington on November 21. The third match will follow in Melbourne in November. The fourth match will taking place in Auckland on November 23. The last match will occur in Wellington in November 2014. The winner will be announced on November 25. The tournament will be known as the Rugby World Cup. The winners will be revealed at a press conference at the end of the tournament. In 1773 Lord North repealed the stamp tax on all imported goods, except for a reduced tax which remained on tea. This was to maintain the English ability to tax, and to support a national company, the East India Tea Company, which had suffered revenue loss as nearly 90% of America's tea had been smuggled from foreign lands. American merchants recognized this monopoly took money from their pockets, and resisted this tea monopoly. In 1775 Lord North sent a peace making delegation offering to end all taxes provided the colonies promised to pay the salaries of civil authorities regularly. But it was too late. 3,000 British soldiers were sent to Boston, which equalled one fifth of the town's population. The Old South Church, the point were the teaparty was launched was gutted by the British and converted to a riding arena and pub for troops. The American Crisis turned into the American Revolution, and Lord North tendered his resignation. King George North would ultimately be known as the British Prime Minister who lost the American colonies in the American Revolutionary war. He would go on to become the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the leader of the British Royal Family in the First World War. He was succeeded by Prince Charles of Wales, who went on to lead the British government in the Second World War, and later the Royal Family of Great Britain. He died in 1945, and is buried in Westminster Abbey, London, where he was buried alongside his wife, Anne, and their three children. He is survived by his son, William, and daughter-in-law, Mary, and his grandson, William III, who was born in 1775 and died in 1801. The family is now the owners of the Boston Tea Party Museum, which is located in Boston's Faneuil Hall, which was once the home of President George W. Bush. The museum is now home to the National Museum of American History and Science, which houses a collection of historic American artifacts, including the remains of President Abraham Lincoln. It is also the site of the famous White House Tea Party, which took place in 1774. The Tea Party took place on December 16th, 1775, when colonials disguised as Mohawk Indians boarded the three ships and demanded access to the cargo. They destroyed 14,000 pounds of tea, whichequates to over one    million dollars in today's currency. The party was led by Sam Adams, who is widely believed to have orchestrated the event."

What is root beer?
NEXT PAGENEXT  
The English language has lots of words that are used in two or three different ways. For example, the word ""cabinet"" can mean ""storage space in your kitchen"" or ""a group of folks who advise the president."" Beer is a word with two meanings. It can mean an alcoholic beverage made from cereal grains, or a non-alcoholic beverage flavored by root extracts. Root beer, birch beer and ginger beer are three common forms of this non-alcoholic sort of beer.
In the case of root beer, the flavoring comes from the root of the sassafras tree or the sarsaparilla vine. Originally, the root was brewed like a tea to make an extract, but now it is much easier to buy the extract ready-made.

Alpine skiing at the 1980 Winter Olympics – Men's downhill
The Men's Downhill competition of the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid was held at Whiteface Mountain on Thursday, February 14.

The defending world champion was Josef Walcher of Austria, while Switzerland's Peter Müller was the defending World Cup downhill champion and led the 1980 World Cup.
Defending Olympic champion Franz Klammer did not compete; he was not selected to the Austrian Olympic team in 1980.

Gold medalist Leonhard Stock was an alternate on the Austrian downhill team, at the Olympics for the slalom. His fast training times earned him a spot on the four-man team, displacing Walcher, the reigning world champion. All four Austrians in the race finished in the top ten and Müller was fourth.

Hopman Cup
The Hopman Cup is an annual international eight-team indoor hardcourt tennis tournament held in Perth, Western Australia in early January (sometimes commencing in late December) each year, which plays mixed-gender teams on a country-by-country basis. 

The championship is named in honour of Harry Hopman (1906–1985), an Australian tennis player and coach who guided the country to 15 Davis Cup titles between 1938 and 1969.  Since the Hopman Cup was founded in 1989, it has been attended each year by Harry Hopman's widow, his second wife Lucy, who travels to the tournament annually from her home in the United States. 

The tournament is a sanctioned event in the calendar of the International Tennis Federation (ITF), but individual player results are not included in the calculation of the tennis world rankings. The competition receives extensive television coverage in Australia and is an important lead-up tournament to the Australian Open each January as part of the Australian Open Series. The winning team receives a silver cup perpetual trophy and up to 2014 the winning team members were presented with distinctive individual trophies in the shape of a tennis ball encrusted with diamonds from the Argyle diamond mine in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.  In 2014 and 2015, the individual trophies were created in the shape of an intricate diamond encrusted tennis racket and ball, using just under an ounce of 18-carat white, yellow and rose gold and approximately half an ounce of pink argyle diamonds. These trophies are valued at $26,000.

Until 2012, the Hopman Cup was played at the Burswood Dome. Since 2013, the Hopman Cup has been played at the Perth Arena. 

Format

Unlike other major international team tennis tournaments such as the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup, which are for men or women only, the Hopman Cup is a mixed competition in which male and female players are on combined teams and represent their countries. Players are invited to attend and national coaches are not involved in selecting teams.

Eight nations are selected annually to compete in the Hopman Cup. (The ""last"" team may be decided by play-offs between several nations before competition begins. For the 2007 Hopman Cup however, this did not occur, due to the Asian Qualifying Tournament creating the eighth team. The official tournament website also has no qualifier listed in its schedule.)

Each team consists of one male player and one female player. Each match-up between two teams at the championships consists of:
* one women's singles match
* one men's singles match
* one mixed doubles match

The eight competing teams are separated into two groups of four (with two teams being seeded) and face-off against each of the other three teams in their group in a round-robin format. These seedings ensure that each group has approximately similar strength. The top team in each group then meet in a final to decide the champions.

If a player is injured then a player of a lower ranking of that nation may be the substitute.

Management

The 2014 Hopman Cup Tournament Director is Paul Kilderry after the resignation of Steve Ayles.   Previously, the former Australian tennis player Paul McNamee, who played a key role in the founding of the championships, was the tournament director.

History

Up to and including 2012, the venue was the Burswood Dome at the Burswood Entertainment Complex.

The 2005/06 Hopman Cup was the first elite-level tennis tournament in which the system was introduced allowing players to challenge point-ending line calls similar to that in clay court tournaments. The challenged calls are immediately reviewed on a large monitor using Hawk-Eye technology.

The 20th Hopman Cup, in 2008, was intended to be the last held at the Burswood Dome, however this was extended until 2012 when the new Perth Arena was due for completion.

2013 marks the 25th year of the running of the Hopman Cup.

Telecasts

The Hopman Cup was originally broadcast by the Seven Network until 1994, then by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1995–2010). From 2011, a five-year deal to broadcast the Hopman Cup was signed by the commercial television station Network Ten a deal which ended abruptly in November 2013. 7mate subsequently picked up the telecasting rights.

Passage:
George Hammond (diplomat)
George Hammond (1763–1853) was a British diplomat and one of the first British envoys to the United States from 1791 to 1795.

Early career

Hammond came from East Riding of Yorkshire, enjoyed a liberal education, and was a Master of Arts and Fellow of Merton College, Oxford. During the peace talks between the 13 colonies of the United States of America and the Kingdom of Great Britain that would culminate in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, he served as a Secretary to David Hartley; while in Paris, he also learned some French. Subsequently, Hammond was appointed chargé d'affaires at Vienna from 1788 to 1790, spent part of 1790 in Copenhagen, and in 1791 found himself Counsellor of Legation at Madrid.

Minister to the United States

Despite American grumbles over the lack of a British envoy since the peace treaty concluded the American revolution in 1783, the decision for the British was by no means a simple one. The Articles of Confederation lacked both a fixed seat of government and single leader to accredit an envoy, and few qualified diplomats desired the post and its yearly salary of £2500. David Hartley, himself approached for the position, recommended his former secretary Hammond to Charles Jenkinson, who in turn passed on the name to newly appointed Foreign Secretary William Grenville. Hammond was soon given the job, boarded a ship for Philadelphia in September 1791 along with Edward Thornton, secretary of legation, and arrived five weeks later on 20 October.

Hammond initially met with then Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, but waited to formally present himself to President George Washington before an American Minister to England was chosen; his reception on 11 November 1791 formally established relations between the two countries. Although Hammond described his situation as ""new, critical and rather embarrassing"", he also stated that ""If I accepted a quarter of the invitations to dinner and tea parties which I receive I should have little time for business"", and said of the leading families that ""I have reason to think most of them are Tories at heart.""

Hammond had four children, aged oldest to youngest: William Andrew, George, Margaret, Edmund. The titles (including spelling) and dates in the timeline come directly from these papers. They continue:
In the year 1806, when Mr. Hammond was entitled, from length of service, to a pension of 1,200 I., a pension of 600 l. was granted to him, together with pensions of 150 l. a year to each of his four children. His son, Edmund Hammond, would also join the Foreign Office.

Hammond left his post on 14 August 1795, leaving the consul general at Philadelphia, Phineas Bond, in charge until Robert Liston arrived in America.

Later career

Following his return from the United States, Hammond became an Undersecretary at the Foreign Office. In this position he advised and befriended Grenville and met George Canning; Canning founded the newspaper the Anti-Jacobin in 1797, and Hammond acted as joint-editor. Hammond would later be sent to one or two posts in continental Europe, and sometime in the 1810s he was appointed as a commissioner on the Arbitration of Revolutionary Indemnities, and as such spent many years living alternatively in London and Paris. Hammond died in 1853 at the age of ninety.

Timeline of career

*Secretary to Mr. Hartley's mission at Paris (1783 - 1784)
*Charge d'Affairs at Vienna (21 September 1788 - 10 October 1789)
*Secretary of legation at Copenhagen (20 February 1790 - 23 September 1790)
*Secretary of embassy at Madrid (24 September 1790 - 5 July 1791)
*Minister plenipotentiary to the United States (5 July 1791 - 30 October 1795)
*Under secretary of state for foreign affairs (10 October 1795 - 20 February 1806)
*Under secretary of state for foreign affairs (5 April 1807 - 11 November 1809)

It is the only tennis tournament to have been won by a woman. The last American to win the competition was in 2003, and the last American team to win it was in 2004, the United States. The tournament has been held in Perth for 25 years, with the most recent being in 2012. The Australian team won the tournament for the first time in 2008, with a win over New Zealand in the final. The first Australian team to triumph in the competition is the Australian men's team, which won the event in 2006. The American team has won six of the last seven Hopman Cups, the last time in 2010. The most recent Australian team was the Australian women’s team, who won the title in 2011. The Americans have won three of the past four Hopman cups, the only other time was in 2002, when they were beaten in the semi-finals. The US have won two of the previous three, in 2002 and 2003. The Australians have only won one of the four previous finals, in the 2006 final, which was held at the Australian Tennis Centre in Melbourne.

Ball game
Ball games (or ballgames), also ball sports, are any form of game or sport which feature a ball as part of play. These include games such as association football (soccer), baseball, basketball, and American football. Such games have diverse rules and histories and are of mostly unrelated origins. Ball games can be defined in several broad types:

*Bat-and-ball games, such as baseball and cricket.
*Racquet and ball games, such as tennis, squash and badminton.
*Hand and ball-striking games, such as various handball codes, rebound handball and four square.
*Goal sports, usually team sports such as basketball and all forms of football,  lacrosse, and hockey (the derived sport of ice hockey, which uses a puck rather than a ball, is classified with the goal, team ball sports for some purposes).
*Non-racquet net sports, such as volleyball and sepak takraw.
*Precision sports or target sports, such as bowling, lawn bowls, croquet, and golf, as well as cue sports, including snooker, pool, and other forms of billiards.

Purlin
In architecture, structural engineering or building, a purlin (or historically purline, purloyne, purling, perling) is any longitudinal, horizontal, structural member in a roof except a type of framing with what is called a crown plate. In traditional timber framing there are three basic types of purlin: purlin plate, principal purlin and common purlin.

Purlin plates in wooden construction

A purlin plate in wooden construction is also called an ""arcade plate"" in European English,  ""under purlin"", and ""principal purlin"". The term plate means a major, horizontal, supporting timber. Purlin plates are beams which support the mid-span of rafters and are supported by posts. By supporting the rafters they allow longer spans than the rafters alone could span thus allowing a wider building. Purlin plates are very commonly found in large, old barns in North America. A crown plate has similarities to a purlin plate but supports collar beams in the middle of a timber framed building.

Principal purlins in wood construction

Principal purlins in wood construction, also called ""major purlin"", ""side purlin"". Principal purlins are supported by principal rafters and support common rafters in what is known as a ""double roof"" (a roof framed with a layer of principal rafters and a layer of common rafters). Principal purlins are further classified by how they connect to the principal rafters:  ""Through purlins"" pass over the top; ""butt purlins"" tenon into the sides of the principal rafters; ""clasped purlins,"" of which only one historic U.S. example is known,) are captured by a collar beam. Through purlins are further categorized as trenched, back, or clasped; butt purlins are classified as threaded, tenoned, and/or staggered. 

Common purlins in wood construction

Common purlins in wood construction, also called a ""major-rafter minor-purlin system"".  Common purlins are typically ""trenched through"" the top sides (backs) of principal rafters and carry vertical roof sheathing (The key to identifying this type of roof system). Common purlin roofs in North America are found in areas settled by Englishmen and may have been a new invention in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. No examples of framed buildings with common purlin roofs have been reported in England, however some stone barns in England have vertically boarded, common purlin roofs. Historically, these roofs are found in New England, the highest concentration in Maine, and isolated parts of New York and along the St. Lawrence River in Canada. One of the oldest extant (surviving) examples is in the Coffin House in Newbury, Massachusetts from 1678. The purpose of a common purlin roof may be they allow a board roof, that is a roof of nothing but vertically laid boards with seams covered with battens or another layer of boards. 

Steel construction

In steel construction, the term purlin typically refers to roof framing members that span parallel to the building eave, and support the roof decking or sheeting.  The purlins are in turn supported by rafters or walls. Purlins are most commonly used in Metal Building Systems, where Z-shapes are utilized in a manner that allows flexural continuity between spans.

It is the practice in the steel industry that structural shapes are assigned representative designations for convenient shorthand description on drawings and documentation: Channel sections, with or without flange stiffeners, are usually referenced as C shapes; Channel sections without flange stiffeners are also referenced as U shapes; Point symmetric sections that are shaped similar to the letter Z are referenced as Z shapes. Section designations can be regional and even specific to a manufacturer. In steel building construction, secondary members such as purlins (roof) and girts (wall) are frequently cold-formed steel C, Z or U sections, (or mill rolled) C sections.

Cold formed members can be efficient on a weight basis relative to mill rolled sections for secondary member applications. Additionally, Z sections can be nested for transportation bundling and, on the building, lapped at the supports to develop a structurally efficient continuous beam across multiple supports.

Etymology

Information on the origin of the term ""purlin"" is scant. The Oxford Dictionary suggests a French origin, with the earliest quote using a variation of purlin in 1447.

The Cruel Sea (novel)
The Cruel Sea is a 1951 novel by Nicholas Monsarrat. It follows the lives of a group of Royal Navy sailors fighting the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II.
It contains seven chapters, each describing a year during the war.

The novel, based on the author's experience of serving in corvettes in the North Atlantic in World War II, gives a matter-of-fact but moving portrayal of ordinary men learning to fight and survive in a violent, exhausting battle against the elements and a ruthless enemy.

Plot summary

The action commences in 1939. Lieutenant-Commander George Ericson, a Merchant Navy and Royal Naval Reserve officer, is recalled to the Royal Navy and given command of the fictitious Flower-class corvette HMS Compass Rose, newly built to escort convoys. His officers are mostly new to the Navy, especially the two new sub-lieutenants, Lockhart and Ferraby. Only Ericson and the petty officers are in any way experienced.

Despite these initial disadvantages, the ship and crew work up a routine and gain experience. Bennett, the first lieutenant, a mean and shirking disciplinarian with a penchant for bullying and canned sausages (snorkers), leaves the ship ostensibly for health reasons, and the junior officers are able to mature, with Lockhart gaining promotion to first lieutenant.

The crew cross the Atlantic many times on escort duty in all kinds of weather, often encountering fierce storms in one of the smallest ships to provide escort services to the Allied convoys. The men endure the ship's constant rolling and pitching in the huge waves, freezing cold, the strain of maintaining station on the convoy on pitch-black nights and the fear that at any second a torpedo from a German U-boat could blow them to oblivion. Somehow the tradition of the Royal Navy and the knowledge of the importance of their work carries them through.

They continue the monotonous and dangerous but vital duty of convoy escort and after one particularly difficult convoy they use all their hard won knowledge to sink a German submarine. 
They are nearly sunk several times until in 1943 they are finally torpedoed and forced to abandon ship. Most of the crew die in the freezing waters, but Ericson, Lockhart, Ferraby, and a few others are rescued the next day, but Ferraby suffers a break down forcing him to go to hospital.

Ericson, now promoted to commander, and Lockhart, now a lieutenant-commander, take command of a new ship, the fictitious River class frigate HMS Saltash. (In the film adaptation, the ship is called Saltash Castle and is portrayed by the Castle class corvette HMS Portchester Castle, as no River class vessels were available.)

The Royal Navy is now finally gaining the upper hand over the U-boats and Saltash adds to the growing number of kills due to Ericson's determination and patience.

In chapter seven the ship receives a message ordering it to ""remain on patrol in vicinity of Rockall"" as the end of the Second World War approaches in 1945, a well-known quote.

When the war ends, the ship returns to port as a guard to several German submarines that have surrendered.

A secondary plotline concerns Lockhart's poignant romance with a beautiful Women's Royal Naval Service officer.

Origins

Nicholas Monsarrat's own career was the model for that of his character Lockhart, a Fleet Street reporter in the 1930s, commissioned as a naval reservist.  Monsarrat spent the war in anti-submarine escort ships, rising to the rank of Lieutenant-Commander.  His first book, Three Corvettes was published in 1945.  After the war he was a publicity officer at British missions overseas (notably Ottawa) before becoming a full-time writer.

Film and radio adaptations

The novel was  made into the film The Cruel Sea in 1953, directed by Charles Frend and starring Jack Hawkins as Commander Ericson and Donald Sinden as Lockhart.

Harbour as Lockhart, and with Terry Molloy as the Coxswain of Saltash. Recording took place with the assistance of the captain and ship's company of HMS Brighton and the captain of HMS Scylla. The narrator was Martin Muncaster. In March 2012, another two hour version, starred Gwilym Lee as Lockhart and Jonathan Coy as Ericson. Dramatised by John Fletcher and directed by Marc Beeby, this adaptation went on to win 'Best Use of Sound in an Audio Drama' in the BBC Audio Drama Awards 2013.

Passage:
Three Times a Lady
""Three Times a Lady"" is a song by American soul group the Commodores, from their 1978 album Natural High. It was produced by James Anthony Carmichael and the Commodores. It was also the only Motown song to reach the Top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 that year and the Commodores's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one hit, topping the chart for two weeks on August 12, 1978 and also went to number one the soul chart for two weeks.   The song spent three weeks at #1 on the adult contemporary chart. 

The song also reached #1 on the Canadian RPM Singles Chart for four weeks, and was one of only a few Motown singles to reach the top spot in the UK Singles Chart, staying there for five weeks.  The song was also successful in Ireland, staying at #1 in the charts for three consecutive weeks. It was #1 in Australia for five weeks, and reached #2 in New Zealand.

The original Commodores' version of the song was included as the final track on Lionel Richie's greatest hits compilation album Back To Front, released in 1992.

In an appearance on The Early Show on June 12, 2009, Lionel Richie said he was inspired to write the song because of a comment his father made about his mother. His father said to his mother ""I love you. I want you. I need you. Forever"" hence the three times a lady. 

Covers

Passage:
Concertgebouw
The Royal Concertgebouw (,) is a concert hall in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The Dutch term ""concertgebouw"" literally translates into English as ""concert building"". On 11 April 2013, on occasion of the building's 125th anniversary, Queen Beatrix bestowed the Royal Title ""Koninklijk"" upon the building, as she did previously (in 1988) to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.  Because of its highly regarded acoustics, the Concertgebouw is considered one of the finest concert halls in the world, along with places such as Boston's Symphony Hall   and the Musikverein in Vienna.

History

The architect of the building was Adolf Leonard van Gendt, who was inspired by the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, built two years earlier (and destroyed in 1943).

Construction began in 1883 in a pasture that was then outside the city, in Nieuwer-Amstel, a municipality that in 1964 became Amstelveen.  A total of 2,186 piles of length twelve to thirteen metres (40 to 43 ft) were sunk into the soil.

The hall opened on 11 April 1888 with an inaugural concert, in which an orchestra of 120 musicians and a chorus of 500 singers participated, performing works of Wagner, Handel, Bach, and Beethoven. The resident orchestra of the Concertgebouw is the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (Koninklijk Concertgebouworkest), which gave its first concert in the hall on 3 November 1888, as the Concertgebouw Orchestra (Concertgebouworkest). For many decades the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra and the Radio Filharmonisch Orkest have also been regular performers in the Concertgebouw.

The Main Hall (Grote Zaal) seats 1,974, and is 44 metres (144 ft) long, 28 metres (92 ft) wide, and 17 metres (56 ft) high.  Its reverberation time is 2.8 seconds without audience, 2.2 seconds with, making it ideal for the late Romantic repertoire such as Mahler. Though this characteristic makes it largely unsuited for amplified music, groups such as Led Zeppelin, The Who and Pink Floyd performed there in the 1960s. It hosts not only orchestral and operatic performances, but also jazz and world music.

A smaller, oval-shaped venue, the Recital Hall (Kleine Zaal), is located behind the Main Hall. The Recital Hall is 20 metres (66 ft) long and 15 metres (50 ft) wide. Its more intimate space is well-suited for chamber music and Lieder. The Recital Hall has 437 seats.

When the Concertgebouw was built, acoustics were something of a black art. As in shipbuilding, designers drew upon what had worked in the past without entirely understanding the underlying science. When the building was completed, the acoustics were not perfect, and a lot of effort went into fine-tuning the aural ambience. During later restorations, particular care has been taken not to alter the materials used for interior decoration with this in mind. In the 1980s, the hall embarked on extensive fund-raising for renovations after the hall was found to be slowly sinking into the ground. Pi de Bruijn was the architect for the contemporary annex to the original hall. 

Today, some nine hundred concerts and other events per year take place in the Concertgebouw, for a public of over 700,000, making it one of the most-visited concert halls in the world. 

, the managing director of the Concertgebouw is Simon Reinink and the artistic director is Anneke Hogenstijn. 

Organ 

The organ was built in 1890 by the organ builder Michael Maarschalkerweerd from Utrecht, and was renovated in the years 1990-1993 by the organ builder Flentrop. It has 60 registers on three divisions and pedal. 

* Couplers: II/I (also as Suboktavkoppel), III/I, III/II, I/P, II/P, III/P

Names of composers in the Main Hall

In the Main Hall, the surnames of the following 46 composers are displayed on the balcony ledges and on the walls: 

In popular culture

The Concertgebouw is mentioned, along with Madison Square Garden, the Hollywood Bowl, and the Rainbow Theatre, in the song ""Rock Show"" from the 1975 Wings album Venus and Mars.

Kris Debruyne, a Belgian singer, mentions the Concertgebouw in his song ""Amsterdam"".

Josephine Wayne
Josephine S. Wayne (born Josephine Alicia Saenz; May 13, 1908 – June 24, 2003) was the first wife of American film actor John Wayne. She had four children including film producer Michael Wayne and actor Patrick Wayne.

Biography

Josephine Alicia ""Josie"" Saenz was born May 13, 1908 to the Consul General of Panama in the United States,  José Saenz, a wealthy businessman who lived in Los Angeles, California.  Her parents were born in Madrid, Spain.
Aged 15 or 16 when she met John Wayne, an actor in college still named Marion Morrison, while at a beach party in Balboa, California. Their relationship met with considerable resistance from her Catholic family because he was a Presbyterian. 
 

Marriage

After courting for seven years, Wayne's financial status improved considerably due to his success at the box office, and he was able to convince her family to allow the marriage. The couple married on June 24, 1933, in a garden ceremony at actress Loretta Young's home. 

The couple had four children: Michael Wayne (film producer, November 23, 1934 – April 2, 2003), Mary Antonia ""Toni"" Morrison-LaCava (February 25, 1936 –  December 6, 2000), Patrick Wayne (born July 15, 1939) and Melinda Morrison-Muñoz (born December 3, 1940).

After a few years, the marriage was in trouble. Wayne worked long hours at his career and was always surrounded by associates from the film world. The couple also had differences of opinion about how their children should be raised.  In 1943 they separated and eventually divorced in 1945.  She also found great happiness in 1996 when she married Cyril Nigg (died March, 1999 ), a well known Los Angeles businessman, who shared her love of service to the community.

Death

Josephine Saenz died in 2003, at age 95, from cancer, having been predeceased by two of her children, Michael and Toni.

Passage:
Tine (structural)
Tines or prongs or teeth are parallel or branching spikes forming parts of a tool or natural object.   They are used to spear, hook, move or otherwise act on other objects.  They may be made of metal, wood, bone or other hard, strong material.

The number of tines (also written tynes) on tools varies widely – a pitchfork may have just two, a garden fork may have four, and a rake or harrow many.  Tines may be blunt, such as those on a fork used as an eating utensil; or sharp, as on a pitchfork; or even barbed, as on a trident. The terms ""tine"" and ""prong"" are mostly interchangeable. A tooth of a comb is a tine.

Tines and prongs occur in nature—for example, forming the branched bony antlers of deer or the forked horns of pronghorn antelopes. The term ""tine"" is also used for mountains, such as the fictional Silvertine in The Lord of the Rings.

In chaos theory (physics, non-linear dynamics), the branches of a bifurcation diagram are called tines and subtines.
Question:
What is a prong of a fork called

Passage:
List of association football teams to have won four or more trophies in one season
In a football season, clubs typically compete in a number of different competitions: usually a domestic league and at least one cup competition, as well as sometimes competing in continental football, that is, the tournaments organised by one of FIFA's six confederations. Winning multiple competitions is seen as a particularly momentous achievement. 

Doubles and trebles are usually long-remembered achievements, but do occur with some level of frequency.  By contrast, winning four or more trophies in one season is exceptionally rare. In recent years, the terms quadruple, quintuple and sextuple have come to be occasionally used to refer to winning four, five or six top-tier trophies in a single season.     

The list below considers only teams whose victories include trophies in the top tier of their league system.

Four titles in one season

Some clubs have won four competitions in a single season. This has sometimes been called a 'quadruple'.

Other teams have won four competitions in a calendar year, though not all in the same season.

Five titles in one season

Other teams have won five competitions in a calendar year, though not all in the same season. Liverpool achieved this in 2001, winning all competitions entered with the exception of the domestic league title;  Internazionale achieved this feat in 2010 (no UEFA Super Cup), Spanish club F.C. Barcelona achieved this in 2011 (all but 2010–11 Copa del Rey) and 2015 (all but 2015 Supercopa de España);  Germany's FC Bayern Munich won five trophies in 2013 (everything but the DFL-Supercup). 

Six titles in a season

Barcelona won six titles in 2009 (Copa del Rey, La Liga, UEFA Champions League, Supercopa de España, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup)  has been described as a 'sextuple'; however, this achievement took place over the course of two different Spanish seasons, winning a treble in the 2008–09 season.   It is counted together by many as the three added trophies were extra matches of the treble won, played in the same calendar year.

Seven titles in a season
Question:
Which football club was the first to win the sextuple of all possible major competitions?
Answer:
The weather in Barcelona

You (S Club 7 song)
""You"" was the 9th single released by UK pop group S Club 7 on 11 February 2002. The track is a very uptempo-retro number reminiscent of the group's third single ""You're My Number One"". The video was set in the 1950s and is described in the Best CD booklet as the ""candyfloss-bright, tongue-in-cheek 50s pastiche"". This track was the last single to feature departed band member Paul Cattermole and sparked the last leg of the S Club 7 journey. The song reached no. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. It also charted on the 2002 Year End Singles chart at number 70.

Music video

The first part of the video stars Rachel Stevens as a wife who cooks food for her husband portrayed by Paul Cattermole. Paul comes home and Rachel tries to feed him. But a mistress played by Jo O'Meara appears out of nowhere, distracts Paul and they start dancing. Then they enter another room through a curtain, revealing the other band members. The part ends with Hannah Spearritt dancing. The second part shows Rachel mowing the lawn. Jon Lee joins her, but soon goes to Jo, who is having a barbecue. The smoke from the grill show the other 6 members dancing under umbrellas. Rachel looks while using a hose. It turns off, then it sprays Rachel in the face. The third part takes place in the garage. Bradley McIntosh is repairing the car. Rachel looks at him, Bradley does likewise. Then Jo appears in the car dancing with Bradley. The others come in. Rachel is sad until the others sing to her. They all sing together and they drive off.

The music video for 'You' was filmed after ""Don't Stop Movin'"" and was intended as the follow up single before the group were asked to record the Children In Need single ('Have You Ever') for that year.

Passage:
Harry Hole
Harry Hole is the main character in a series of crime novels written by Norwegian author Jo Nesbø. Hole is a brilliant and driven detective with unorthodox methods, a classic loose cannon in the police force.

Character

Harry Hole, a police officer with the Oslo Crime Squad, lost his mother, a descendant of the Sami people, to cancer while he was in his twenties, and he has never had a close relationship to his father, Olav Hole, a former teacher. He was born in 1965, and has a younger sister with Down syndrome. He is unmarried, but has had close relationships with a number of women throughout the series of ten novels. Otherwise, he has few close friends – and the ability to make enemies from amongst his colleagues who, nevertheless, grudgingly respect him.

Hole is a heavy smoker and an alcoholic although, at times, his alcoholism is under control. The effects of his problem sometimes bring him into repeated conflict with his superiors and some colleagues, but Bjarne Møller, head of Hole's department and one of his closest friends, manages to prevent him from being sacked as a result, primarily because he recognises that Harry Hole is a brilliant detective who is recognised amongst his colleagues because of his role in the solving the case of a serial killer in Australia. Hole is one of few in the force who has undergone special training in police interrogation techniques and firearms by the FBI.

Hole has few friends within the Oslo Police Department, exceptions being some staff at the forensics division of the Norwegian police, including Beate Lønn, whom he often uses to secure crucial information in critical situations where specialist knowledge is required, and Bjørn Holm, another skilled forensics officer. Harry is also friendly with Gunnar Hagen, his former senior officer prior to the case chronicled in Phantom.

In many ways, the author's home city of Oslo has the starring role in the Harry Hole novels. Much of the background detail of the stories involves real locations, and the city is shown ""warts and all"", ranging from Hole's favourite eating and drinking places that he frequents, to the traffic of the so-called ""Traffic Machine"" road system, the real-life headquarters of the Police Department, the swimming pool at Frogner Park, to the haunts of neo-Nazis, drug addicts and prostitutes, all of this described vividly (in the various novels) at different times of the year – in the snow and freezing weather of winter to the high temperatures of a particularly warm summer. Harry Hole's friends and acquaintances include city residents from every social background, including immigrants from other parts of the world to old school friends such as Øystein Eikeland, the taxi driver – possibly the person with whom he is closest.

Harry Hole's home address is in Sofies Gate in Bislett, Oslo. In Phantom he no longer lives here, as he has been in Hong Kong for three years. Near his place of residence is his favourite ""watering hole"", Restaurant Schrøder (Schrøder's, for short) in St. Hanshaugen, which figures in most of the novels. He has had a serious relationship with Rakel Fauke, whose son, Oleg, looks up to Harry as a father figure. After the case chronicled in The Snowman, their relationship is put under severe pressure.

""Hole"", Harry's family name, is the name of a historic Norwegian town (Hole, Norway), with a heritage that goes back to Norway's origins in the Viking Age. The name is derived from Old Norse Hólar, the plural form of hóll, meaning ""round (and isolated) hill"". The word is pronounced as two syllables, with stress on the first (hoh-leh), as is implied in The Bat, where the Australian police call him ""Harry Holy"".

Appearances in the Harry Hole series

* In The Bat (1997), Hole is sent to Sydney, Australia to aid the Australian police in their investigation of the murder of a Norwegian citizen.
* In Cockroaches (1998), Hole is sent to Thailand to investigate the murder of the Norwegian ambassador.
* In The Redbreast (2000), Hole tracks an assassin planning an attack on a prominent member of the establishment.
* In Nemesis (2002), Hole investigates a fatal bank robbery and becomes implicated in the apparent murder of an ex-girlfriend.
* In The Devil's Star (2003), Hole investigates a series of serial killings and suspects a fellow policeman of criminal activity. 
* In The Redeemer (2005), Hole is on the trail of a Croatian hitman who kills a Salvation Army officer during a Christmas street concert.
* In The Snowman (2007), Hole struggles to identify Norway's first serial killer.
* In The Leopard (2009), Hole returns from self-imposed exile in Hong Kong and unofficially investigates a serial killer.
* In Phantom (2011), Hole again returns from Hong Kong to look into a murder apparently committed by his would-be son, Oleg. His investigation draws him into Oslo's drug scene.
* In Police (2013), Hole is needed once again to discover the identity of a serial killer who is stalking the streets of Oslo, killing police officers who previously investigated old cases.

Amps and Watts Usage | Electrical Safety First
Amps and Watts Usage | Electrical Safety First
 
Further information:
The fuse in a plug is a safety device designed to protect the lead rather than the appliance. It is a deliberate weak link in a circuit which will 'blow' if an electrical appliance or extension lead draws too much current due to either an overload or a fault. The blown fuse cuts off the electricity to stop the lead and appliance from overheating and causing a fire.
Appliances meeting the relevant product safety standards will always be fitted with a plug having a correctly-rated fuse. If you have to replace a fuse, it's essential, having checked and corrected the reason for the fuse blowing, to replace it only with another of the same rating.
As a rule of thumb, fuses are rated according to the power rating of the appliance. Plugs for appliances rated up to about 700 watts should have a 3 amp fuse (coloured red).  Plugs for appliances rated between about 700 watts and 3000 watts (the maximum rating of a wall socket) should be fitted with a 13 amp fuse (coloured brown). (Some older appliances were fitted with 5 amp fuses (coloured black), which are still available to buy.)

Theakston Brewery
T&R Theakston is an English brewery located in the market town of Masham, North Yorkshire. The company is the sixteenth largest brewer in the UK by market share, and the second largest brewer under family ownership after Shepherd Neame.

History

T&R Theakston Ltd. was founded in 1827 by Robert Theakston and John Wood at The Black Bull pub and brewhouse in Masham. By 1832 Theakston had sole ownership of the brewery and in 1875 he passed control over to his son Thomas who expanded the range of buildings by building the new brewery on the Paradise Fields.

In 1919 the company acquired and closed down the Lightfoot Brewery, also in Masham.

Theakston's expanded into Cumbria in 1974 buying the Carlisle State Management Brewery.  The brewery had been owned and operated by the government since 1916.  However the site was a financial drain  on Theakston's and led to the company being taken over in 1984 by Blackburn based brewer, Matthew Brown plc.   Matthew Brown was itself taken over by Scottish & Newcastle in 1987.

Paul Theakston (Managing Director since 1968) left Theakston's in 1988, and in 1992 established the Black Sheep Brewery in the old Lightfoot Brewery premises - located adjacent to the White Bear Hotel, one of Theakston's pubs.

The Carlisle brewery was closed in 1987, and brewing of some Theakston beers was transferred to Scottish & Newcastle's Tyne Brewery.

In 2004 the business returned to family ownership after being purchased back from Scottish & Newcastle by four Theakston brothers.  Major development works at the Masham Brewery enabled the company to announce that brewing of Theakston Bitter would return to Masham in 2009. 

Beers

The company produces cask ale and pasteurised bottled ales. Theakston cask ales are widely available in pubs in the north of England, though are less common in other parts of the country. The bottled beers are also widely distributed to British supermarkets and exported to Germany and the United States.

The company produces five regular cask ales and six seasonal. Only two of the beers are filtered and pasteurised to be made available in bottles, Theakston XB and Old Peculier.

Best Bitter (3.8% ABV) is regularly paired with XB in pubs, Theakston Best Bitter is the company's most easily found product, served in many pubs, mainly in the north of England.

XB (4.5% ABV) is a premium strength Bitter with a more complex flavour. It was launched in 1982.[http://www.barnsleycamra.org.uk/thebar/1992/april-1992.pdf ""Barnley's Bitter - Brewery News""], Barnsleycamra.org.uk, April–May 1992. Retrieved 28 November 2011

Black Bull Bitter (3.9% ABV) was brewed to commemorate the Theakson's first pub where the first Theakston's beers were brewed and sold.

Traditional Mild (3.5% ABV) is the weakest beer produced by Theakston, a dark and dry drink created as an alternative for dark ales. It was launched in 1992.

Lightfoot Bitter (4.1%abv) originally brewed as a seasonal bitter but with its high popularity has become one of many regular Theakstons brew. Golden in colour and bitter in taste, a favourite in many s&n public houses.

Old Peculier (5.6% ABV) is Theakston's most famous beer. Old Peculier has been made under this name since  the 1890s. In 2000, it won the silver medal in the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA)'s ""Champion Winter Beer of Britain"" 2000 competition. The label on the bottle describes it as a ""full bodied, rich, smooth tasting ale with a mysterious and distinctive flavour"". It is named after the peculier of Masham, a peculier being a parish outside the jurisdiction of a diocese. In 1985 The Economist dubbed it the ""doyen of real ales."" 

The six seasonal ales are Cooper's Butt (4.3% ABV), Hogshead Bitter (4.1% ABV), Grouse Beater (4.2% ABV), Masham Ale (6.5% ABV) and Paradise Ale (4.2% ABV).

Visitor Centre

The brewery also runs a small visitor centre at its home in Masham where guided tours are given about the actual working brewery. At the end of the tour, visitors are given tokens that can be exchanged for drinks at the bar of the Black Bull in Paradise, named after the original pub (Black Bull) and the location of the new brewery (Paradise Fields). There is also a small shop, selling crates of bottled XB and Old Peculier, beer glasses, T-shirts and an assortment of other souvenirs.

In popular culture

In the All Creatures Great and Small episode ""Golden Lads & Girls"", James Herriot and Tristan Farnon are seen drinking a Theakston Nutty Brown Ale.

In The Shadow of Israphel there is a character named Old Peculier.

In Martha Grimes' Richard Jury novels, the character of Melrose Plant prefers Old Peculier.

Benefits Supervisor Sleeping
Benefits Supervisor Sleeping is a 1995 oil on canvas painting by Lucian Freud depicting an obese, naked woman lying on a couch. It is a portrait of Sue Tilley, then weighing about 127 kg,  a Job Centre supervisor. Tilley is the author of a biography of the Australian performer Leigh Bowery titled Leigh Bowery, The Life and Times of an Icon. Tilley was introduced to Freud by Bowery, who was already modelling for him. Freud painted a number of large portraits of her around the period 1994–96, and came to call her ""Big Sue"". He said of her body ""It's flesh without muscle and it has developed a different kind of texture through bearing such a weight-bearing thing"".  

The painting held the world record for the highest price paid for a painting by a living artist when it was sold by Guy Naggar  for US$33.6 million (£17.2 million)  at Christie's in New York in May 2008 to Roman Abramovich.  This record was broken by the Freud painting Benefits Supervisor Resting, which sold for £35.8million ($56.2million) in 2015.

A new edition was printed in 1915 with the name Keep the Home-Fires Burning. The song became very popular in the United Kingdom during the war, along with It's a Long Way to Tipperary.

James F. Harrison recorded Keep the Home-Fires Burning in 1915, as did Stanley Kirkby in 1916. Another popular recording was sung by tenor John McCormack in 1917, who was also the first to record It's a Long Way to Tipperary in 1914. (See External links below to hear these recordings of Keep the Home-Fires Burning.) Other versions include one by Frederick J. Wheeler and one by the duet Reed Miller & Frederick Wheeler. 

There is a misconception that Ivor Novello's mother wrote the lyrics for the song (propagated—for example—by patter in recorded performances of British musical comedy duo Hinge and Bracket) but Lena Ford (an American) was a friend and collaborator of Novello, not a blood relation.

Lyrics

They were summoned from the hillside,
They were called in from the glen,
And the country found them ready
At the rallying call for men
Let no tears add to their hardships
As the soldiers pass along,
And although your heart is breaking,
Make it sing this cheery song:

Keep the Home Fires Burning,
While your hearts are yearning.
Though your lads are far away
They dream of home.
There's a silver lining
Through the dark clouds shining,
Turn the dark cloud inside out
Till the boys come home.

Overseas there came a pleading,
""Help a nation in distress.""
And we gave our glorious laddies -
Honour bade us do no less,
For no gallant son of Freedom
To a tyrant's yoke should bend,
And a noble heart must answer
To the sacred call of ""Friend.""

Keep the Home Fires Burning,
While your hearts are yearning.
Though your lads are far away
They dream of home.
There's a silver lining
Through the dark clouds shining,
Turn the dark cloud inside out
'Til the boys come home.

Passage:
Lead chamber process
The lead chamber process was an industrial method used to produce sulfuric acid in large quantities. It has been largely supplanted by the contact process.

In 1746 in Birmingham, England, John Roebuck began producing sulfuric acid in lead-lined chambers, which were stronger, were less expensive, and could be made much larger than the glass containers which had been used previously. This allowed the effective industrialization of sulfuric acid production and, with several refinements, this process remained the standard method of production for almost two centuries. So robust was the process that as late as 1946, the chamber process still accounted for 25% of sulfuric acid manufactured. 

Process 

Sulfur dioxide is introduced with steam and nitrogen oxide into large chambers lined with sheet lead where the gases are sprayed down with water and chamber acid. The sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide dissolve and over a period of approximately 30 minutes the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfuric acid. The presence of nitrogen dioxide is necessary for the reaction to proceed at a reasonable rate. The process is highly exothermic, and a major consideration of the design of the chambers was to provide a way to dissipate the heat formed in the reactions.

Early plants used very large lead-lined wooden rectangular chambers (Faulding box chambers) that were cooled by ambient air. The internal lead sheathing served to contain the corrosive sulfuric acid and to render the wooden chambers waterproof. Around the turn of the nineteenth century, such plants required about half a cubic meter of volume to process the sulfur dioxide equivalent of a kilogram of burned sulfur.  In the mid-19th century, French chemist Gay-Lussac redesigned the chambers as stoneware packed masonry cylinders. In the 20th century, plants using Mills-Packard chambers supplanted the earlier designs. These chambers were tall tapered cylinders that were externally cooled by water flowing down the outside surface of the chamber.

Sulfur dioxide for the process was provided by burning elemental sulfur or by the roasting of sulfur-containing metal ores in a stream of air in a furnace. During the early period of manufacture, nitrogen oxides were produced by the decomposition of niter at high temperature in the presence of acid, but this process was gradually supplanted by the air oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide in the presence of a catalyst.  The recovery and reuse of oxides of nitrogen was an important economic consideration in the operation of a chamber process plant.

In the reaction chambers, nitric oxide reacts with oxygen to produce nitrogen dioxide.  Liquid from the bottom of the chambers is diluted and pumped to the top of the chamber and sprayed downwards in a fine mist. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are absorbed in the liquid and react to form sulfuric acid and nitric oxide. The liberated nitric oxide is sparingly soluble in water and returns to the gas in the chamber where it reacts with oxygen in the air to reform nitrogen dioxide. Some percentage of the nitrogen oxides are sequestered in the reaction liquor as nitrosylsulfuric acid and as nitric acid, so fresh nitric oxide must be added as the process proceeds. Later versions of chamber plants included a high-temperature Glover tower to recover the nitrogen oxides from the chamber liquor, while concentrating the chamber acid to as much as 78% H2SO4. Exhaust gases from the chambers are scrubbed by passing into a tower through which some of the Glover acid flows over broken tile. Nitrogen oxides are absorbed to form nitrosylsulfuric acid, which is then returned to the Glover tower to reclaim the oxides of nitrogen.

Sulfuric acid produced in the reaction chambers is limited to about 35% concentration.  At higher concentrations, nitrosylsulfuric acid precipitates on the lead walls as chamber crystals and is no longer able to catalyze the oxidation reactions. 

Chemistry 

Sulfur dioxide is generated by burning elemental sulfur or by roasting pyritic ore in a current of air:

S8 + 8 O2 → 8 SO2 
4 FeS2 + 11 O2 → 2 Fe2O3 + 8 SO2

Nitrogen oxides are produced by decomposition of niter in the presence of sulfuric acid or hydrolysis of nitrosylsulfuric acid:

2 NaNO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O + NO + NO2 + O2
2 NOHSO4 + H2O →  2 H2SO4 + NO + NO2

In the reaction chambers, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide dissolve in the reaction liquor.  Nitrogen dioxide is hydrated to produce nitrous acid which then oxidizes the sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid and nitric oxide.  The reactions are not well characterized but it is known that nitrosylsulfuric acid is an intermediate in at least one pathway. The major overall reactions are:

2 NO2 + H2O → HNO2 + HNO3
SO2 (aq) + HNO3 → NOHSO4
NOHSO4 + HNO2 →  H2SO4 + NO2 + NO
SO2 (aq) + 2 HNO2 → H2SO4 + 2 NO

Nitric oxide escapes from the reaction liquor and is subsequently reoxidized by molecular oxygen to nitrogen dioxide.  This is the overall rate determining step in the process: 

2 NO + O2 → 2 NO2

Nitrogen oxides are absorbed and regenerated in the process, and thus serve as a catalyst for the overall reaction:

2 SO2 + 2 H2O + O2 → 2 H2SO4

Passage:
Chris Andrews (singer)
Christopher Frederick ""Chris"" Andrews (born 15 October 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, whose musical career started in the late 1950s.   

Career

Andrews was born in Romford, Essex, England, and by his mid teens had formed his own group, Chris Ravel and the Ravers,  and was playing at Soho venues which included the 2i's Coffee Bar and Flamingo Nightclub. On 14 March 1959, he made his British television debut, performing on the Oh, Boy! show. He would later return in April to perform a cover of Cliff Richard's, ""Move It"".

For Adam Faith, Andrews wrote ""The First Time"" (No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart, 1963)  and ""We Are in Love"" (No. 11, 1964), and then a string of hits for Sandie Shaw. They included ""Girl Don't Come"" (No. 3, 1964/65), ""I'll Stop at Nothing"" (No. 4, 1965), ""Message Understood"" (No. 6, 1965) and ""Long Live Love"" (No. 1, 1965). The latter remained a chart topper in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks.  ""Girl Don't Come"" was covered by Cher on her debut album, All I Really Want to Do. 

Also in 1965, Andrews as a solo artist, got to No. 3 in the same listings with ""Yesterday Man"",  which peaked in Germany at No. 1 for four weeks;  followed up with a No. 13 hit in the UK ""To Whom It Concerns"".  The instrumental section of this song was used as the theme for RTÉ's long-running TV programme, The Late Late Show, until 1999, and a re-arranged version returned as the show's theme music in September 2009. As well as obtaining a high placing in the UK chart with ""Yesterday Man"", it also climbed to No. 1 in Ireland and Germany. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.  Later releases were not as successful, but his own hits are seen as early examples of reggae influenced white pop music. Although his chart appearances dwindled in Britain by 1966, his chart topping success continued in mainland Europe for a number of years, particularly in Germany, and Andrews often recorded in foreign languages.

In South Africa, his later single releases proved particularly popular,  with ""Pretty Belinda"" (1969), ""Carol OK"" and ""Brown Eyes"" (both 1970) all topping the charts there. ""Yo Yo"" reached No. 7 at the end of 1970.

Andrews remains active in his career as a singer-songwriter, working primarily in continental Europe and in the United Kingdom. He lives with his second wife Alexandra, who is also his manager, in Germany and Spain.

Passage:
Janet Horne
Janet Horne (died 1727) was an alleged witch from Scotland, and the last person to be executed for witchcraft in the British Isles. 

Janet Horne and her daughter were arrested in Dornoch in Sutherland and imprisoned on the accusations of her neighbours. Horne was showing signs of senility, and her daughter had a deformity of her hands and feet. The neighbours accused Horne of having used her daughter as a pony to ride to the Devil, where she had her shod by him. The trial was conducted very quickly; the sheriff had judged both guilty and sentenced them to be burned at the stake. The daughter managed to escape, but Janet was stripped, smeared with tar, paraded through the town on a barrel and burned alive. Nine years after her death the witchcraft acts were repealed in Scotland.

Janet (or Jenny) Horne was also a generic name for witches in the north of Scotland at the time and this makes it difficult to determine what the real name of this woman may have been. Contemporary writers may have called her 'Janet Horne' simply because her real name was unknown or because the name was reported as 'Janet Horne' and they were unaware that this was a generic name. Some sources give the date of the Dornoch execution as June 1722. 

Legacy

She is the subject of the play The Last Witch by Rona Munro, which premiered at the 2009 Edinburgh International Festival. 

Also, the events of the story are the subject of the song ""Am I Evil?"" by heavy metal band Diamond Head.

French Connection (clothing)
French Connection (also branded as FCUK) is a UK-based global retailer and wholesaler of fashion clothing, accessories and homeware. Founded in the early 1970s by Stephen Marks, who remains chief executive, it is based in London and its parent French Connection Group PLC is listed on the London Stock Exchange.

French Connection distributes its clothing and accessories through its own stores in the UK, US and Canada and through franchise and wholesale arrangements globally.  The company became notorious for the use of the ""fcuk"" initialism in its advertising campaigns in the early 2000s.

Other brands currently within the group include Great Plains, Toast and YMC. Former brands include Nicole Farhi.

Brand history

Stephen Marks, who started out in business in 1969 as the Stephen Marks brand, established French Connection in 1972 – a year after the film of the same name was released. Initially designed as a mid-market women's brand, he has said the name came about because he managed to acquire a large shipment of Indian cheesecloth shirts – via a French contact – that could be resold in the UK at a large profit. The business expanded into menswear in 1976. 

In 1978, Nicole Farhi joined French Connection as a designer. In 1983, her eponymous higher-end label was launched by the French Connection parent group and this was not sold until 2010. 

After Marks floated the French Connection brand on the London Stock Exchange in 1984, he was listed as the 15th richest man in Britain, but by the late 1980s the company was in trouble.  He took control of the direction of French Connection again in 1991.

FCUK branding controversy

French Connection began using the branding ""fcuk"" (usually written in lowercase, and deliberately similar to the taboo-word ""fuck"") in advertising  after 1991 when Marks regained control.  Reportedly, the first use of the initialism was on faxes sent between Hong Kong and London offices, headed ""FCHK to FCUK"".  Marks said in a subsequent interview that the faxes were not intended to be rude. The advertising campaign came about after he was so impressed by a bra advert featuring Eva Herzigová that he contacted the advertising executive behind it, Trevor Beattie, even though the company did not have a budget for an advertising campaign at the time. It was Beattie who spotted the marketing potential of the initialism and a campaign was launched around it. 

Use of this term caused widespread controversy due to its similarity to ""fuck"".  

The success of the branding in raising French Connection's profile led to similar tactics from other organisations. French Connection launched a trademark infringement case in the London High Court challenging the owner of ""First Consultants UK Ltd"", a computer company, over its use of the ""fcuk"" initialism. The case found that the Internet Domain fcuk.com was registered prior to French Connection applying for the UK Trademark and its claim for passing off was dismissed. Mr Justice Rattee refused to grant an injunction, describing French Connection's use of the initialism as ""a tasteless and obnoxious campaign.""   The company threatened legal action against the political youth organisation Conservative Future, which had briefly adopted the spoof abbreviation ""cfuk"" (short for ""Conservative Future UK""). 

Following a number of complaints about advertising campaigns using the initialism, the UK's Advertising Standards Authority requested that the company submit all poster campaigns for approval before running them. In the United States, the American Family Association urged a boycott of fcuk products.  French Connection stopped using the initialism in advertising in 2005, and reduced its profile in its shops.  However it is still used on certain menswear products and in-store branding.  Despite this lowering of the profile, French Connection remains known as ""fcuk"", particularly by the UK press.  In 2016 it was reported that French Connection was to bring back its FCUK slogan campaign. 

Brand position

While the revival of the UK brand's fortunes in the 1990s has been attributed to the success of the FCUK logo, it has had mixed financial fortunes during the 2000s, reflected in its poor share prices in the UK.  After reportedly losing market share to rivals such as Zara, Topshop and ASOS – with some analysts suggesting its pricing was out of step with other competitor brands – its position improved in 2014.  the French Connection brand had 131 stores in the UK and Europe. 

Worldwide operation

French Connection distributes its branded womenswear and menswear through a network of owned stores, through franchised stores in major markets around the world, through concessions in department stores in the UK and also through other multi-brand retailers. French Connection also has a variety of licensed products,including eyeglasses, sunglasses, toiletries, shoes, jewellery and watches, which are sold through its own stores and specialist retailers, such as Boots and Specsavers. 

Other brands in group

French Connection represents the majority of French Connection Group's revenue (some 88 per cent in 2014), however it owns a number of other clothing/homewear brands, including YMC, Great Plains and TOAST.  Toast now has eleven UK stores. 

Perfumes

French Connection has produced perfumes as an extension to the main clothing brand. This is a partial list 
* Eau de Fcuk No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 – men's range introduced 2000 and women's perfumes in 2001.
* Fcuk Her and Fcuk Him (2003) – Original women's perfume by Zirh/Shiseido and men's perfume by James Krivda.
* Fcuk Connect Her and Fcuk Connect Him (2007) – Men's and women's ranges with base notes including musk. 
* Fcuk Friction Her and Friction Him (2012) – Women's perfume includes notes of coconut and vanilla, men's includes citrus.

Passage:
Frangipane
Frangipane is a filling made from or flavored with almonds. Frangipane/frangipani is derived from frangere il pane (Italian for ""that breaks the bread""). This filling can be used in a variety of ways  including cakes and such pastries as the Bakewell tart, Conversation tart, Jesuite and Pithivier. A French spelling from a 1674 cookbook is franchipane with the earliest modern spelling coming from a 1732 confectioners' dictionary. Originally designated as a custard tart flavored by almonds or pistachios it came later to designate a filling that could be used in a variety of confections and baked goods. Frangipane is one of France's many traditional foods associated with Christmas celebration. 

Today it is normally made of butter, sugar, eggs, and ground almonds.

In some anecdotes it was the kind of sweet that the noblewoman Jacopa da Settesoli brought to St. Francis of Assisi in 1226, when he was dying.

On Epiphany, the French cut the King Cake, a round cake made of frangipane layers into slices to be distributed by a child known as le petit roi (the little king) who is usually hiding under the dining table.  The cake is decorated with stars, a crown, flowers and a special bean hidden inside the cake.  Whoever gets the piece of the frangipane cake with the bean is crowned “king” or “queen” for the following year.

Etymology

Frangipane/frangipani derived from frangere il pane from which the noble Frangipani family of Rome derived its name in the 11th century. A certain Frangipane was perfumier to Louis XIII of France, hence the common name of the flowering tropical trees that are actually in the genus Plumeria. Other people believe it's derived from St. Francis; pane is Italian for bread and Frangi would have been the cognomen of St. Francis.

Other uses

Frangipane can also refer to:
* A Belgian almond pastry tart.
*: Usually the individual cakes have a striped pattern on top,  occasionally with icing (resembling a hot cross bun from above).
* The frangipane (frangipani, Plumeria) tree as in John Vanderslice's song Kookaburra
Question:
What traditionally provides the flavour/flavor in a frangipane cake filling?
Answer:
Almond tree
Passage:
Million Dollar Mermaid
Million Dollar Mermaid (also known as The One Piece Bathing Suit in the UK) is a 1952 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer biographical musical film of the life of Australian swimming star Annette Kellerman. It was directed by Mervyn LeRoy and produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr. from a screenplay by Everett Freeman. The music score was by Adolph Deutsch, the cinematography by George J. Folsey and the choreography by Busby Berkeley. 

George J. Folsey received a 1953 Oscar nomination for  Best Cinematography, Color. 

The film stars Esther Williams, Victor Mature, and Walter Pidgeon, with David Brian and Donna Corcoran.

Plot

In the late 19th Century, a polio-stricken Australian girl, Annette Kellerman (Esther Williams), swims as a means to improve her health. Her father, Frederick (Walter Pidgeon), who owns a music conservatory, accepts a teaching position in England.

Aboard ship, Annette encounters the American promoter James Sullivan (Victor Mature) and his associate Doc Cronnol (Jesse White), who are taking a boxing kangaroo called Sydney with them to London.

The teaching position falls through and Jimmy suggests promoting Annette in a six-mile swim to Greenwich. She volunteers to make it 26 miles instead. Word spreads of the swim and Annette's feat makes news.

Jimmy suggests they can make a fortune by going to New York and appearing in a water ballet at the Hippodrome.   Manager Alfred Harper (David Brian) does not offer them a job in the show, so Annette goes to Boston for a highly publicized swim and gets in hot water for wearing a one-piece suit too revealing for its time.

She and Jimmy have a misunderstanding and part ways. Harper has a change of heart and makes Annette headliner of his New York show. After the death of her father, she travels to Montauk at the behest of Doc to try to dissuade Jimmy from flying in an air race with a $50,000 prize. It does not go well.

As time passes, Harper falls in love with Annette while she travels to Hollywood to make a film. Jimmy and Doc turn up, this time promoting a dog called Rin Tin Tin that they hope to star in the movies.

A water tank bursts during the making of Annette's film, causing her serious injury, Spinal Hematoma. With her future in doubt, Harper steps aside when he sees for himself how much Annette and Jimmy are in love.

Cast 

* Esther Williams as Annette Kellerman 
* Victor Mature as James Sullivan 
* Walter Pidgeon as Frederick Kellerman 
* David Brian as Alfred Harper 
* Donna Corcoran as Annette Kellerman at age 10

* Charles Watts as Policeman on Revere Beach 
* Wilton Graff as Garvey the Producer 
* Frank Ferguson as Boston Prosecutor 
* James Bell as Boston Judge 
* James Flavin as Train conductor 
* Willis Bouchey as Movie director

Production

MGM signed a deal with Kellerman to make a film based on her life in 1951. It was originally called The One Piece Suit. 

Kellerman thought Williams was ""too beautiful"" to play her and thought Victor Mature's depiction of Jimmy Sullivan was ""the antithesis"" of the character in real life (""he never did anything cheap""). 

The title

Million Dollar Mermaid not only became Esther Williams' nickname around Hollywood, but it became the title of her autobiography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1999), co-written with Digby Diehl. Williams has often called this her favorite film. 

Release

According to MGM records the film earned $2,851,000 in the US and Canada and $2,096,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $243,000.

Home media

On October 6, 2009, Turner Entertainment released Million Dollar Mermaid on DVD as part of the Esther Williams Spotlight Collection, Volume 2. The 6 disc set was a follow up to the company's Esther Williams Spotlight Collection, Volume 1, and contains digitally remastered versions of several of Williams's films including Thrill of a Romance (1945), Fiesta (1947), This Time for Keeps (1947), Pagan Love Song (1950) and Easy to Love (1953).

Cumberland sauce
Cumberland sauce is a fruit sauce, usually used on non-white meats, such as venison, ham, and lamb. Coming out of the long-standing medieval tradition of piquant spicy fruit sauces rendered sharply sour with verjuice or vinegar and served with meat, but created sometime in the 19th century,  the sauce appears in various editions of Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management. It was named for the Duke of Cumberland, who had ties to Hanover, Germany, where the sauce was invented, according to Alexis Soyer's recipe in The Gastronomic Regenerator  (1846) for a port-wine based sauce accompanying boar’s head, which Janet Clarkson notes ""contains what we think of as the required citrus note in the form of Seville orange rind (along with mustard)."" 
It is a more complex version of a simple redcurrant sauce

Despite its German origin, today the sauce is ubiquitous in the Cumbria region of England and is thought of as a thoroughly British condiment.

Although variations exist, common ingredients include red currants or cowberries, port or claret, dry mustard, pepper, orange, ginger, red currant jelly and vinegar.

In wood construction, there are three types of purlin: principal, common and through. Principal purlins are supported by the roof, common purlins by common rafters and through purlins. Common purlin is the most common type of timber used in the U.S. and other parts of the world. It is also the most commonly used type of structure in the UK, where it is called a ""common purlin"" or ""common"" in English. It can be used to refer to any of a number of different types of timber, as well as a variety of other types of structure. For more information on common and common purlin, visit: http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/29/science/pullin/index.html#storylink=cpy. The most common common type is the ""common purlin"", which is used in wood construction to support common parts of a roof, such as the rafters, the roof and the roof joists. The term common purlin is used to describe a type of wood structure that is common in the United States, Canada and other countries. It means that the same material is used for both common and separate pursuit of the common purlins, but with a different name. For example, the word common  purlin refers to the common part of a building's roof joist, which is often referred to as the ""front edge"" or the ""back edge"" of the joist. The common name for a common principal purlin is ""the front edge of the roof"" or the ""backside"" of a jointer, or ""the backside of the front edge"" It can also mean that the front and back sides of the same jointer are the same, or that the jointer is the same as the front of the back of the main jointer. The name common urlin is often used to mean that it is common to use the same type of jointer for both main and secondary pulpins. The Cruel Sea is a 1951 novel by Nicholas Monsarrat. It follows the lives of a group of Royal Navy sailors fighting the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The novel, based on the author's experience of serving in corvettes in the North Atlantic, gives a matter-of-fact but moving portrayal of ordinary men learning to fight and survive in a violent, exhausting battle against the elements and a ruthless enemy. The sketches in this section reference terminology commonly used in the UK and Australia. In architecture, where in a house would you find a purlin? Your answer: The Roof. The Roof is a traditionally framed timber queen post roof showing the placement of principal purlins or purlin plates supporting common rafters. In the UK, the term purlin is used to refer to a timber frame construction showing the position of under purlins. The Oxford Dictionary suggests a French origin, with the earliest quote using a variation of purlin in 1447.

""Three Times a Lady"" is a song by American soul group the Commodores, from their 1978 album Natural High. It was also the only Motown song to reach the Top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 that year. The song was included as the final track on Lionel Richie's greatest hits compilation album Back To Front, released in 1992. It has also been covered by country singer Billy Craddock and in 2007 by Cobra Starship as an iTunes track for their album La Cobra! In 2001 it was covered by Anglo-Norwegian boy band ""No More More"" The song is also featured as an instrumental on The Shadows of the Moonlight (1986) The Cruel Sea was written by Nicholas Monsarrat, who spent the war in anti-submarine escort ships, rising to the rank of Lieutenant-Commander. His first book, Three Corvettes, was published in 1945. After the war he was a publicity officer at British missions overseas (notably Ottawa) before becoming a full-time writer. The novel was made into the film The Cruel sea in 1953, directed by Charles Frend and starring Jack Hawkins as Commander Ericson and Donald Sinden as Lockhart. In September 1980, a two-hour  dramatised version starred Richard Pasco as Erics on and Michael N. Harbour as Lock Hart. In March 2012, another two hour version, starred Gwilym Lee as LockHart and Jonathan Coy as Ericon. Dramatised by John Fletcher and directed by Marc Beeby, this adaptation went on to win 'Best Use of Sound in an Audio Drama' in the BBC Audio Drama Awards 2013. In an appearance on The Early Show on June 12, 2009, Lionel Richie said he was inspired to write the song because of a comment his father made about his mother. His father said to his mother ""I love you I want you. I need you Forever"" hence the three times a lady. In the film adaptation, the ship is called Saltash Castle and is portrayed by the Castle class corvette HMS Portchester Castle, as no River class vessels were available. The ship returns to port as a guard to several German submarines that have surrendered. In chapter seven the ship receives a message ordering it to ""remain on patrol in vicinity of Rockall"" as the end of the Second World War approaches. Conway Twitty's version reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in the late winter of 1984. Kenny Rogers covered the song on After Dark. On 11 April 2013, on occasion of the building's 125th anniversary, Queen Beatrix bestowed the Royal Title ""Koninklijk"" upon the building, as she did previously (in 1988) to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. The hall opened on 11 April 1888 with an inaugural concert, in which an orchestra of 120 musicians and a chorus of 500 singers participated. It is considered one of the finest concert halls in the world, along with places such as Boston's Symphony Hall and the Musikverein in Vienna. The Main Hall (Grote Zaal) seats 1,974, and is 44 metres (144 ft) long. Its reverberation time is 2.8 seconds without audience, 2.2 seconds with, making it ideal for the late Romantic repertoire such as Mahler. The smaller, oval-shaped venue, the Recital Hall (Kleine Zaal), is located behind the Main Hall. Its more intimate space is well-suited for chamber music and Lieder. It hosts not only orchestral and operatic performances, but also jazz and world music. In the 1960s, groups such as Led Zeppelin, The Who and Pink Floyd performed there in the. 1960s. It was built in 1883 in a pasture that was then outside the city, in Nieuwer-Amstel, a municipality that in 1964 became Amstelveen. A total of 2,186 piles of length twelve to thirteen metres (40 to 43 ft), were sunk into the soil. The architect of the. building was Adolf Leonard van Gendt, who was inspired by the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, built two years earlier (and destroyed in 1943). The hall's acoustics were something of a black ship ship, as designers drew upon what had been done in the past without entirely understanding the science. During later restorations, particular care has been taken to alter the materials used for interior decoration with this in mind. In 1980s, extensive fund-raising for renovations after the hall was fou-raising. was embarked on. The Recital. Hall has 437 seats, and the Recitals Hall has four37 seats. The Concertgebouw is one of the most-visited concert halls in the world. It is mentioned, along with Madison Square Garden, the Hollywood Bowl, and the Rainbow Theatre, in the song ""Rock Show"" from the 1975 Wings album Venus and Mars. The organ was built in 1890 by the organ builder Michael Maarschalkerweerd from Utrecht. Josephine Wayne (born Josephine Alicia Saenz; May 13, 1908 – June 24, 2003) was the first wife of American film actor John Wayne. She had four children including film producer Michael Wayne and actor Patrick Wayne. The couple had differences of opinion about how their children should be raised. In 1943 they separated and eventually divorced in 1945. She found great happiness when she married Cyril Nigg (died March, 1999 ), a known businessman, who shared her love of Los Angeles. She died in 2003, at age 95, from cancer, having been predeceased by two of her children, Michael and Toni Toni Morris (Michael Morris had also had three wives, Esperanza Baur and Pilar Palilar).

'Pangrammatic' verses are far older than the thirteenth century. Some clubs have won four competitions in a single season. Liverpool achieved this in 2001, winning all competitions entered with the exception of the domestic league title. Barcelona won six titles in 2009 (Copa del Rey, La Liga, UEFA Champions League, Supercopa de España, and FIFA Club World Cup) This has been described as a'sextuple'; over the course of two different seasons, winning a treble in the 2008–09 season was counted together by many as the three extra matches were played in the same calendar year. Bayern Munich won five trophies in 2013 (everything but the DFL-Supercup) and six in a season in 2011 (all but the Copa del Rey) and 2015 ( all but 2015 SupercopA de EspAña) The list below considers only teams whose victories include trophies in the top tier of their league system. Winning multiple competitions is seen as a particularly momentous achievement. By contrast, winning four or more trophies in one season is exceptionally rare. In recent years, the terms quadruple, quintuple and sextuple have come to be occasionally used to refer to winning four, five or six top-tier trophies in aSingle season. A pangram is a sentence containing all the letters of the alphabet. It is an attempt to get the maximum number of different letters into a sentence of minimum length. Tines or prongs or teeth are parallel or branching spikes forming parts of a tool or natural object. They may be made of metal, wood, bone or other hard, strong material. A tooth of a comb is a tine. The term ""tine"" is also used for mountains, such as the fictional Silvertine in The Lord of the Rings. The number of tines (also written tynes) on tools varies widely – a pitchfork may have just two, a garden fork may have four, and a rake or harrow many. A prong of a fork is called tine (structural) or subtines (archaic) Tines and prongs occur in nature—for example, forming the branched bony antlers of deer or the forked horns of pronghorn antelopes. ""You"" was the 9th single released by UK pop group S Club 7 on 11 February 2002. The track is a very uptempo-retro number reminiscent of the group's third single ""You're My Number One"". The video was set in the 1950s and is described in the Best CD booklet as the ""candyfloss-bright, tongue-in-cheek 50s pastiche"" This track was the last single to feature departed band member Paul Cattermole. The song reached no. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. It also charted on the 2002 Year End Singles chart at number 70. The music video for 'You' was filmed after ""Don't Stop Movin'"" and was intended as the follow up single before the group were asked to record the Children In Need single ('Have You Ever') for that year. Harry Hole is the main character in a series of crime novels written by Norwegian author Jo Nesbø. Hole is a brilliant and driven detective with unorthodox methods, a classic loose cannon in the police force. He lost his mother, a descendant of the Sami people, to cancer while he was in his twenties, and he has never had a close relationship to his father, Olav Hole, a former teacher. He is unmarried, but has had close relationships with a number of women throughout the series of ten novels. He has few close friends – and the ability to make enemies from amongst his colleagues who, nevertheless, grudgingly respect him. The effects of his problem sometimes bring him into repeated conflict with his superiors and some colleagues, but Bjarne Møller, head of Hole's department and one of his closest friends, manages to prevent him from being sacked as a result. He also has a younger sister with Down syndrome, and has never been close with his father. His best friend is Gunnar Hagen, his former colleague at the Oslo Police Department who is also friends with Bjørn Holm, another skilled forensics officer, and Bjørne Beate Lønn, a police forensics specialist. He often uses Beate to secure crucial information in critical situations where he is required to secure vital information. The video stars Rachel Stevens as a wife who cooks food for her husband. The smoke from the grill show the other 6 members dancing under umbrellas. Rachel is sad until the others sing to her. Harry Hole (pronounced Holy) is a detective from Oslo, Norway. The author's home city of Oslo has the starring role in the Harry Hole novels. Much of the background detail of the stories involves real locations, and the city is shown ""warts and all"" Harry Hole's home address is in Sofies Gate in Bislett, Oslo. Near his place of residence is his favourite ""watering hole"", Restaurant Schrøder (Schrøder's, for short) in St. Hanshaugen, which figures in most of the novels. Harry Hole is the name of a historic Norwegian town (Hole, Norway), with a heritage that goes back to Norway's origins in the Viking Age. The name is derived from Old Norse Hólar, the plural form of hóll, meaning ""round (and isolated) hill"". The word is pronounced as two syllables, with stress on the first (hoh-leh), as is implied in The Bat, where the Australian police call him ""Harry Holy"". In Police (2013), Hole is needed once again to discover the identity of a serial killer who is stalking the streets of Oslo, killing police officers who previously investigated old cases. He has had a serious relationship with Rakel Fauke, whose son, Oleg, looks up to Harry as a father figure. After the case chronicled in The Snowman, their relationship is put under severe pressure. In The Leopard (2009), Hole returns from self-imposed exile in Hong Kong and unofficially investigates aserial killer. In Cockroaches (1998) Hole tracks an assassin planning an attack on a prominent member of the establishment. In Nemesis (2002), Hole investigates a fatal bank robbery and becomes implicated in the apparent murder of an ex-girlfriend. In Phantom (2011), Hole again returns from Hong Kong to look into a murder apparently committed by his would-be son, oleg, in Oslo's drug scene. The novels are written in Norwegian, with English translations by Don Bartlett: The Redbreast (2000) and Panserhjerte (2009) and by Gjenferd; English translation: The Leopard: The Politi (2011) and Politi: The Police (2012) (English translation: Politi) (2013) (Question: Which author created the detective Harry Hole? Fuse in a plug is a safety device designed to protect the lead rather than the appliance. It is a deliberate weak link in a circuit which will 'blow' if an electrical appliance or extension lead draws too much current due to either an overload or a fault. The blown fuse cuts off the electricity to stop the lead and appliance from overheating and causing a fire. Plugs for appliances rated up to about 700 watts should have a 3 amp fuse (coloured red) and plugs for appliances between 700 watts and 3000 watts should be fitted with a 13 amp fuse. (Some older appliances were fitted with 5 amp fuses, which are still available to buy.) Theakston is an English brewery located in the market town of Masham, North Yorkshire. The company is the sixteenth largest brewer in the UK by market share, and the second largest brewer under family ownership after Shepherd Neame. It produces cask ale and pasteurised bottled ales. Its cask ales are widely available in pubs in the north of England, though are less common in other parts of the country. Its bottled beers are also widely distributed to British supermarkets and exported to Germany and the United States. It was founded in 1827 by Robert Theakstone and John Wood at The Black Bull pub and brewhouse in Masham. It has been owned and operated by the government since 1916 and is now owned by Scottish & Newcastle's Tyne Brewery. In 2004 the business returned to family ownership. Major development works at the Masham Brewery enabled the company to announce that brewing of Theakstons Bitter would return to Masham in 2009. Theakton Best Bitter (3.8% ABV) is regularly paired with XB (4.5% ABV). It was launched in 1982 and is the company's most easily found product, served in many pubs, mainly in the North of England. It's a premium strength. premium strength Bitter with a more complex flavour.      ""Barnley's Bitter"" (Black Bull Bitter) (9.9% ABV - April 1992–May 2011) is a more. complex flavour than XB in pubs, and is often paired with. Barnsley's. Bitter. (2.7% ABV – April 1992 – May 2011) Traditional Mild (3.5% ABV) is the weakest beer produced by Theakston. Lightfoot Bitter (4.1%abv) originally brewed as a seasonal bitter but with its high popularity has become one of many regular Theakstons brew. Old Peculier has been made under this name since the 1890s. In 2000, it won the silver medal in the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA)'s ""Champion Winter Beer of Britain"" 2000 competition. In 1985 The Economist dubbed it the ""doyen of real ales"" The six seasonal ales are Cooper's Butt, Hogshead Bitter, Grouse Beater, Masham Ale, Paradise Ale and Paradise Ale. The brewery also runs a small visitor centre at its home in Masham where guided tours are given about the actual working brewery. Visitors are given tokens that can be exchanged for drinks at the bar of the Black Bull in Paradise, named after the original pub (Black Bull) and the location of the new brewery (Paradise Fields) There is also a small shop, selling crates of bottled XB and Old PECulier, beer glasses, T-shirts and an assortment of other souvenirs.""I Whistle a Happy Tune"" is a show tune from the 1951 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, The King and I. It is sung by Anna Leonowens to her son Louis after the curtain rises on Act One of the musical, to persuade him not to be afraid as they arrive in Siam to serve the King. In the All Creatures Great and Small episode ""Golden Lads & Girls"", James Herriot and Tristan Farnon are seen drinking a Theakson Nutty Brown Ale.

The painting ‘Benefits Supervisor Resting Supervisor’ sold for £35.8million at Christie’s in 2008 to Roman Abramovich, which was broken by the. Roman Abramovitch painting Resting. Resting was exhibited twice at Flowers:1996: Naked – East at London at London. It held the record for the highest price paid for a painting by a living artist when it was sold for  £17.6 million at Christie's in New York in May 2008. In 2015, the painting sold for $56.2million at auction. The song was published first as ""'Till the Boys Come Home"" on 8 October 1914 by Ascherberg, Hopwood and Crew Ltd. in London. The song became very popular in the United Kingdom during the war, along with It's a Long Way to Tipperary. James F. Harrison recorded Keep the Home-Fires Burning in 1915, as did Stanley Kirkby in 1916. Other versions include one by Frederick J. Wheeler and one by the duet Reed Miller & Frederick Wheeler. The main chorus is sung by the cast of M*A*S*H in Episode 127 (Season 5) ""War of Nerves"" during a stress relief ""bon-type-fire"" The song is briefly heard in a scene of new army recruits marching in a parade in the 1930 film A Soldier's Plaything. In the 1981 film Chariots of Fire, the song is featured in the film Johnny Got His Gun when the characters are celebrating a Christmas party; this clip was later used at the end of Metallica's music video, ""One"" In the Seán O'Casey play The Plough and the Stars, the last refrain is sung in the episode ""Camping In."" In the 1969 musical Oh! What a Lovely War and in the 1970 musical film Darling Lili, the lyrics are: ""Keep the Home Fires Burning, while your hearts are yearning. Through the dark clouds shining, turn the dark cloud inside out'Til the boys come home"" The lead chamber process was an industrial method used in large quantities to produce sulfuric acid. It has been largely supplanted by the contact process used in the 1746 production of lead-lined lead. So robust was the process that it remained the standard method of production for almost two centuries. It was the robust process that allowed the effective industrialization of sulfuric Acid to be used in lead chambers, which were less expensive, and could be made larger than the glass containers which had been previously used. The process was the basis for the production of the song Keep the home fire burning. The lyrics were written by Lena Guilbert Ford (whose middle name was sometimes printed as ""Gilbert"") with words by Ivor Novello. There is a misconception that Ivor's mother wrote the lyrics for the song (propagated by patter in recorded performances of British musical comedy duo Hinge and Bracket) but Lena Ford (an American) was a friend and collaborator of Noveello, not a blood relation. Sulfur dioxide is introduced with steam and nitrogen oxide into large chambers lined with sheet lead. The sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide dissolve and over a period of approximately 30 minutes the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfuric acid. The presence of nitrogen dioxide is necessary for the reaction to proceed at a reasonable rate. The process is highly exothermic, and a major consideration of the design of the chambers was to provide a way to dissipate the heat formed in the reactions. The recovery and reuse of oxides of nitrogen was an important economic consideration in the operation of a chamber process plant.hat as late as 1946, the chamber process still accounted for 25% of sulfuric Acid manufactured. In the early period of manufacture, nitrogen oxides were produced by the decomposition of niter at high temperature in the presence of acid, but this process was gradually supplanted by the air oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide. Later versions of chamber plants included a high-temperature Glover tower to recover the nitrogen Oxides from the chamber liquor, while concentrating the chamber acid to as much as 78% H2SO4. Exhaust gases from the chambers are scrubbed by passing into a tower through which some of the Glover acid flows over broken tile. Nitrogen oxides are absorbed to form nitrosylsulfuric acid, which is then returned to the Glover Tower to reclaim the oxides. The reaction is hydrated to produce nitrous acid which then oxidizes to sulfur dioxide in the reaction chambers. The reactions are well charactered and well characted, and are well-characterized by the use of the term ""chamber process"" to refer to the process. The chamber process was first used by the French chemist Gay-Lussac in the mid-19th century, and then by Mills-Packard in the early 20th century. The chambers were tall tapered cylinders that were externally cooled by water flowing down the outside surface of the chamber. They were redesigned as stoneware packed masonry cylinders in the late 19th century and the early 21st century. They are still used today by some chemical companies to produce sulfuric acids and other industrial chemicals, but they are now being phased out. Chris Andrews is an English singer-songwriter. His hits include ""Girl Don't Come"", ""I'll Stop at Nothing"", ""Message Understood"" and ""Long Live Love"" His hits are seen as early examples of reggae influenced white pop music. ""Yesterday Man"" was used as the theme for RTÉ's long-running TV programme, The Late Late Show, until 1999, and a re-arranged version returned as the show's theme music in September 2009. ""Yo Yo"" reached No. 7 at the end of 1970. Andrews remains active in his career as a singer- songwriter, working primarily in continental Europe and in the United Kingdom. He lives with his second wife Alexandra, who is also his manager, in Germany and Spain. He is married to his third wife, Alexandra, and they have two children, a son and a daughter. He has a son, Chris, who was born in the UK in the early 1960s. He also has a daughter, Charlotte, who lives in the U.S. with her husband, David, and their daughter, Emma, in New York City. His son, Christopher, was born on 15 October 1942, in Romford, Essex, England, and he has two daughters, Charlotte and Emma. He currently lives in London with his wife Alexandra and their children, Emma and Charlotte. He and his wife have two sons, Chris and David, who live in London and New York, as well as a son-in-law, Chris Ravel, who also lives in Soho, London. Andrews has three children, David Ravel and Emma Ravel-Andrews, Jr., and a step-daughter, Emily Ravel. He was married in the late 1950s, and has two step-children, Emily and David. He had a son in 2010, Christopher Andrews-Smith, Jr, who has a wife and daughter, Emily, and daughter-in law, Emily Shaw-Smith. Andrews is also the father of singer-Songwriter Adam Faith, who recorded under the name Adam Faith. His daughter, Sandie Shaw, had a hit with ""The First Time"" (No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart, 1963) and ""We Are in Love"" (no. 11, 1964), and then a string of hits with ""Pretty Belinda"" (1969), ""Carol OK"" (both 1970) all topping the charts there. Andrews also had hits in Germany, Ireland and Germany, including ""To Whom It Concerns"" in 1965. Janet Horne was an alleged witch from Scotland and the last person to be executed for witchcraft in the British Isles. She was stripped, smeared with tar, paraded through the town on a barrel and burned alive. Nine years after her death the witchcraft acts were repealed in Scotland. The events of the story are the subject of the song ""Am I Evil?"" by heavy metal band Diamond Head. Blue Peter Music Makers gave 40 young musicians the chance to get involved in recording a new version of the theme tune 'Barnacle Bill' Mike Oldfield is the man who inspired Murray Gold to become a composer. The track is one of the best known pieces of music on TV and has been used on the programme since the first ever episode in 1958. The company became notorious for the use of the ""fcuk"" initialism in its advertising campaigns in the early 2000s. French Connection (also branded as FCUK) is a UK-based global retailer and wholesaler of fashion clothing, accessories and homeware. It is based in London and its parent French Connection Group PLC is listed on the London Stock Exchange. Other brands currently within the group include Great Plains, Toast and YMC. In 1978, Nicole Farhi joined French Connection as a designer. In 1976, the company expanded into menswear via a cheese business via a brand called YM.o.3 in ’65 with a title whose initials were YM (pronounced ‘The Middleman’). The company was founded by Stephen Marks, who started out in 1969 as the Stephen Marks brand, and established French Connection in 1972 – a year after the film of the same name was released. The name French Connection came about because he managed to acquire a large shipment of Indiancloth shirts – which could be resold in the UK at a large profit – via The Middleman. The brand was later renamed French Connection PLC, which was founded in 1995. The group is now based in Paris and has a turnover of more than £1.5 billion. It was founded as a mid-market women’s brand in 1969 and is now a global brand with stores in the U.S., Canada and the UK. It also has its own website, French Connection.com. Marks floated the French Connection brand on the London Stock Exchange in 1984. He took control of the direction of French Connection again in 1991. French Connection began using the branding ""fcuk"" (usually written in lowercase, and deliberately similar to the taboo-word ""fuck"") in advertising after 1991. The success of the branding in raising French Connection's profile led to similar tactics from other organisations. The company stopped using the initialism in advertising in 2005, and reduced its profile in its shops. However it is still used on certain menswear products and in-store branding. In 2016 it was reported that French Connection was to bring back its FCUK slogan campaign.French Connection represents the majority of the group's revenue (some 88 per cent in 2014), however it owns a number of other clothing/homewear brands, including YMC, Great Plains and TOAST. The brand has had mixed financial fortunes during the 2000s, reflected in its poor share prices in the UK. After reportedly losing market share to rivals such as Zara, Topshop and ASOS – with some analysts suggesting its pricing was out of step with other competitor brands – its position improved in 2014.  The brand now has 131 stores in the US, Europe and the Middle East. It also has a variety of licensed products, including eyeglasses, sunglasses, toiletries, shoes, jewellery and watches, which are sold through its own stores and specialist retailers, such as Boots and Specsavers. Its eponymous higher-end label was launched by French Connection parent group and this was not sold until 2010.

Frangipane is a filling made from or flavored with almonds. It is derived from frangere il pane (Italian for ""that breaks the bread""). This filling can be used in a variety of ways including cakes and such pastries as the Bakewell tart, Conversation tart, Jesuite and Pithivier. A French spelling from a 1674 cookbook is franchipane with the earliest modern spelling coming from a 1732 confectioners' dictionary. A certain Frangipani was perfumier to Louis XIII of France, hence the common name of the flowering tropical trees that are actually in the genus Plumeria. Other people believe it's derived from St. Francis; pane is Italian for bread and Frangi would have been the cognomen of St.Francis. A Belgian almond pastry tart is normally made of butter, sugar, eggs, and ground almonds. Usually the individual cakes have a striped pattern on top,  occasionally with icing (resembling a hot cross bun from above). The frangipan tree is also used in John Vanderslice’s song Kookaburra. It’ is a flowering tropical tree that is found in the French Alps. It can also be used to refer to: “The One Piece Bathing Suit”, a 1952 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer biographical musical film of the life of Australian swimming star Annette Kellerman. It was directed by Mervyn LeRoy and produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr. from a screenplay by Everett Freeman. The music score was by Adolph Deutsch, the cinematography by George J. Folsey and the choreography by Busby Berkeley. It received a 1953 Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography, Color, Mature, with Esther Williams, Victor Williams and Walter Pidgeon, with David Corcoran. The film is about an Australian girl who takes a boxing position with them to London to improve her health. She falls through a hole in the hull of a ship and encounters the American promoter James Sullivan (Victor M. Sullivan) and his associate Doc Cronnolse (Jesse White) who are taking her to London for a teaching position in a conservatory. It's also known as the Million Dollar Mermaid (also known as The One PieceBathing Suit in the UK) The film was released in 1952 and starred Esther Williams and Victor Williams. The soundtrack was written by George Gershwin and the music was by John M. Deutsch. Esther Williams played Annette Kellerman in the 1951 MGM film Million Dollar Mermaid. The film earned $2,851,000 in the US and Canada. Williams has often called this her favorite film.

Cumberland sauce is a fruit sauce, usually used on non-white meats, such as venison, ham, and lamb. It was named for the Duke of Cumberland, who had ties to Hanover, Germany. It is a more complex version of a simple redcurrant sauce. Common ingredients include red currants or cowberries, port or claret, dry mustard, pepper, orange, ginger, red currant jelly and vinegar. The sauce is thought of as a thoroughly British condiment. It has its origins in the 19th century, when it was invented in Hanover. It's now popular in the Cumbria region of England, where it is known as the 'Cumberlands' It's also popular in Scotland, where the 'Ridgeway' is the main way to get to the Yorkshire Wolds and the North Sea coast. The South West Coast Path is the UK's longest path, with over 4000 km of trails. It runs from the south coast to the north coast of England."

How to Make Triple Sec
Posted by Shelly Bowen on Oct 8, 2009 in Handcrafted Mixers , How to ... | No Comments
When it comes to mixing fantastic drinks, fewer things make it better than having the best ingredients on hand. Triple sec or orange liqueur (or Grand Marnier or Cointreau, both orange liqueurs) is widely used in many classics, so we made own special version.
What does triple sec taste like? Triple sec is a sweet orange citrus liqueur. Our homemade triple sec tastes heavily of oranges and orange peel, like orange hard candy. Some triple secs are not as potently orange tasting.
This recipe comes from Charlie Hodges at the Ace Hotel, Palm Springs, via Imbibe Magazine‘s Fall 2009 issue. Read through the steps and you’ll see that you can multitask to speed up the process.
Here’s what you need to make triple sec:
4 small navel oranges
12 oz. Everclear grain alcohol
12 oz. vodka
12 oz. can of Mandarin orange slices
5 cups cane sugar
Orange blossom water
Get all your triple sec ingredients together, then:
Heat oven to lowest temperature setting, generally around 180ºF – 200ºF. Slice the oranges into 1/8″ thick wheels and lay out on a baking tray. Bake oranges until sticky and gummy but not dried, about 1-2 hours.
Drain the can of Mandarin oranges and place in a jar with the vodka to infuse for about 24 hours or until it tastes strongly of the oranges.
Combine the baked orange slices with the Everclear and infuse for 8 hours, stirring occasionally.
Make the simple syrup combining the sugar and water and stirring over medium heat until dissolved.
Finally, strain all liquid ingredients through a fine sieve and combine with the syrup. Stir and add a few dashes of orange blossom water to taste. Bottle it up and it keeps refrigerated for about a month.
Ready to mix? Here are some mixed drink recipes that call for triple sec.

Geography
Hong          Kong island sits just south of the Tropic of Cancer on similar latitudes          as Calcutta, Havana, and Hawaii, and sharing the same longitude as Wuhan          in central China, Bali, and Perth. Surrounding the country's southern          coast is the South China Sea.
The country consists of a peninsular protruding from southeastern China and hundreds          of islands scattered off the coast. Kowloon and the New Territories make          up the peninsular, while south off the mainland is Hong Kong Island and          various other remote islands.
Deep waters          surround Hong Kong, and with its wide harbors protected by mountains in          the north and south, the region is favorable as a passing point for ships.          Its geographical location between the Taiwan Straits, the South China          Sea, and the Pacific Ocean make it a strategic channel for sea traffic          in Asia and the world.
Size
Hong Kong          is a small-sized island covering 1,095 sq. km (423 sq. miles). However,          there are currently many reclamation projects at hand, thus expanding          the land area. Hong Kong never used to be as big as it is now. From 1851          to 1997, the total area of land reclaimed from the sea measured to 60          sq. km (23 sq. miles). In area, the island of Hong Kong is 80 sq. km (31          sq. miles), Kowloon peninsular is 47 sq. km (18 sq. miles), the New Territories          is 794 sq. km (306 sq. miles), and the remote islands total 175 sq. km          (67 sq. miles).
Topography
Hong Kong          stands on volcanic terra firma, with its landscape dominated by hills          and mountains. A crest lining from the northeast to southwest forms the          backbone of Hong Kong. Kowloon peninsular and the northwestern New Territories          are mainly flat areas. Three percent of Hong Kong's total land area is          agriculturally cultivated and this is mostly at the New Territories large          alluvial plains.
A narrow          piece of flat land between the mountains and the sea along the north shore          in Hong Kong is vacated by most of the country's population, whereas the          south shore has luxury residential buildings and some nice beaches, such          as Stanley and Repulse Bays. There is a tunnel that was built through          the mountains, which links the north and south shores.
The highest          peak is Ta Mo Shan, located in central New Territories at 957 meters (3,140          ft) above sea level, while the lowest is Lo Chau Mun at 66 meters (217ft).          Victoria Peak, or 'The Peak', is only 552 meters (1,811ft) but its spectacular          view of Victoria Harbour, Kowloon, and the Central and Wan Chai strip          of Hong Kong Island has made an international reputation for itself.
In total,          there are about 234 outlying islands in the country, with the island of          Hong Kong being the most famous and populated. Even then, Hong Kong is          not reputed to be the largest island around. Lantau Island is by far the          biggest of Hong Kong's islands. It has now surfaced from its remoteness          to becoming the site of the new, high-tech Chek Lap Kok international          airport.
Although          Hong Kong dwells on volcanic plains, there are only minor seismic activities,          occasionally causing tremors. To date, no major earthquakes have been          reported, but the last that occurred in the region was back in 1874, with          a magnitude of 5.75 on the Richter scale, which caused only minor damages.
Climate
Hong Kong          has a subtropical climate because of the wide temperature range and cooler          winters. Even though Hong Kong's latitude is within the tropics, its seasonal          changes are greater than in most places at similar latitudes. Monsoons          and seasonal alternation of winds often dominate the climatic system of          the country.
Spring occurs          in the months of March to the middle of May. Temperature rises ranges          from 18� to 27�C (64�-80� F) and humidity averages up to 77 percent. Some,          with fog, constant rain and showers, and only a few moments of sunshine,          consider the transitional period from winter to summer miserable. The          average annual rainfall is 2,200 millimeters, with about 80 percent of          the total falling occurring at this period. Higher statures, such as west          of the New Territories and the southern islands, receive more rainfall          than any other areas.
From June          to mid September, summer takes over. The weather becomes hot and humid,          with temperatures ranging from 26� to 33�C (78�-91�F) and humidity level          at above 86 percent. It is advisable to always carry an umbrella or to          wear a hat to shield against intense sunshine.
The best          times to visit Hong Kong would be during autumn and winter when the air          is dry and cool. These times are between the months of mid September to          February. In autumn, clear sunny days are usually expected and temperatures          range from 18� to 28�C (64�-82�F). Humidity averages 72 percent. Winter,          on the other hand, starts from mid December to February. January is normally          the coldest month. Temperatures can drop from 20�C to about 10�C (50�F),          with occasional chills.
Visitors          to Hong Kong during the monsoon period should be wary and prepared with          umbrellas at all times. Dress warmly, or carry along a jacket or sweater          just in case there is a sudden change in weather.

Juliet (moon)
There is also an asteroid called 1285 Julietta.

Juliet (  or ) is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 3 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 2. It is named after the heroine of William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. It is also designated Uranus XI.

Juliet belongs to Portia Group of satellites, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Unfortunately, other than its orbit, radius of 53 km and geometric albedo of 0.08 virtually nothing is known about Juliet.

At the Voyager 2 images Juliet appears as an elongated object, the major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of Juliet's prolate spheroid is 0.5 ± 0.3, which is rather an extreme value. Its surface is grey in color.

Juliet may collide with Desdemona within the next 100 million years.
Question:
Juliet, Cupid and Desdemona are moons of which planet?
Answer:
Magnetosphere of Uranus

2014 Tour de France
The 2014 Tour de France was the 101st edition of the Tour de France. It started on 5 July in Leeds, United Kingdom, and concluded on 27 July in Paris, France.    As is traditionally the case in even-numbered years, it followed a clockwise route through France. Italian cyclist Vincenzo Nibali won the race by more than seven minutes, the biggest winning margin since 1997.  

Teams

All 18 teams in the UCI's Proteam category were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race.  Four UCI Professional Continental teams were also invited. 

Before the start of the race, Chris Froome, Alberto Contador, and Vincenzo Nibali were among the favourites for overall victory.   Froome crashed out of the Tour on stage 5, and Contador followed on stage 10, after breaking his leg in a crash. German rider Jens Voigt competed in his seventeenth and final Tour. 

Grand Départ

The Grand Départ team presentation took place on 3 July in Leeds at the First Direct Arena, after a ceremonial ride from the University of Leeds. The ceremony included performances from Embrace and Opera North. 

Route and stages

The first three stages were in the United Kingdom, starting in Leeds.   This was the fourth Tour de France to contain stages in the United Kingdom (after 1974, 1994 and 2007) and the first edition to contain more than two stages there.

Classification leadership

There are four main individual classifications contested in the 2014 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important is the general classification, which is calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time is the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification will be considered the winner of the Tour.  In 2014, there are no time bonuses given.

The points classification awards a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists get points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points leads the classification, and is identified with a green jersey.

The mountains classification is a special points competition awarded to those riders who climb the most difficult ascents the fastest. The organisation categorises some climbs as either hors catégorie, first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification are won by the first cyclists that reach the top of these climbs, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The rider with the most mountain points is awarded a polka dot jersey. There were also two special awards, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange given to first rider over the highest climb in the Tour and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given to the first rider to pass his memorial on the Col du Tourmalet. They did not award any points for the mountains classification, but gave a cash prize of €5000. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange this year was on the Col d'Izoard in stage 14, and was claimed by Joaquim Rodríguez and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet was won by Blel Kadri on stage 18.

The young rider classification, denoted by a white jersey, is calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification is restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1989.

The team classification is calculated using the finishing times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage; the leading team is the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that lead this classification are identified with yellow numbers and helmets.

In addition, there is a combativity award, given after each stage to the cyclist considered to be the most combative rider that day; it is awarded by a jury vote.  The winner wears red numbers on the back of his jersey the following day. At the conclusion of the Tour de France, the cyclist who has received the most total votes across all stages is recognized as the most combative rider of the entire Tour.

* In stage 2, Bryan Coquard, who was third in the points classification, wore the green jersey, because Marcel Kittel (in first place) wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification  and Peter Sagan (in second place) wore the white jersey as leader of the young riders' classification during that stage
* In stages 3–5, Romain Bardet, who was second in the young riders' classification, wore the white jersey, because Peter Sagan (in first place) wore the green jersey as leader of the points classification. Also, in stages 6–7, Michał Kwiatkowski wore the white jersey for the same reason.
* In stage 14, Joaquim Rodríguez, who was second in the mountains classification, wore the polka-dot jersey, because Vincenzo Nibali (in first place) wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification.

Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis
The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis is the head of London's Metropolitan Police Service, classing the holder as a chief police officer. The post is currently held by Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe after his appointment by the Queen on 12 September 2011.  

The Commissioner is regarded as the highest ranking police officer in the United Kingdom, despite the fact that his authority is generally confined to the Metropolitan Police Service's area of operation, Greater London. However, unlike other police forces the Metropolitan Police has certain national responsibilities such as leading counter-terrorism policing and the protection of the Royal Family and senior members of Her Majesty's Government. Furthermore, the postholder is directly accountable to the Home Secretary and the public nationally amongst many others (the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, the Mayor of London, Londoners) whereas smaller police forces are only accountable to residents and their local Police and Crime Commissioner or police authority.   
The rank is usually referred to as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, the Met Commissioner or simply just ""Commissioner"". The Commissioner's annual salary without pension contributions or allowances from 1 September 2010, is £260,088. 

History

The rank of Commissioner was created by the Metropolitan Police Act 1829; until 1855, the post was held jointly by two officers. The Commissioners were Justices of the Peace and not sworn constables until 1 April 1974.  The title Commissioner was not used until 1839.

The insignia of rank is a crown above a Bath Star, known as ""pips"", above crossed tipstaves within a wreath, very similar to the insignia worn by a full general in the British Army. This badge is all but unique within the British police, shared only with the Commissioner of the City of London Police, the smallest territorial police force, and HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary. Like all chief officer ranks in the British police, commissioners wear gorget patches on the collars of their tunics. The gorget patches are similar to those worn by generals, aside from being of silver-on-black instead of the Army's gold-on-red. 

At one time, the commissioners were either retired military officers or civil servants. Sir John Nott-Bower, who served as Commissioner from 1953 to 1958, was the first career police officer to hold the post, despite several previous Commissioners having served in senior administrative positions in colonial forces, and the Metropolitan Police itself.  Nott-Bower's successor Sir Joseph Simpson was the first Commissioner to have started his career as the lowest rank of Constable. However, Sir Robert Mark, appointed in 1972, was the first to have risen through all the ranks from the lowest to the highest, as all his successors have done.

, the post of Commissioner is appointed for a period of five years. Applicants are appointed to the post by Her Majesty The Queen, following a recommendation by the Home Secretary under the Police Act 1996.

As of 2010 the salary of the Commissioner of the Metropolis is £260,088. 

Eligibility and accountability

, applicants to the post of Commissioner must be British citizens, and be ""serving UK chief constables or of equivalent UK ranks and above, or have recent experience at these levels"". The post of Commissioner is ""accountable to the Home Secretary; to the MPA, chaired by the Mayor of London; and must answer to Londoners and the public nationally."" 

This requirement to be a British national has blocked the appointment of non-British Commissioners in the past. In August 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron wanted former Los Angeles Police Department Chief Bill Bratton to become the new Met Police Commissioner, but this was blocked by the Home Office pointing out that the Commissioner has to be British.  , the requirement is set to be scrapped by a proposal made by the Chief Inspector of Constabulary.

Passage:
The Hay Wain
The Hay Wain is a painting by John Constable, finished in 1821, which depicts a rural scene on the River Stour between the English counties of Suffolk and Essex. It hangs in the National Gallery in London and is regarded as ""Constable's most famous image""  and one of the greatest and most popular English paintings.

Painted in oils on canvas, the work depicts as its central feature three horses pulling a hay wain or large farm cart across the river. Willy Lott's Cottage, also the subject of an eponymous painting by Constable, is visible on the far left. The scene takes place near Flatford Mill in Suffolk, though since the Stour forms the border of two counties, the left bank is in Suffolk and the landscape on the right bank is in Essex.

The Hay Wain is one of a series of paintings by Constable called the ""six-footers"", large-scale canvasses which he painted for the annual summer exhibitions at the Royal Academy. As with all of the paintings in this series Constable produced a full-scale oil sketch for the work; this is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Constable originally exhibited the finished work with the title Landscape: Noon, suggesting that he envisaged it as belonging to the classical landscape tradition of representing the cycles of nature.

History

Flatford Mill was owned by Constable's father. The house on the left side of the painting belonged to a neighbour, Willy Lott, a tenant farmer, who was said to have been born in the house and never to have left it for more than four days in his lifetime. Willy Lott's Cottage has survived to this day practically unaltered, but none of the trees in the painting exist today.

Although The Hay Wain is revered today as one of the greatest British paintings, when it was originally exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821 (under the title Landscape: Noon), it failed to find a buyer. 

It was considerably better received in France where it was praised by Théodore Géricault. The painting caused a sensation when it was exhibited with other works by Constable at the 1824 Paris Salon (it has been suggested that the inclusion of Constable's paintings in the exhibition was a tribute to Géricault, who died early that year). In that exhibition, The Hay Wain was singled out for a gold medal awarded by Charles X of France, a cast of which is incorporated into the picture's frame. The works by Constable in the exhibition inspired a new generation of French painters, including Eugène Delacroix.

Sold at the exhibition with three other Constables to the dealer John Arrowsmith, The Hay Wain was brought back to England by another dealer, D. T. White; he sold it to a Mr Young who resided in Ryde on the Isle of Wight. It was there that the painting came to the attention of the collector Henry Vaughan and the painter Charles Robert Leslie.  On the death of his friend Mr Young, Vaughan bought the painting from the former's estate; in 1886 he presented it to the National Gallery in London, where it still hangs today.  In his will Vaughan bequeathed the full-scale oil sketch for The Hay Wain, made with a palette knife, to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum). 

The Hay Wain was voted the second most popular painting in any British gallery, second only to Turner's Fighting Temeraire, in a 2005 poll organised by BBC Radio 4's Today programme. On 28 June 2013 a protester, reported to be connected with Fathers4Justice, glued a photograph of a young boy to the painting while it was on display at the National Gallery. The work was not permanently damaged.

Whose cottage is on the left of the Constable painting The Hay Wain?

Passage:
Apostle spoon
An apostle spoon is a spoon (usually silver or silver-plated, but sometimes of other metals, such as pewter) with an image of an apostle or other saint as the termination of the handle, each bearing his distinctive emblem. Apostle spoons were particularly popular in Pre-Reformation times when belief in the services of a patron saint was still strong. They symbolize the Last Supper of Christ in the company of the Apostles. Apostle spoons were especially popular in England, but were also found in large numbers in Germany. Fleming, John & Hugh Honour. (1977) The Penguin Dictionary of Decorative Arts.  London: Allen Lane, p. 27. ISBN 0713909412

Origins

Originating in early-fifteenth century in Europe as spoons used at table (often produced in sets of thirteen, the thirteenth, showing Jesus, usually being referred to as the 'Saviour' or 'Master' spoon). The British Museum in London has a set from England dating from 1536–7 which has a figure of the Virgin Mary on the thirteenth spoon.  By the sixteenth century they had become popular as baptismal presents for godchildren, but were dying out by the 1660s.  In some communities this tradition continued until at least the mid-twentieth century.

They first appeared as a bequest in the will of one Amy Brent who, in 1516,  bequeathed ""XIII sylver spones of J' hu and the XII Apostells."" They are alluded to by the dramatists Ben Johnson, Thomas Middleton, Francis Beaumont, and John Fletcher. Shakespeare refers to it in Henry VIII, Act 5, Scene 3, where Cranmer declines to be sponsor for the infant Elizabeth because of his lack of money. King Henry banters him with ""Come, come, my lord, you'ld spare your spoons."" 

Sets of the twelve apostles are not common, and complete sets of thirteen, with the figure of Jesus on a larger spoon, are still rarer.

The spoon shown opposite is typical of single spoons not part of a set.  In this case the apostle is simply holding what appears to be a book. Such examples would typically be in electroplated nickel silver and marked on the rear face with ""EPNS.""

Attributes

Apostle spoons can be known by the attribute mentioned in the following list:

*1 the Master: cross and orb 
*2 Saint Peter: a sword or a key, sometimes a fish
*3 Saint Andrew: a cross
*4 Saint James the Greater: a pilgrim's staff
*5 St. John: the cup of sorrow
*6 Saint Philip: a staff
*7 Saint Bartholomew: a knife
*8 Saint Thomas: a spar
*9 Saint Matthew: an axe or halbert
*10 Saint James the Lesser: a fuller's bat
*11 Saint Jude: a carpenter's set square
*12 Saint Simon Zealotes: a long saw
*13 Judas Iscariot: a bag of money

Passage:
Doi Inthanon
Doi Inthanon ( ([http://www.forvo.com/word/doi_inthanon/ pronunciation])) is the highest mountain in Thailand.  It is in Chom Thong District, Chiang Mai Province. This mountain is an ultra prominent peak, known in the past as Doi Luang (meaning ""big mountain"") or Doi Ang Ka, meaning the ""crow's pond top"". Near the mountain's base was a pond where many crows gathered. The name Doi Inthanon was given in honour of King Inthawichayanon, one of the last kings of Chiang Mai, who was concerned about the forests in the north and tried to preserve them. He ordered that after his death his remains be interred at Doi Luang, which was then renamed in his honour.

Today, the summit of Doi Inthanon is a popular tourist destination for both foreign and Thai tourists, with a peak of 12,000 visitors visiting the summit on New Year's Day. In addition to a range of tourist facilities on the summit, there is also a Royal Thai Air Force weather radar station at the summit and the Thai National Observatory (TNO) at km44. 

Geography

Doi Inthanon is the highest peak of the Inthanon Range () of the Thanon Thong Chai Range, a subrange of the Shan Hills in the Thai highlands stretching southwards from the Daen Lao Range. This range, the southwesternmost of the Shan Highland system, separates the Salween watershed from the Mekong watershed. Other high peaks of the Loi Lar Mountain Range are Doi Luang Chiang Dao (2,175 m), Doi Pui (1,685 m), and Doi Suthep (1,601 m).

In 1954, the forests around Doi Inthanon were conserved, creating Doi Inthanon National Park, as one of the original 14 national parks of Thailand.  This park now covers 482.4 km² and spreads from the lowlands at 800 m elevation up to the peak at 2,565 m. Given the varied climatic and ecological areas regions, the park supports a range of animal species, including over 360 bird species.

On the lower slopes of Doi Inthanon, near the Karen hill tribe village, Ban Sop Had, are the Wachirathan waterfalls (), where the Wachirathan (lit. ""Diamond Creek"") tumbles over a granite escarpment.

Climate 

The climate is typically tropical and fairly cool on the summit of Doi Inthanon. In winter the average temperature is 6 °C (43 °F) in January and temperatures can sometimes drop below 0 °C (32 °F). From March to June, temperatures are pleasant especially at higher altitudes. The rainy season runs from April to November, sometimes it rains often more than 2 hours per day.

The two chedis

On the main road to the summit of Doi Inthanon stand two adjacent chedis, one called Naphamethinidon (นภเมทินีดล), meaning ""by the strength of the land and air"", and the other, Naphaphonphumisiri (นภพลภูมิสิริ), meaning ""being the strength of the air and the grace of the land"". These temples were built to honour the 60th birthday anniversary of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 1987, and the 60th birthday anniversary of Queen Sirikit in 1992, respectively.

Geology

Geologically the mountain is a granite batholith in a north-south oriented mountain range. The second-highest peak of this range is Doi Hua Mot Luang at 2,340 m.

Heptathlon
A heptathlon is a track and field combined events contest made up of seven events. The name derives from the Greek hepta (seven) and athlon (contest). A competitor in a heptathlon is referred to as a heptathlete.

There are two heptathlons – the women's heptathlon and the men's – composed of different events. The men's heptathlon is older and is held indoors, while the women's is held outdoors and was introduced in the 1980s, first appearing in the Olympics in 1984.

Women's heptathlon

Women's heptathlon is the combined event for women contested in the Athletics program of the Olympics and in the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The IAAF World Combined Events Challenge determines a yearly women's heptathlon champion. The women's outdoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and the remaining three on day two:

* 100 metres hurdles
* High jump
* Shot put
* 200 metres
* Long jump
* Javelin throw 
* 800 metres

The heptathlon has been contested by female athletes since the early 1980s, when it replaced the pentathlon as the primary women's combined event contest (the javelin throw and 800 m were added).  It was first contested at the Olympic level in the 1984 Summer Olympics. In recent years some women's decathlon competitions have been conducted, consisting of the same events as the men's competition in a slightly different order, and the IAAF has begun keeping records for it, but the heptathlon remains the championship-level combined event for women. Jessica Ennis-Hill, representing Great Britain, is the 2012 Olympic Gold Medallist and the current World Champion.

There is also a Tetradecathlon, which is a double heptathlon, consisting of 14 events, seven events per day.

Points system

The heptathlon scoring system was devised by Dr Karl Ulbrich, a Viennese mathematician. The formulae are constructed so that, for each event, a designated ""standard"" performance (for example, approximately 1.82 m for the high jump) scores 1000 points.  Each event also has a minimum recordable performance level (e.g. 0.75 m for the high jump), corresponding to zero points. The formulae are devised so that successive constant increments in performance correspond to gradually increasing increments in points awarded.

The events are split into three groups, and the scores are calculated according to the three formulae: 

Running events (200 m, 800 m and 100 m hurdles):
:P = a \cdot (b - T)^c
Jumping events (high jump and long jump):
:P = a \cdot (M - b)^c
Throwing events (shot put and javelin):
:P = a \cdot (D - b)^c

P is for points, T is for time in seconds, M is for height or length in centimeters and D is length in meters. a, b and c have different values for each of the events (see table).

Benchmarks

The following table shows the benchmark levels required to earn 1000 points in each event of the heptathlon:

Women's world records compared to heptathlon bests

Men's heptathlon

 

The other version is an indoor competition, normally contested by men only. It is the men's combined event in the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics. The men's indoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and remaining three on day two:

* 60 metres
* long jump
* shot put
* high jump
* 60 metres hurdles
* pole vault
* 1000 metres

The scoring is similar for both versions. In each event, the athlete scores points for his/her performance in each event according to scoring tables issued by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).  The athlete accumulating the highest number of points wins the competition.

Pipe Smoker of the Year
Pipe Smoker of the Year was an award given out annually by the British Pipesmokers' Council, to honour a famous pipe-smoking individual. Initiated in 1965 as Pipeman of the Year by the Briar Pipe Trade Association, it was presented at a lunch in London's Savoy Hotel each January. The award was discontinued in 2004 because its organisers feared it fell foul of laws banning all advertising and promotion of tobacco. 
The award was reintroduced in 2014, by the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs, at the British Pipe Smoking Championship at Newark Showground. In a departure from previous awards the recipient was not a celebrity, but the outgoing President of the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs Brian Mills, in recognition for his personal contribution in recommencing the British Pipe Smoking Championships.

Passage:
Khartoum Resolution
The Khartoum Resolution of September 1, 1967 was issued at the conclusion of 1967 Arab League summit convened in the wake of the Six-Day War, in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. The summit lasted from August 29  to September 1 and was attended by eight Arab heads of state: Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, and Sudan.  The resolution called for: a continued state of belligerency with Israel, ending the Arab oil boycott declared during the Six-Day War, an end to the North Yemen Civil War, and economic assistance for Egypt and Jordan. It is famous for containing (in the third paragraph) what became known as the ""Three No's"": ""no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it..."" 

Text of the resolution 

#The conference has affirmed the unity of Arab states, the unity of joint action and the need for coordination and for the elimination of all differences. The Kings, Presidents and representatives of the other Arab Heads of State at the conference have affirmed their countries' stand by an implementation of the Arab Solidarity Charter which was signed at the third Arab summit conference in Casablanca.
#The conference has agreed on the need to consolidate all efforts to eliminate the effects of the aggression on the basis that the occupied lands are Arab lands and that the burden of regaining these lands falls on all the Arab States.
#The Arab Heads of State have agreed to unite their political efforts at the international and diplomatic level to eliminate the effects of the aggression and to ensure the withdrawal of the aggressive Israeli forces from the Arab lands which have been occupied since the aggression of June 5. This will be done within the framework of the main principles by which the Arab States abide, namely, no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it, and insistence on the rights of the Palestinian people in their own country.
#The conference of Arab Ministers of Finance, Economy and Oil recommended that suspension of oil pumping be used as a weapon in the battle. However, after thoroughly studying the matter, the summit conference has come to the conclusion that the oil pumping can itself be used as a positive weapon, since oil is an Arab resource which can be used to strengthen the economy of the Arab States directly affected by the aggression, so that these States will be able to stand firm in the battle. The conference has, therefore, decided to resume the pumping of oil, since oil is a positive Arab resource that can be used in the service of Arab goals. It can contribute to the efforts to enable those Arab States which were exposed to the aggression and thereby lost economic resources to stand firm and eliminate the effects of the aggression. The oil-producing States have, in fact, participated in the efforts to enable the States affected by the aggression to stand firm in the face of any economic pressure.
#The participants in the conference have approved the plan proposed by Kuwait to set up an Arab Economic and Social Development Fund on the basis of the recommendation of the Baghdad conference of Arab Ministers of Finance, Economy and Oil.
#The participants have agreed on the need to adopt the necessary measures to strengthen military preparation to face all eventualities.
#The conference has decided to expedite the elimination of foreign bases in the Arab States.

Interpretations

Commentators have frequently presented the resolution as an example of Arab rejectionism. Efraim Halevy, Guy Ben-Porat, Steven R. David, Julius Stone, and Ian Bremmer all agree the Khartoum Resolution amounted to a rejection of Israel's right to exist.      The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) itself enlisted the Khartoum Resolution to advocate against acceptance of Israel's right to exist as articulated in United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. 
Benny Morris wrote that the Arab leaders ""hammered out a defiant, rejectionist platform that was to bedevil all peace moves in the region for a decade"". He laid some of the blame with Israel, saying, ""[i]n part [the Arab] stand was a response to Israel's unwillingness or inability to consider withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza as part of any peace settlement"".  Odd Bull of the UNTSO opined in much the same manner in 1976. 

Avi Shlaim has argued that Arab spokesmen interpreted the Khartoum declarations to mean ""no formal peace treaty, but not a rejection of peace; no direct negotiations, but not a refusal to talk through third parties; and no de jure recognition of Israel, but acceptance of its existence as a state"" (emphasis in original). Shlaim states that the conference marked a turning point in Arab-Israeli relations, noting that Nasser urged Hussein to seek a ""comprehensive settlement"" with Israel. Shlaim acknowledges that none of this was known in Israel at the time, whose leaders took the ""three no's"" at face value. 

In the event, indirect negotiations between Israel, Jordan and Egypt eventually opened through the auspices of the Jarring Mission (1967-1973), and secret direct talks also took place between Israel and Jordan, but neither avenue succeeded in achieving a meaningful settlement, setting the stage for a new round of conflict.

Eva Stuart
Brian George Wilde (13 June 1927 – 20 March 2008) was an English actor , best known for his roles in television comedy , including Mr Barrowclough in Porridge and ""Foggy"" Dewhurst in Last of the Summer Wine . His lugubrious world-weary face was a staple of British television for forty years.

Career
Whilst born in Ashton-under-Lyne , Lancashire [1] , he was brought up in Devon and Hertfordshire and attended Richard Hale School . He trained as an actor at RADA . [1]
He had a small part in the horror film Night of the Demon (1957) and early television roles included the series The Love of Mike (1960) and supporting Tony Hancock in episodes of his ATV series in 1963. He also played Detective Superintendent Halcro in a series of two-part thrillers about undercover Scotland Yard officers, The Men from Room Thirteen (BBC, 1959-61). He had minor roles in films such as Life for Ruth (1962), The Bargee (1964), The Jokers (1967) and Carry On Doctor (1968), and on television in Room at the Bottom (1966-67) as Mr Salisbury. His first major television success was in 1970 as refuse depot manager ""Bloody Delilah"" in the ITV sitcom The Dustbinmen . He showed his sinister side as the mischievous magician Mr Peacock in the children's drama series Ace of Wands between 1970 & 1972. In 1971, he starred as a murderer in The Uninvited, an episode of the BBC's supernatural thriller series Out of the Unknown . Also in 1971, in the television drama Elizabeth R , Wilde played the efficient, merciless 'rackmaster' Richard Topcliffe, who was charged with the torture of prisoners in the Tower of London .

Porridge
Brian Wilde as prison warder Mr. Barraclough
In 1973, he starred as a different kind of gaoler in the second episode of Seven of One , a series of seven individual stories, all of which starred Ronnie Barker . In the episode, entitled ""Prisoner and Escort"", Wilde played Mr Barrowclough , a prison officer whose job it is to escort Barker's character Fletch across the moors to his prison. The episode proved popular and a series was commissioned by the BBC , called Porridge . Wilde reprised his role as the timid and eager-to-please Barraclough. Porridge was popular and successful; it ran until 1977, with a film version being made in 1979.
Last of the Summer Wine
Wilde established another famous role in 1976, when he took over from Michael Bates as the third member of a trio of old men in the BBC sitcom Last of the Summer Wine . The character, Walter ""Foggy"" Dewhurst, was a determined ex-army man who planned the group's misadventures with military precision and a painstaking eye for detail. Wilde saw the long-running series gather momentum and continue its success. He stayed with the series for 9 years before leaving in 1985, to work on other projects. Foggy was written out of the series - it was said that he had moved to Bridlington to take over the family egg painting business - and was replaced by Michael Aldridge as Seymour Utterthwaite until 1990.
When Aldridge left Last of the Summer Wine, Wilde returned as Foggy in 1990, reuniting the series' most popular and enduring line-up. Suffering from a mild infection, Wilde stood down for the first five episodes of the 1997 series in case his illness worsened. His temporary absence was covered by Frank Thornton ; Wilde himself suggested Thornton as a replacement. The filming of a Christmas Special made to introduce Thornton's character resulted in a scheduling problem that made it impossible for Wilde, who was by then fully fit, to return in that series. Producer Alan J.W. Bell said, ""Since then, he has been invited to return many times, but says he feels he has 'done it now' and doesn't want to go back. I am sure that one day he will make an appearance - we still have his costume standing by,"" but Wilde never did return to the role.
Other works
In 1967 the BBC TV series The Avengers episode ""The Fear Merchants"" original air date (UK) 21 January 1967. He played Jeremy Raven a ceramics manufacturer caught up in a sinister plot to get rid of the competition. In 1988 he starred in his own BBC series, Wyatt's Watchdogs as Major Wyatt, a retired soldier, who forms his own neighbourhood watch group. As a stuffy ex-army member who leads a motley bunch of comic characters, Wyatt was quite similar to Foggy. The programme, which co-starred Trevor Bannister , was written by Miles Tredinnick and ran for one series of six episodes.
Death
Wilde suffered a fall in January 2008 from which he never recovered. He died in his sleep on the morning of 20 March 2008 at his home in Ware , Hertfordshire . [2] [3]
Tribute
In May 2009 it was announced by Danbury Mint that themselves and the BBC had agreed with the sculptor Gordon Brown that as a tribute to Brian Wilde and his Last of the Summer Wine character Foggy Dewhurst that a figurine of ""Foggy"" was to be produced and to be released in July 2009 and will join the ""Last of the Summer Wine Collection"" of 9 other figurines which include Compo, Clegg, Truly, Nora Batty, Howard, Marina, Pearl, Wally Batty and Auntie Wainwright.

Passage:
Kupffer cell
Kupffer cells, also  known as stellate macrophages and Kupffer-Browicz cells, are specialized macrophages located in the liver, lining the walls of the sinusoids that form part of the mononuclear phagocyte system.

History

The cells were first observed by Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer in 1876.  The scientist called them ""Sternzellen"" (star cells or hepatic stellate cell) but thought, inaccurately, that they were an integral part of the endothelium of the liver blood vessels and that they originated from it. In 1898, after several years of research, Tadeusz Browicz identified them, correctly, as macrophages.  

Development

Their development begins in the yolk sac where they differentiate into fetal macrophages. Once they enter the blood stream, they migrate to the fetal liver where they reside. There they complete their differentiation into Kupffer cells.

Function

Red blood cells are broken down by phagocytic action, where the hemoglobin molecule is split.  The globin chains are re-utilized, while the iron-containing portion, heme, is further broken down into iron, which is re-utilized, and bilirubin, which is conjugated to glucuronic acid within hepatocytes and secreted into the bile.

Helmy et al. identified a receptor present in Kupffer cells, the complement receptor of the immunoglobulin family (CRIg). Mice without CRIg could not clear complement system-coated pathogens. CRIg is conserved in mice and humans and is a critical component of the innate immune system. 

Function in alcoholic liver disease

Kupffer cell activation is responsible for early ethanol-induced liver injury, common in chronic alcoholics.  Chronic alcoholism and liver injury deal with a two hit system.  The second hit is characterized by an activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and CD14, receptors on the Kupffer cell that internalize endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide or LPS).  This activates the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tumor necrosis factor-alpha or TNFα) and production of superoxides (a pro-oxidant).  TNFα will then enter the stellate cell in the liver, leading to collagen synthesis and fibrosis.  Fibrosis will eventually cause cirrhosis, or loss of function of the liver.
Question:
Where in the body are the Kupffer Cells found?
Answer:
Impressio duodenalis
Passage:
Dunnock
The dunnock (Prunella modularis) is a small passerine, or perching bird, found throughout temperate Europe and into Asia. Dunnocks have also been successfully introduced into New Zealand. It is by far the most widespread member of the accentor family, which otherwise consists of mountain species. Other common names of the dunnock include the hedge accentor, hedge sparrow, or hedge warbler. The name ""dunnock"" comes from the Ancient British *dunnākos, meaning ""little brown one.""  However, common or garden English dun (dingy brown, dark-colored) and the diminutive ock would also produce dunnock. Cf. pillock.

Description

A European robin-sized bird, the dunnock typically measures 13.5–14 cm in length. It possesses a streaked back, somewhat resembling a small house sparrow. Like that species, the dunnock has a drab appearance in order to avoid predation. It is brownish underneath, and has a fine pointed bill. Adults have a grey head, and both sexes are similarly coloured.

Distribution and habitat

Dunnocks reside in the more mild western and southern parts of the globe, inhabiting much of Europe including Lebanon, northern Iran, and the Caucasus. Dunnocks were successfully introduced into New Zealand during the 19th century, and are now widely distributed around the country and some offshore islands.   Favourite habitats include woodlands, shrubs, gardens, and hedgerows.

Territoriality

 

The main call of the dunnock is a shrill, persistent tseep along with a high trilling note, which betrays the bird's otherwise inconspicuous presence. The song is rapid, thin and tinkling, a sweet warble which can be confused with that of the Eurasian wren, but is shorter and weaker.

Dunnocks are territorial and may engage in conflict with other birds that encroach upon their nests. Males sometimes share a territory and exhibit a strict dominance hierarchy. Nevertheless, this social dominance is not translated into benefits to the alpha male in terms of reproduction, since parternity is usually equally shared between males of the group.   Furthermore, members of a group are rarely related, and so competition can result. 

Female territorial ranges are almost always exclusive. However, sometimes, multiple males will cooperate to defend a single territory containing multiple females. Males exhibit a strong dominance hierarchy within groups: older birds tend to be the alpha males and first-year birds are usually the betas. Studies have found that close male relatives almost never share a territory.

The male’s ability to access females generally depends on female range size, which is affected by the distribution of food. When resources are distributed in dense patches, female ranges tend to be small and easy for males to monopolize. Subsequent mating systems, as discussed below, reflect high reproductive success for males and relatively lower success for females. In times of scarcity, female territories expand to accommodate the lack of resources, causing males to have a more difficult time monopolizing females. Hence, females gain a reproductive advantage over males in this case. 

Breeding

Mating systems

The dunnock possesses variable mating systems. Females are often polyandrous, breeding with two or more males at once,   which is quite rare among birds. This multiple mating system leads to the development of sperm competition amongst the male suitors. DNA fingerprinting has shown that chicks within a brood often have different fathers, depending on the success of the males at monopolising the female.  Males try to ensure their paternity by pecking at the cloaca of the female to stimulate ejection of rival males' sperm.  Dunnocks take just one-tenth of a second to copulate and can mate more than 100 times a day.  Males provide parental care in proportion to their mating success, so two males and a female can commonly be seen provisioning nestlings at one nest.

Other mating systems also exist within dunnock populations, depending on the ratio of male to females and the overlap of territories. When only one female and one male territory overlap, monogamy is preferred. Sometimes, two or three adjacent female territories overlap one male territory, and so polygyny is favored, with the male monopolising several females.  Polygynandry also exists, in which two males jointly defend a territory containing several females.  Polyandry, though, is the most common mating system of dunnocks found in nature.  Depending on the population, males generally have the best reproductive success in polygynous populations, while females have the advantage during polyandry.

Studies have illustrated the fluidity of dunnock mating systems. When given food in abundance, female territory size is reduced drastically. Consequently, males can more easily monopolise the females. Thus, the mating system can be shifted from one that favours female success (polyandry), to one that promotes male success (monogamy, polygynandry, or polygyny). 

Nest

The dunnock builds a neat nest (predominantly from twigs and moss and lined with soft materials such as wool or feathers), low in a bush or conifer, where adults typically lay three to five unspotted blue eggs.

Parental care and provisioning

Broods, depending on the population, can be raised by a lone female, multiple females with the part-time help of a male, multiple females with full-time help by a male, or by multiple females and multiple males. In pairs, the male and the female invest parental care at similar rates. However, in trios, the female and alpha male invest more care in chicks than does the beta male. In territories in which females are able to escape from males, both the alpha and beta males share provisioning equally. This last system represents the best case scenario for females, as it helps to ensure maximal care and the success of the young.

A study has found that males tend to not discriminate between their own young and those of another male in polyandrous or polygynandrous systems. However, they do vary their feeding depending on the certainty of paternity. If a male has greater access to a female, and therefore a higher chance of a successful fertilisation, during a specific mating period, it would provide more care towards the young.
Question:
What is the 'Dunnock' more commonly known as?
Answer:
Hedge accentor
Passage:
President of the Confederate States of America
The President of the Confederate States of America was the elected head of state and government of the Confederate States. The president also headed the executive branch of government and was commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into Confederate service. 

Article II of the Confederate States Constitution vested the executive power of the Confederacy in the president. The power included the execution of law, alongside the responsibility of appointing executive, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the senate. He was further empowered to grant reprieves and pardons, and convene and adjourn either or both houses of congress under extraordinary circumstances.

The president was indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a six-year term, and was one of only two nationally elected Confederate officers, the other being the Vice President of the Confederate States. On February 18, 1861, Jefferson Davis became president of the provisional government. On February 22, 1862, he was elected president of the permanent government and served in that capacity until being captured by elements of the United States Cavalry in 1865. 

Powers and duties

The constitutional powers of the President of the Confederate States of America were quite similar to those of the President of the United States of America. The permanent Confederate States Constitution made him commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into service of the Confederate States. He was also empowered to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the Confederate States. He was authorized to make treaties; to nominate and appoint diplomatic representatives, judges, and other officers of the Confederate States (including the heads of the executive departments) by and with the consent of the Confederate States Senate; and to remove such representatives and officers. He could fill vacancies during a recess of the Senate, but he could not reappoint, during a recess, persons previously rejected by it. He was to supply Congress with information, recommend legislation, receive ambassadors and other public ministers, see that the federal laws were faithfully executed, and commission all officers of the military and naval forces of the Confederate States.

Election and oath

On February 9, 1861, the provisional congress at Montgomery elected Jefferson Davis president and Alexander H. Stephens vice president. Stephens, who was a delegate to Congress from Georgia, was inaugurated on February 11. Davis was inaugurated on February 18 upon his arrival from Mississippi, where he had gone upon his resignation from the U.S. Senate. Davis and Stephens were elected on November 6, 1861, for six-years terms, as provided by the permanent constitution. The Capital had been moved in June 1861, to Richmond, and the inauguration took place at the statue of Washington, on the public square, on February 22, 1862.

Before Davis entered on the execution of his office as President of the Confederate States, he was constitutionally required to take the following oath or affirmation:

Compensation

In 1861, the President of the Confederate States earned a $25,000 annual salary, along with an expense account, and a nontaxable travel account.  The President's Office was located on the second floor of the Custom House on Main Street, a structure which also housed the Cabinet Room and the State and Treasury Department. The City of Richmond purchased the Brockenbrough house for presentation to the Confederate government for use as an executive mansion. Davis declined to accept the gift, but the mansion was leased for his use. Referred to as the ""White House of the Confederacy"" or the ""Grey House,"" the mansion was used by President Davis throughout the existence of his presidency. Later it became a repository for documents, relics, and pictures, and in 1896 it was redesignated the Confederate Museum.

Post-presidency

Late on the evening of April 2, 1865, President Davis, his aides, and members of the Cabinet, except Secretary of War Breckinridge, departed from Richmond on the Richmond and Danville Railroad. The Cabinet stayed at Danville, 140 mi miles southwest of Richmond, until April 10, when, hearing of Lee's surrender, it continued farther south. At Greensboro, North Carolina, on April 12 the Cabinet met with Generals Johnston and Beauregard and discussed surrender of Johnston's army to General Sherman. As the railroad south of Greensboro had been destroyed, the flight from that location was on horseback and in ambulances, wagons, and carriages. The last Cabinet meetings took place at Charlotte, on April 24, and 26, and on May 4; when Davis left Washington, Georgia, the party consisted only of his aides and Postmaster General Reagan. Elements of the United States Cavalry captured Davis and his companions at an encampment near Irwinville, May 10, 1865.

Jefferson Davis was imprisoned at Fort Monroe, Virginia, until his release on bail on May 13, 1867. During his confinement the United States Government prepared to bring him to trial for treason and for complicity in the assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln. He could not be tried in Virginia until the Federal court was reestablished there, but by the time the circuit judges were prepared in May 1867 the United States Government decided the outcome of a trial before a local jury was far too uncertain and dropped the proceedings. In November 1868 Davis was brought to trial under a new indictment, but the judges disagreed and the case was referred to the Supreme Court. President Johnson issued a general amnesty in December 1868, and the Supreme Court entered a nolle prosequi, thus freeing Davis.

Image caption Rebecca Adlington (l) won Team GB's second medal on Sunday, while some events still had empty seats and others were disrupted by rain
Team GB has won its first London 2012 medals, with cyclist Lizzie Armitstead taking silver in the women's road race.
Swimmer Rebecca Adlington has taken bronze in the final of the 400m freestyle.
London 2012 chairman Lord Coe insisted Olympics venues were ""stuffed"" with sports fans, after a row about empty seats on Saturday.
However, on Sunday empty seats could be seen at several sports, including basketball, volleyball and tennis.
Armitstead, 23, from Otley near Leeds, was beaten to the gold at the end of the 140-kilometre race by Holland's Marianne Vos in a sprint finish on The Mall.
She said: ""I'm really, really happy. Maybe later I'll start thinking about that gold, but I'm happy with silver at the moment.""
Adlington, 23, who lost her title to Camille Muffat of France, said she was glad she had won a medal at a home games.
""The crowd were just absolutely amazing, this is what I wanted, this is what picks you up, this is what gets you from fourth to third and gets us on that podium. I know so many people wanted me to get the gold and sorry about that, but I tried my absolute hardest, I'm so pleased with that.""
She later tweeted: : ""Ahhhhhhhh bronze medal!!! Can't believe it! SOOO happy its unreal! The crowd was incredible! THANK YOU to everyone, your support is amazing!""
Adlington's battle to hold on to her 800m freestyle title will begin with heats on Thursday morning before Friday night's final.
In other Olympic developments:
Police say 16 people have been arrested over ticket touting at the Olympics during the past two days
Three people have been charged after 182 were held following a Critical Mass cycle ride near the Olympic Park on Friday
Lord Coe spoke out as the row mounted over unfilled seats in several Olympic venues.
At some venues, seats in the accredited ""Olympic family"" areas - reserved for groups including officials, sports federations, athletes, journalists and sponsors - have remained empty.
Media captionSebastian Coe: ""I'm not sure that naming shaming is what we are into""
""I don't think you will be seeing this as an issue, long-term through the Games,"" he told a press conference.
Organisers Locog said it would fill some of the empty seats with servicemen and women, as well as local students and teachers.
It said it would also sell more tickets, after some 1,000 tickets were released on the London 2012 website on Saturday night.
A system has been introduced similar to the one used at Wimbledon, where people coming out of the stadium handed on their tickets so the seats could be made available to others.
A Locog spokesman added that it would examine options to upgrade the tickets of members of the public and move them into accredited areas.
Olympics coverage online
On Sunday, empty seats were seen at venues including basketball at the Olympic Park, where troops filled the gaps, tennis at Wimbledon and volleyball at Earl's Court.
Around 100 seats at the gymnastics at the North Greenwich Arena were also given to troops.
But many other venues were full, including boxing, judo and fencing at ExCel, badminton at Wembley Arena and shooting at the Royal Artillery Barracks.
American Paul Fondie, who now lives in Kew, west London, said he was frustrated by the number of empty seats at the men's gymnastics at the O2 on Saturday.
Image caption Lizzie Armitstead (r) won silver in the women's road race
He said he and his wife had not been able to take their six-year-old son because they could not get an extra ticket.
""It tainted my experience of the Olympics - it was our moment to come under the microscope and show that London can do it well.""
Andy Murray has claimed his first Olympic singles victory, beating Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka 6-3 6-3.
And Briton Ben Ainslie opened his quest for a fourth Olympic gold medal with a second place finish in the opening race in the sailing at Weymouth Bay.
British teams have been competing in basketball, handball, hockey, volleyball, water polo and the football on Sunday.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela | República Bolivariana de Venezuela
Country Profile
Background:
Venezuela was one of the three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran        Colombia in 1830 (the others being Colombia and Ecuador).
For most of the first half of the 20th century, Venezuela was ruled by generally        benevolent military strongmen, who promoted the oil industry and allowed for some        social reforms. Democratically elected governments have held sway since 1959.
Under Hugo CHAVEZ, president from 1999 to 2013, and his hand-picked successor, President Nicolas MADURO, the executive branch has exercised increasingly authoritarian control over other branches of government. At the same time, democratic institutions have deteriorated, threats to freedom of expression have increased, and political polarization has grown.
Current concerns include: an increasingly politicized military, rampant violent crime, high inflation, and widespread shortages of basic consumer goods, medicine, and medical supplies, overdependence on the petroleum industry with its price        fluctuations, and irresponsible mining operations that are endangering the rain        forest and indigenous peoples.
Venezuela assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2015-16 term.

Vesti la giubba
"""" (""Put on the costume"", sometimes translated as ""On With the Motley"") is a famous tenor aria from Ruggero Leoncavallo's 1892 opera Pagliacci. """" is sung at the conclusion of the first act, when Canio discovers his wife's infidelity, but must nevertheless prepare for his performance as Pagliaccio the clown because ""the show must go on"".

The aria is often regarded as one of the most moving in the operatic repertoire of the time. The pain of Canio is portrayed in the aria and exemplifies the entire notion of the ""tragic clown"": smiling on the outside but crying on the inside. This is still displayed today, as the clown motif often features the painted-on tear running down the cheek of the performer.

Enrico Caruso's recordings of the aria, from 1902, 1904 and 1909, were among the top selling records of the 78-rpm era..The New Guinness Book of Records, ed. Peter Matthews, Guinness Publishing. 1995. p.150 

This aria is often used in popular culture, and has been featured in many renditions, mentions, and spoofs.

Passage:
Battle of Bomarsund
The Battle of Bomarsund was fought by an Anglo-French task force against Russian defenses at Bomarsund during the Crimean War.

Background 

Bomarsund was a 19th-century fortress, the construction of which had started in 1832 by Russia in Sund, Åland Islands, in the Baltic Sea. Bomarsund had not been completed (only two towers of the planned twelve subsidiary towers had been completed). When the war broke out the fortress remained vulnerable especially against forces attacking over land. Designers of the fortress had also assumed that narrow sea passages near the fortress would not be passable for large naval ships; while this assumption had held true during the time of sailing ships, it was possible for steam powered ships to reach weakly defended sections of the fortress.

First battle 

On 21 June 1854, three British ships bombarded the Bomarsund fortress. Artillery from the shore, however, responded and, while both sides suffered some damage, the casualties were light. The first battle was indecisive. During the battle, Charles Davis Lucas tossed overboard a shell which had landed on board. The shell exploded before it reached water. For saving his ship he was the first man to be awarded the Victoria Cross. 

Second battle 

While the first battle had been a brief clash and artillery duel, the second battle was a different affair. By the end of July 1854, a British fleet of 25 ships had surrounded the fortress and only waited for the French ground troops to arrive. Both defender and attacker had acknowledged that the fort could not be defeated by naval forces alone and made preparations accordingly, Russian forces destroyed the surrounding countryside in an effort to force British and French forces break away from the assumed siege.

Landing on 8 August, the British troops established a battery of three 32-pounder guns on a hill, the French establishing several batteries. 
On 13 August 1854, the French artillery opened fire on a tower and by the end of the day were in a position that while artillery suppressed the defenders of subsidiary tower of Brännklint, French infantry assaulted it.  Defenders found their position to be hopeless and withdrew the bulk of their forces to the main fort leaving only small detachment behind to supervise demolition of the tower. While French troops managed to capture the tower before it was demolished, it did not save the tower since the Russian artillery now opened fire at the captured tower and on 15 August 1854 scored a hit to the gunpowder magazines. The resulting explosion demolished the tower.

The second tower, Notvik, was also lost on 15 August 1854 after British guns opened fire from their hill opposite to the tower. After eight hours of bombardment they managed to create a gaping hole to the fort. After most of the guns had been lost commandant of the tower surrendered to the British and French forces.

The bombardment of the main fortress started late on 15 August 1854 with land based guns and the navy opening fire. With only a few guns capable of firing in the direction of the bombarding ships, the Russian forces hoped for the French and British forces to attack over land. However, after the bombardment continued into the 16 August without any indication of landings, it became apparent to the Russian commander that British and French intended to reduce the fortress with artillery fire. As the situation appeared hopeless, Bomarsund surrendered on 16 August 1854.

The early surrender came as a surprise of the French and British. 2,000 men laid down their arms and became prisoners.

Aftermath 

After the surrender, French and British forces demolished the fortress. British engineers remained until mid-September to ensure it could not be easily rebuilt.

Three hundred Finnish grenadiers defending the fortress were captured and imprisoned in Lewes in the United Kingdom.  They were later allowed to return to Finland, and they returned with a song telling about their battles and imprisonment, called the War of Åland (""Finnish: Oolannin sota, Swedish: ""Det Åländska kriget). The Russian Memorial was erected in Lewes in 1877 to honour those who died in captivity.

In the Treaty of Paris 1856, the entire Åland Islands were demilitarized, which is a status that has been preserved until this day.

The Bomarsund Bridge connects Bomarsund to the Prästö island.

Victoria Cross recipients 

In addition to Charles Davis Lucas several other Victoria Crosses were awarded in the Baltic Theater during the Crimean War.

Other VC recipients for action in the Baltic Sea:
* John Bythesea - 1854; Åland Islands
* William Johnstone - 1854; Åland Islands
* George Ingouville - 1855; Fort of Viborg
* George Dare Dowell - 1855; Fort of Viborg

Trivia 

*A coal mine in Northumberland was named after the battle; the neighboring village still carries the name Bomarsund.
*In 2007 Orlando Gough's opera The Finnish Prisoner which tells about the events of 1854 had its premiere performance in Lewes.

It started in Leeds, United Kingdom, and concluded in Paris, France on 27 July. The winner was Italian cyclist Vincenzo Nibali, who won the race by more than seven minutes. All 18 teams in the Pro team category were obliged to enter the race, and were also invited to compete in the  Continental Pro Team category, which is open to teams from all over the world. The race was won by Italian cyclist Nibali by a margin of more than 7 minutes, and finished in Paris on July 27. The overall winner was French cyclist Thibaut Pinot, who finished in a time of 2:05:02. The Tour deFrance is traditionally followed through a clockwise route through a number of French cities, including Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Nice and Bordeaux, before returning to the UK for the end-of-season finale in Glasgow. The final stage of the Tour takes place on Sunday, July 28. The finish line will be held in Glasgow, Scotland, on the outskirts of the city on the island of Leicestershire, in the shadow of the River Thames. It will be the first time the Tour has been held in Scotland since it began in 1998. The event will be followed by a stage in the UK, with the final stage taking place in Glasgow on July 30. The first stage will take place in Scotland on July 31, and the second in the United Kingdom on July 28, before moving on to the Scottish mainland on July 29.

The sixth stage will conclude in Scotland and the seventh in the Netherlands on August 22. There are four main individual classifications contested in the 2014 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The general classification is calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The points classification awards a green jersey; cyclists get points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The mountains classification is a special points competition awarded to those riders who climb the most difficult ascents the fastest. There is a combativity award, given after each stage to the cyclist considered to be the most combative rider that day; it is awarded by a jury vote. The winner wears red numbers on the back of his jersey the following day. This was the fourth Tour to contain stages in the United Kingdom (after 1974, 1994 and 2007) and the first edition to contain more than two stages there. The ceremony included performances from Embrace and Opera North. The first three stages of the Tour were in the UK, starting in Leeds. The 2014 Tour will finish in Paris on June 14. The Tour deFrance is the most popular cycling event in the world, with more than 100,000 spectators attending each day of the race.

The 2013 Tour was the last to be staged in France, with stages in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There were also two special awards, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange given to first rider over the highest climb in the Tour and the Souensir Jacques Goddet, given to the first rider to pass his memorial. The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis is the head of London's Metropolitan Police Service. The post is currently held by Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe after his appointment by the Queen on 12 September 2011. The Commissioner's annual salary without pension contributions or allowances from 1 September 2010, is £260,088. The insignia of rank is a crown above a Bath Star, known as ""pips"", above crossed tipstaves within a wreath. The badge is all but unique within the British police, shared only with the Commissioner of the City of London Police, the smallest territorial police force, and HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary. Applicants to the post of Commissioner must be British citizens, and be ""serving UK chief constables or of equivalent UK ranks and above"" The Commissioner is ""accountable to the Home Secretary; to the MPA, chaired by the Mayor of London; and must answer to Londoners and the public nationally"" The requirement to be a British national has blocked the appointment of non-British Commissioners in the past. In August 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron wanted former Los Angeles Police Department Chief Bill Bratton to become the new Met Police Commissioner, but this was blocked by the Home Office pointing out that the Commissioner has to be British. The requirement is set to be scrapped by a proposal made by  Leeds, UK Mayor. de France begin?  Answer:   Leeds,. UK Mayor  de France proposes to scrap the requirement for a British Commissioner to be in place by the end of the next Parliament in May 2015. The title Commissioner was not used until 1839, and was first used by Sir John Nott-Bower, who served as Commissioner from 1953 to 1958, despite several previous Commissioners having served in senior administrative positions in colonial forces. Sir Joseph Simpson was the first Commissioner to have started his career as the lowest rank of Constable. However, Sir Robert Mark, appointed in 1972, is the first to have risen through all the ranks from the lowest to the highest, as all his successors have done. The Hay Wain is a painting by John Constable, finished in 1821. It depicts a rural scene on the River Stour between the English counties of Suffolk and Essex. Constable originally exhibited the finished work with the title Landscape: Noon. The painting caused a sensation when it was exhibited with other works by Constable at the 1824 Paris Salon. It was voted the second most popular painting in any British gallery, second only to Turner's Fighting Temeraire, in a 2005 poll organised by BBC Radio 4's Today programme. On 28 June 2013 a protester, reported to be connected with Fathers4Justice, glued a photograph of a young boy to the painting while it was on display at the National Gallery. The work was not permanently damaged and is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. It is one of a series of paintings by Constable called the ""six-footers"", large-scale canvasses which he painted for the annual summer exhibitions at the Royal Academy. As with all of the paintings in this series Constable produced a full-scale oil sketch for the work; this is now on display in the museum. It has been suggested that the inclusion of Constable's paintings in the exhibition was a tribute to Théodore Géricault, who died early that year. The other works in the show inspired a new generation of French painters, including Eugène Delacroix, who went on to become one of the most famous painters of the 20th century.

The list of Commissioners includes: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Chief Inspector of Constabulary. Apostle spoons were particularly popular in Pre-Reformation times when belief in the services of a patron saint was still strong. They symbolize the Last Supper of Christ in the company of the Apostles. They first appeared as a bequest in the will of one Amy Brent who, in 1516,  bequeathed ""XIII sylver spones of J' hu and the XII Apostells"" Shakespeare refers to it in Henry VIII, Act 5, Scene 3, where Cranmer declines to be sponsor for the infant Elizabeth because of his lack of money. The name Doi Inthanon was given in honour of King Inthawichayanon, one of the last kings of Chiang Mai, who was concerned about the forests in the north. He ordered that after his death his remains be interred at Doi Luang, which was then renamed in his honour. Today, the highest peak of the In Thanon Range, a subrange of the Thong Chai Range, is a popular tourist destination for both foreign and Thai tourists with 12,000 visitors on New Year's Day. In addition to a range of tourist facilities on the summit, there is also a Royal Thai Air Force weather radar and the National Observatory at the summit at TNO (TNO) at 44 km (T44.44 miles) from the summit of the mountain. The British Museum in London has a set from England dating from 1536–7 which has a figure of the Virgin Mary on the thirteenth spoon. By the sixteenth century they had become popular as baptismal presents for godchildren, but were dying out by the 1660s. Such examples would typically be in electroplated nickel silver and marked on the rear face with ""EPNS""  In this case the apostle is simply holding what appears to be a book. A complete sets of thirteen, with the figure of Jesus on a larger spoon, are still rarer. The spoon shown opposite is typical of single spoons not part of a set, and is called a 'Spoon of the Twelve Apostles' (SPNS) The spoons can be known by the attribute mentioned in the following list: the Master: cross and orb *2 Saint Peter: a sword or a key, sometimes a fish*3 Saint James the Greater: a pilgrim's staff*4 Saint Philip: a staff*5 St John: the cup of sorrow                *6 Saint Thomas: a knife*7 Saint Bartholomew: a spar*8 Saint Matthew: an axe or halbert*9 Saint Jude: a carpenter's set square*12 Saint Simon Zealotes: a long saw*13 Judas Iscariot: a bag of money Doi Inthanon National Park covers 482.4 km² and spreads from the lowlands at 800 m elevation up to the peak at 2,565 m. In winter the average temperature is 6 °C (43 °F) in January and temperatures can sometimes drop below 0 °C. The rainy season runs from April to November, sometimes it rains often more than 2 hours per day.

The heptathlon has been contested by female athletes since the early 1980s. It replaced the pentathlon as the primary women's combined event contest. Jessica Ennis-Hill, representing Great Britain, is the 2012 Olympic Gold Medallist and the current World Champion. There is also a Tetradecathlon, consisting of 14 events, seven events per day. Heptathlon scoring system was devised by Dr Karl Ulbrich, a Viennese mathematician. In each event, the athlete scores points for his/her performance in each event according to scoring tables issued by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The athlete accumulating the highest number of points wins the competition. The events are split into three groups, and the scores are calculated according to the three formulae:  P is for points, T is for time in seconds, M is for height or length in centimeters and D is length in meters. A, b and c have different values for each of the events (see table). The scoring is similar for both versions. The men's indoor heptathlete consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and remaining three on day two: 60 metres hurdles, 200m, 800m and 100m hurdles, long jump and javelin throw. The women's version is an indoor competition, normally contested by men only. It is the men's combinedevent in the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics. As of July 2016, the British Pipe Smoker's Smoker award was given out annually by the British Athletics Association. The award is given out in honour of the best British athlete of the Year in each year. The winner of the award is announced on the final day of the British Year of the Pipe Pipes competition, which takes place on the last Saturday of the month of July. The prize is an award of £1,000 (£1,500 in the U.S. and £2,000 in the UK). The award has been given out for the last three years, starting with the 2011 British Open Championships in London, and ending with the 2012 British Open World Championships in Glasgow, which took place on July 28, 2012. The awards are given out by the American Athletics Association (AAA) and the British Track and Field Federation (BOTF). The BOTF award is also given out each year to the British athlete who wins the British Open 100m and 200m titles in the same year, as well as the British World Championship gold medal. The Khartoum Resolution of September 1, 1967 was issued at the conclusion of the 1967 Arab League summit convened in the wake of the Six-Day War. It is famous for containing what became known as the ""Three No's"": ""no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel and no negotiations with it..."" The award was discontinued in 2004 because its organisers feared it fell foul of laws banning all advertising and promotion of tobacco. It was reintroduced in 2014, by the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs, at the British Pipe Smoking Championship at Newark Showground. In a departure from previous awards the recipient was not a celebrity, but the outgoing President of the UK federation Brian Mills, in recognition for his personal contribution in recommencing the British pipe Smoking Championships. The winner of the Pipeman of the Decade award in 1976 was Harold Wilson, who was named Pipe Smoker of the Year for the 1976/7 season. The award for the best pipe-smoking individual in the UK was given to Peter Cushing, who won the award in 1969. The recipient of the Pipe Smokers of the year award in 1964 was Rupert Davies, who received the award for his outstanding work in the field of pipe smoking. He was awarded the award by the Briar Pipe Trade Association, which was founded in 1965, and was presented at a lunch in London’s Savoy Hotel each January. The next year it was awarded to Lord Shinwell, who went on to win the award the following year. The following year it went to Lord McBride, who had won it in the previous two years. It has also been awarded to Sir Ian Botham, Sir Brian Barnes, Sir Ian Bostick, Sir Richard Dunhill, Sir Andrew Cushing and Sir Ian McBride. The list of winners continues to grow, with the most recent coming in the 2010/11 season, when it was handed out by the Pipe Smoking Association. The winners were: Joss Ackland, Jethro Bradbury, Richard Dunhill and Willie John McBride (all of whom won the 1976 award for best pipe smoking). The award has been given to the winner of each of the last two years’ awards for the ‘Pipe Smokers’ award, which has been handed out every year since the start of the competition. that the oil pumping can itself be used as a positive weapon, since oil is an Arab resource which can be used to strengthen the economy of the Arab States directly affected by the aggression. The conference has, therefore, decided to resume the pumping of oil. The participants in the conference have approved the plan proposed by Kuwait to set up an Arab Economic and Social Development Fund on the basis of the recommendation of the Baghdad conference of Arab Ministers of Finance, Economy and Oil. They have agreed on the need to adopt the necessary measures to strengthen military preparation to face all eventualities. The Conference has decided to expedite the elimination of foreign bases in the Arab states. The Khartoum Resolution of 1967 that was organized after the Six-Day War became famous for its """"Three No's"""" rejecting what entity? The resolution was a response to Israel's unwillingness or inability to consider withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza as part of any peace settlement. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) enlisted the resolution to advocate against acceptance of Israel's right to exist as articulated in United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. The resolution marked a turning point in Arab-Israeli relations, noting that Nasser urged Hussein to seek a ""comprehensive settlement"" with Israel. The Arab leaders interpreted the ""three no's"" to mean ""no formal peace treaty, but not a rejection of peace""; no direct negotiations, but no refusal to talk through third parties; and no de jure recognition of Israel, but acceptance of its existence as a state. In the event, indirect negotiations between Israel, Jordan and Egypt eventually opened through the auspices of the Jarring Mission (1967-1973), and secret direct talks also took place between Israel and Jordan. Neither avenue succeeded in achieving a meaningful settlement, setting the stage for a new round of conflict. See more info or our list of citable articles.

The Full Wiki is a free encyclopedia that includes articles from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, and other sources. Brian Wilde was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire. He trained as an actor at RADA. His first major television success was in 1970 as refuse depot manager ""Bloody Delilah"" in the ITV sitcom The Dustbinmen. He showed his sinister side as the mischievous magician Mr Peacock in the children's drama series Ace of Wands between 1970 & 1972. In 1973, he starred as a different kind of gaoler in the second episode of Seven of One, a series of seven individual stories, all of which starred Ronnie Barker. In 1976, he took over from Michael Bates as the third member of a trio of old men in the BBC sitcom Last of the Summer Wine. He was replaced by Michael Aldridge as Seymour Utterthwaite until 1990. In 1988 he starred in his own BBC series, Major Wyatt, as a retired soldier who leads a motley group of ex-army members. He stood down for the first five episodes of the 1997 series in case his illness worsened. His temporary absence was covered by Frank Thornton ; Wilde himself suggested Thornton as a replacement. He stayed with the series for 9 years before leaving in 1985, to work on other projects. Wilde saw the long-running series gather momentum and continue its success. He has been invited to return many times, but says he feels he has 'done it now' and doesn't want to go back. He played Jeremy Raven a ceramics manufacturer caught up in a sinister plot to get rid of the watchdogs in Watchdogs, a BBC series from 1988-1989. He also played Detective Superintendent Halcro in a two-part thrillers about undercover Scotland Yard officers, The Men from Room Thirteen (BBC, 1959-61). He had minor roles in films such as Life for Ruth (1962), The Bargee (1964), The Jokers (1967) and Carry On Doctor (1968) and on television in Room at the Bottom (1966-67) as Mr Salisbury. He starred as Major Wyatt in Watchdog, the BBC series about a retired watchdog who leads his own group of motley co-armies. He died in a car crash in 2005, aged 83. He is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son. Wilde suffered a fall in January 2008 from which he never recovered. He died in his sleep on the morning of 20 March 2008 at his home in Ware, Hertfordshire. A figurine of ""Foggy"" was to be produced and to be released in July 2009 and will join the ""Last of the Summer Wine Collection"" of 9 other figurines which include Compo, Clegg, Truly, Nora Batty, Howard, Marina, Pearl, Wally Batty and Auntie Wainwright. Kupffer cells are specialized macrophages located in the liver, lining the walls of the sinusoids that form part of the mononuclear phagocyte system. The name ""dunnock"" comes from the Ancient British *dunnāk, meaning ""little brown"" or ""little garden"" The dunnock (Prunella modularis) is a small passerine, or perching bird, found throughout temperate Europe and into Asia. It is the most widespread member of the accentor family, which consists of the dunnocks, hedge sparrows and mountain mountain species. It possesses a streaked back, someway-colored back, and is typically 13–14 cm in length. It would also produce an ocky brown, dark-colored and the diminutive ockiness of a robin-sized bird, the robin or robin of paradise. The bird is also known as the European robin and is found in Europe and North America. It can also be found in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. It's a small bird, perching on a tree or a tree branch. It has a short, streaked, dark brown back, with a dark brown and light-coloured back. It measures about 13.5–14 cm in length and is commonly found in the south of England and the north of Scotland. It also has a light brown and dark brown undersides, and can be seen from a distance of up to 100 yards. It was first observed by Karl Wilhelm von K upffer in 1876. In 1898, after several years of research, Tadeusz Browicz identified them, correctly, as macrophage. The cells are responsible for early ethanol-induced liver injury, common in chronic alcoholics. The second hit is characterized by an activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and CD14. This activates the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and production of superoxides (a pro-oxidant) The dunnock has a drab appearance in order to avoid predation. It is brownish underneath, and has a fine pointed bill. Adults have a grey head, and both sexes are similarly coloured. Dunnocks are territorial and may engage in conflict with other birds that encroach upon their nests. Females are often polyandrous, breeding with two or more males at once. Males provide parental care in proportion to their mating success, so two males and a female can commonly be seen provisioning nestlings at one nest. The male’s ability to access females generally depends on female range size, which is affected by the distribution of food. When given food in abundance, female territory size is larger than when there is a scarcity of it. Males try to ensure their paternity by pecking at the cloaca of the female to stimulate ejection of rival males’ sperm. Males take just one-tenth of a second to copulate and can mate more than 100 times a day. Males generally have the best reproductive success in polygynous populations, while females have the advantage during polyandry. When only one female and one male territory overlap, monogamy is preferred. Sometimes, two or three adjacent female territories overlap onemale territory, with the male monopolising several females. Polygynandry also exists, in which two males jointly defend a territory containing several females, but is the most common mating system of dunnocks found in nature. This multiple mating system leads to the development of sperm competition amongst the male suitors. Subsequent mating systems, as discussed below, reflect high reproductive success for males and relatively lower success for females. The main call is a shrill, persistent tseep along with a high trilling note, which betrays the bird's otherwise inconspicuous presence. The song is rapid, thin and tinkling, a sweet warble which can be confused with that of the Eurasian wren,   which is shorter and weaker. It can be mistaken for the European wren. The dunnock builds a neat nest (predominantly from twigs and moss and lined with soft materials such as wool or feathers) Adults typically lay three to five unspotted blue eggs. In pairs, the male and the female invest parental care at similar rates. In trios, the female and alpha male invest more care in chicks than does the beta male. In territories in which females are able to escape from males, both the alpha and beta males share provisioning equally. This last system represents the best case scenario for females, as it helps to ensure maximal care and the success of the young. A study has found that males tend to not discriminate between their own young and those of another male in polyandrous or polygynandrous systems. If a male has greater access to a female, and therefore a higher chance of a successful fertilisation, during a specific mating period, it would provide more care towards the young in such a system. The President of the Confederate States of America was the elected head of state and government of the Confederacy. The power included the responsibility of appointing executive, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the senate. The president also headed the executive branch of government and was commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into service. He was indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a six-year term, and was one of only two nationally elected Confederate officers, the other being the Vice President ofthe Confederate States. The Confederate States Constitution vested the executive power of the Confederates in the president. The constitutional powers of the president were quite similar to those of the President of. the United States of. America, and he could fill vacancies during a recess of the Senate, but he could not reappoint persons previously rejected by it. He could supply Congress with information, recommend legislation, receive ambassadors and other public ministers, see that the federal l government was not.reduced drastically. Jefferson Davis was the president of the Confederate States of America from 1861 to 1865. Davis was imprisoned at Fort Monroe, Virginia, until his release on bail on May 13, 1867. During his confinement the United States Government prepared to bring him to trial for treason and for complicity in the assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln. In November 1868 Davis was brought to trial under a new indictment, but the judges disagreed and the case was referred to the Supreme Court. President Johnson issued a general amnesty in December 1868, and the Supreme court entered a nolle prosequi, thus freeing Davis. The White House of the Confederacy was used by President Davis throughout the existence of his presidency. Later it became a repository for documents, relics, and pictures, and in 1896 it was redesignated the Confederate Museum. The City of Richmond purchased the Brockenbrough house for presentation to the Confederate government for use as an executive mansion. Davis declined to accept the gift but the mansion was leased for his use. The last Cabinet meetings took place at Charlotte, on April 24, and 26, and on May 4; when Davis left Washington, Georgia, the party consisted only of his aides and Postmaster General Reagan. On April 2, 1865, President Davis, his aides, and members of the Cabinet, except Secretary of War Breckinridge, departed from Richmond on the Richmond and Danville Railroad. The Cabinet stayed at Danville, 140 mi southwest of Richmond, until April 10, when, hearing of Lee's surrender, it continued farther south. At Greensboro, North Carolina,. on April 12 the Cabinet met with Generals Johnston and Beauregard and discussed surrender of Johnston's army to General Sherman. As the railroad south of Greensboro had been destroyed, the flight from that location was on horseback and in ambulances, wagons, and carriages. On May 4, Davis and his companions were captured by the U.S. Cavalry at an encampment near Irwinville, May 10, 1865. The United States Cavalry captured them and took them to Fort Monroe.

Andy Murray claims his first Olympic singles victory in Stanislas Wawrinka's sailing race. Lord Coe insists Olympic venues are ""stuffed"" with sports fans. But empty seats can be seen at several sports, including basketball, volleyball and tennis.. Some events still have empty seats and others were disrupted by rain. Police say 16 people have been arrested over ticket touting at the Olympics during the past two days. Three people have also been charged after 182 were held following a Critical Mass cycle ride near the Olympic Park on Friday.. British teams have been competing in basketball, sailing, badminton and judo at the Games. The London 2012 website has been hit by more than 1,000 ticket-totting problems. The number of tickets sold has also been hit with more than 2,000 more than expected. The Olympic Games are expected to be the most successful Games in British Olympic history. The Games are due to run until the end of the year, with the final to be held in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. The games will be followed by a series of Paralympic events in Rio, including the 2012 Paralympics and the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the 2016 Summer Games in Rio. The Olympics have been running in London since 2000, but have not been as successful as they were in London in the 1980s and 1990s. The last time the Games were held in London was in 1988, and the last time they were held was in Vancouver in 1988. The 2012 Games will be the first time London has hosted the Olympics in the Summer Games since the opening ceremony in 1996. The first Games to be staged in London has been held in more than 100 years, the last in 1996, was in London. The current Games are the first to be hosted by a British city in the Olympics' 50-year history, the first since London in 1896. The event will be held at the Olympic Stadium in London, which has been the site of the Games since 1948. The opening ceremony will be broadcast live on BBC2 on Sunday at 8.30pm. The final will take place on Sunday night at the London Olympic Park. Venezuela was one of the three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran Gran Colombia in 1830. For most of the first half of the 20th century, Venezuela was ruled by generally benevolent military strongmen. Democratically elected governments have held sway since 1959. Concerns include: an increasingly politicized military, rampant violent crime, high inflation, and widespread shortages of basic consumer goods, medicine, and medical supplies, overdependence on the petroleum industry with its price fluctuations, and irresponsible mining operations that are endangering the rain forest and indigenous peoples. ""Vesti La Giubba"" is a famous tenor aria from Ruggero Leoncavallo's 1892 opera Pagliacci. It exemplifies the entire notion of the ""tragic clown"": smiling on the outside but crying on the inside. The melody of the song was utilized by the rock band Queen in their 1984 single ""It's a Hard Life"" when frontman Freddie Mercury sang the song's opening lyrics ""I don't want my freedom, there's no reason for living with a broken heart"" The Battle of Bomarsund was fought by an Anglo-French task force against Russian defenses at Bomars Lund during the Crimean War. The Battle was fought in 1832 by Russia in Sund, Åland Islands, in the Baltic Sea. The fortress had not been completed when the war broke out, and was vulnerable against land forces attacking over land. It was possible for steam-powered ships to reach weakly defended sections of the fortress for a short period of time. The battle was won by British cyclist Elizabeth Armistead, who went on to win the first medal for Team GB at the 2012 Olympic Games. ""The aria"" is often regarded as one the most moving in the operatic repertoire of the time. It has been featured in many renditions, mentions, and spoofs. The song was also used in Queen's 1984 single, ""It’s A Hard Life,"" with the lyrics: ""I’m not looking for freedom, I just want a good life"" It was recorded by Enrico Caruso in 1902, 1904 and 1909, among the top selling records of the 78-rpm era.. The New Guinness Book of Records, ed. Peter Matthews, Guinness Publishing. 1995 p.150. During the battle Charles Davis Lucas tossed overboard a shell which had landed on board. For saving his ship he was the first man to be awarded the Victoria Cross. By the end of July 1854, a British fleet of 25 ships had surrounded the fortress and only waited for the French ground troops to arrive. As the situation appeared hopeless, Bomarsund surrendered on 16 August 1854. After the surrender, French and British forces demolished the fortress. British engineers remained until mid-September to ensure it could not be easily rebuilt. In the Treaty of Paris 1856, the entire Åland Islands were demilitarized, which is a status that has been preserved until this day. Three hundred Finnish grenadiers defending the fortress were captured and imprisoned in Lewes in the United Kingdom. They were later allowed to return to Finland, and they returned with a song telling about their battles and imprisonment, called the War of Ålandska Kriget. The Russian Memorial was erected inLewes in 1877 to honour those who died in captivity. In addition to Charles Davis. Lucas several other Victoria Crosses were awarded in the Baltic Theater during the Crimean War. The resulting explosion demolished the tower of Brännklint. The second tower, Notvik, was also lost on 15 August 18 54 after British guns opened fire from their hill opposite to the tower. After eight hours of bombardment they managed to create a gaping hole to the fort. The Russians hoped for the British and French forces to attack over land. However, after the bombardment continued into the 16 August without any indication of landings, it became apparent to the Russian commander that British and. French intended to reduce the fortress with artillery fire. The early surrender came as a surprise of the French and. British. 2,000 men laid down their arms and became prisoners. In 1877, the Russian memorial was erected to honour the soldiers who had died in the battle and were imprisoned in the UK. The memorial was later erected in the Russian Memorial to honour all those who had been captured in the Battle of the Bomarsund and the subsequent Siege of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Cape Farewell (;  ) is a headland on the southern shore of Egger Island, Nunap Isua Archipelago, Greenland. As the southernmost point of the country, it is one of the important landmarks of Greenland. The area is part of the Kujalleq municipality. King Frederick VI Coast stretches from Cape Farewell to Pikiulleq Bay (former spelling 'Pikiutdleq') in the north along the eastern coast of Greenland, along the coast of the North Atlantic. Northumberland was named after the battle; the neighboring village still carries the name Bomarsund. In 2007 Orlando Gough's opera The Finnish Prisoner which tells about the events of 1854 had its premiere performance in Lewes."

10 Things You Should Know About Parkinson’s Disease
by Juan Osorio
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a disease of the basal ganglia characterized by slowness in the initiation and execution of movement, increase muscle tone, tremor at rest, and impaired postural reflexes. It is named after James Parkinson, who, in 1817, wrote a classic essay on “shaking palsy” a disease whose cause is still unknown.
1. There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease.
2. The diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease increases with age, with the peak onset in the 70s and is more common in men by a ratio of 3:2
3. Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease do not occur until 80% of neurons in the substantia nigra are lost. The substantia nigra is located in the midbrain and controls voluntary movement, produces dopamine, and regulates moods.  The dopamine cells begin to die therefore messages from the brain to the body are decreased and leave the person unable to control movements normally.
4. The classic manifestations of Parkinson’s disease often include tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia which are often called the triad.
A. Tremor, often the first sign may be minimal initially therefore the patient is the only one who notices it. The tremor can affect handwriting and is described as “pill rolling” because the thumb and forefinger appear to move in a rotary fashion as if rolling a pill.
B. Rigidity, the second sign, is the increased resistance to passive motion when the limbs are moved through their range of motion. The rigidity is caused by sustained muscle contraction and elicits a complaint of muscle soreness; feeling tired and achy; pain in the head, upper body, spine, or legs.
C. Bradykinesia, the final sign of the triad is particularly evident in the loss of automatic movements. They include blinking of the eyelids, swinging of the arms while walking, swallowing of saliva, self expression with facial and hand movements, and minor movement of postural adjustment.
5.   Genetic factors associated with Parkinson’s disease include 13 genes; environmental factors include exposures
to chemicals such as carbon monoxide and manganese; and the use of illicit drugs such as amphetamine and methamphetamine can also cause Parkinson’s disease.
6.  Exercise can limit decreased mobility, such as muscle atrophy, contractures, and constipation. The American Parkinson Disease Association publishes booklets and videotapes that provide helpful exercises. A physical therapist or occupational therapist may be consulted to design a personal exercise program for the patient. Exercise will not halt the progress but will enhance the patient’s functional ability.
7. Diet is a major importance to patients with Parkinson’s disease because malnutrition and constipation can be serious consequences of inadequate nutrition. Patients should eat foods that are easily chewed and swallowed and should allow
themselves ample time for eating to avoid frustration and encourage independence. Patients are advised to limit their protein intake if they are on levodopa.
8. Parkinson’s can be treated with drug therapy that aims at correcting an imbalance of neurotransmitters within the central nervous system. Each patient must be evaluated to determine which medication is best for them. Some drug classes
include; Dopamine Agonists, Anticholinergics, MAO-B inhibitors and Carbidopa/Levodopa. Levodopa is the most effective and is being used in 70 to 80 percent of all Parkinson’s patients.
9.  Parkinson’s disease can be treated surgically through deep brain stimulation (DBS). This involves placing an electrode in the thalamus, globus pallidus, or subthalamic nucleus and connecting it to a generator placed in the upper chest. The device delivers a specific current to the brain to improve motor function. This procedure is reversible if needed.
10. Parkinson’s disease interesting opinions: Adolf Hitler is said to have had the disease, people who smoke and drink are less likely to develop the disease, and Japan is the only country in the world that has more women than men with Parkinson’s disease.

","Passage:
Sugar plum
A sugar plum is a piece of dragée  or hard candy made of hardened sugar in a small round or oval shape. 

""Plum"" in the name of this confection does not mean plum in the sense of the fruit of the same name, but referred to small size and spherical or oval shape. According to The Atlantic Monthly, traditional sugar plums contained no fruit, but were  instead hardened sugar balls. According to the Huffington Post, these hardened sugar balls were comfits, and often surrounded a seed, nut, or spice. 

History

The term sugar plum came into general usage in the 1600s. At that time, adding layers of sweet which give sugar plums and comfits their hard shell was done through a slow and labour-intensive process called panning. Until the mechanization of the process, it often took several days, and thus the sugar plum was largely a luxury product. In fact, in the 18th century the word plum became British slang for a large pile of money  or a bribe.  However, by the 1860s manufacturers were using steam heat and mechanized rotating pans, and it was then available for mass consumption.

Today, some candy manufacturers have taken ""sugar plum"" literally, creating plum-flavored, plum-shaped candies and marketing them as ""sugar plum candy"". 

In one non-traditional 21st-century take-off on the word ""sugar plum"", in a recipe for home cooks, dried fruit is chopped fine and combined with chopped almonds, honey, and aromatic spices, such as anise seed, fennel seed, caraway seeds, and cardamom. This mixture is rolled into balls, then coated in sugar or shredded coconut. 

In popular culture

Sugar plums are widely associated with Christmas, through cultural phenomena such as the Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker (Composed by Tchaikovsky, 1892), as well as the line ""Visions of sugar plums danced in their heads,"" from Clement C. Moore's poem A Visit from St. Nicholas (1823), better known as ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas.""

In the children's board game Candy Land the character Plumpy, a gingerbread troll, wore a sugar plum around his neck. Receiving the Plumpy card meant the player had to undo most of their progress, which could lead to great frustration and often prolonged the game. The Plumpy character was replaced in 2002 by Mama Gingertree.

Sugar plums have also gained widespread recognition through the poem ""The Sugar Plum Tree"" by Eugene Field. The poem begins ""Have you ever heard of the Sugar-Plum Tree? 'Tis a marvel of great renown!""  ""Sugar Plum"" is also a 1971 jazz song by American jazz pianist Bill Evans, while Sugar Plum Fairies is a Norwegian folk and pop band formed in 2000.

About Katy Perry
She is better known by her stage name Katy Perry, is an American singer-songwriter and musician. Perry was born in Santa Barbara, California, and raised by Christian pastor parents; she grew up listening to only gospel music and sang in church as a child. After earning a GED during her freshman year of high school, she began to pursue a music career. She released a self-titled gospel album in 2001 as Katy Hudson which failed with the closing of its record label that year. She recorded an album with production team The Matrix and completed most of a solo album from 2004–2005, neither of which were released.
After signing on with Capitol Music Group in 2007, her fourth record label in seven years, she adopted the stage name Katy Perry and released her first Internet single, ""Ur So Gay"", that November, which garnered attention but did not chart. She rose to fame with her second single ""I Kissed a Girl"" in 2008, which topped international charts. Perry's first mainstream album, One of the Boys, followed later that year and was eventually announced to be the thirty-third best selling album of 2008 worldwide. It was accredited platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America; ""I Kissed a Girl"" and her second single ""Hot n Cold"" both received multi-platinum certifications. Perry was ranked the 97th Artist of the 2000–10 decade by Billboard. She became known for wearing unconventional style of dress, often combining bold colors and vintage fashion. Her next album, Teenage Dream, was released on August 24, 2010 in the United States.
Perry had a long relationship with Travis McCoy; she is currently engaged to Russell Brand.
Katy Perry was born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson in Santa Barbara, California. The second child of two pastors, she has an older sister and younger brother.Her Evangelical mother, Mary Hudson (née Perry), grew up in Southern California and had ""a tempestuous first marriage in Zimbabwe.""Her father, Keith Hudson, was a West Coast scenester in the 1960s.Perry's maternal aunt and uncle were screenwriter Eleanor Perry and director Frank Perry, through whom she is also related to Charles M. Schwab, the founder of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. Perry is of Portuguese and German ancestry on her mother's side.
Perry was incorporated into her parents' ministry; she sang in their church from ages 9 to 17. She grew up listening to gospel music and was not allowed to listen to what her mother called secular music. Perry attended Christian schools and camps. As a child, Perry learned how to dance in a recreation building in Santa Barbara. She was taught by seasoned dancers and began with swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug. She took her GED after her freshman year of high school and decided to leave school to pursue a career in music. Perry initially started singing ""because I was at that point in my childhood where I was copycatting my sister and everything she did.""Her sister practiced with cassette tapes, and Perry took the tapes herself when her sister was not around. She rehearsed the songs and performed it to her parents, who suggested she should take voice lessons. She grabbed the opportunity and began taking lessons at age nine to 16. She enrolled in at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, and studied Italian opera for a short time.
Perry dated Gym Class Heroes frontman Travis McCoy, whom she met in a recording studio in New York, on and off for several years. After more than a year of friendship and casual dating, they became serious with their relationship right before they embarked into the 2008 Warped Tour. Perry and McCoy broke up in December 2008. The two began dating again in early 2009 and broke up again a few months later. Perry is now engaged to British comedian Russell Brand after he proposed in December 2009. In a YouTube interview, she said Brand would be a ""perfect"" father.

The Catholic Agency For Overseas Development (CAFOD), previously known as the Catholic Fund for Overseas Development, is the Catholic aid agency for England and Wales. It is an international aid agency working to alleviate poverty and suffering in developing countries. It is funded by the Catholic community in England and Wales, the British Government and the general public by donations.

CAFOD was founded in 1962. CAFOD's aims are to promote long-term development; respond to emergencies; raise public awareness of the causes of poverty; speak out on behalf of poor communities; and promote social justice in witness to Christian faith and gospel values. It is also involved in short-term relief. It is a sponsor of the new [http://www.bfriars.ox.ac.uk/casas_intro.php Las Casas Institute] at Blackfriars Hall, University of Oxford.

CAFOD is an agency of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales and part of the Caritas International Federation which operates in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. CAFOD is a member of the DEC Disasters Emergency Committee and the British Overseas Aid Group. In 2010/11 it raised £69 million and employed 369 staff.

History

CAFOD was born when volunteer members of the National Board of Catholic Women organised the first Family Fast Day on Friday, March 11, 1960. In 1962 CAFOD was officially registered as a public charity. In 1965 CAFOD became a member of Caritas Internationalis and in 1969 joined the CIDSE, a collection of European and North American Catholic Charities. In 1979 its first campaign was launched in the Philippines and they kept growing. Caritas in 1987 asked CAFOD to lead and lobby for a worldwide programme on HIV and Aids. In 1993 its first international office was formed in CAFOD Albania. In 1998 offices were formed in Zimbabwe and Kenya and one year later its Kosovo Appeal raised £8 million. In 2005 the MakePovertyHistory rally in Edinburgh was attended by 249000 people and in 2012, on the same year as the Queens Diamond Jubilee, CAFOD celebrated its 50th Anniversary.

International programmes

CAFOD has offices in Bolivia, Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa & Goma), Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan and Zimbabwe. CAFOD also has staff based with partners in Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka.

Passage:
Warschauer Kniefall
Kniefall von Warschau (German for ""Warsaw Genuflection"") refers to a gesture of humility and penance by German Chancellor Willy Brandt towards the victims of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. 

Incident

The event took place on December 7, 1970, in what was then the Communist People's Republic of Poland during a visit to a monument to the Nazi-era Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. After laying down a wreath, Brandt, very surprisingly, and to all appearances spontaneously, knelt. He remained silently in that position for a short time, surrounded by a large group of dignitaries and press photographers.

Brandt had actively resisted the early Nazi regime, and had spent most of the time of Hitler's reign in exile. The occasion of Brandt's visit to Poland at the time was the signing of the Treaty of Warsaw between West Germany and the People's Republic of Poland, guaranteeing German acceptance of the new borders of Poland. The treaty was one of the Brandt-initiated policy steps (the 'Ostpolitik') to ease tensions between West and East during the Cold War.

Reaction

In Germany

On the same day, Brandt signed the Treaty of Warsaw, which acknowledged the Oder-Neisse-Line as the final German border with Poland. Both actions attracted controversy within Germany, as did Ostpolitik in general, favored only by a narrow majority in public opinion. It was disputed within his own party, whose voters had included a significant proportion of expellees from the formerly German territories in Poland, most whom then went to the conservative parties.

According to a Der Spiegel survey of the time, 48% of all West Germans thought the ""Kniefall"" was excessive, 41% said it was appropriate and 11% had no opinion.  The Kniefall was a symbolic action the opposition tried to use against Brandt, as in a Constructive Vote of No Confidence in April 1972, which Brandt won by only two votes. Brandt's landslide win in the next elections in late 1972 was also due to the growing view among voters that Brandt's Ostpolitik—symbolized by the Kniefall—and his reformist domestic policies were helping to boost Germany's international reputation and should be supported. The SPD won its best federal election result ever.

Internationally

While at the time, positive reactions may have been limited, his show of humility was a small but vital step in bridging the gaps World War II had left between Germany and Eastern Europe. In historical terms, Brandt gained much renown for this act, and it is thought to be one of the reasons he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971.

A monument to Willy Brandt was unveiled on 6 December 2000, in Willy Brandt Square in Warsaw (near the Warsaw Ghetto Heroes Monument) on the eve of the 30th anniversary of his famous gesture.

Brandt's memories

Brandt was repeatedly interviewed about the genuflection and about his motives. He later noted that:

(German original) ""Unter der Last der jüngsten Geschichte tat ich, was Menschen tun, wenn die Worte versagen. So gedachte ich Millionen Ermordeter."" 

(English translation) Under the weight of recent history, I did what people do when words fail them. In this way I commemorated millions of murdered people.

Kniefall von Warschau (German for 'Warsaw Genuflection') is a 1970 incident involving which European statesman who paid homage to WWII's Warsaw Ghetto Uprising during his visit to the city?
Answer:
Willy Brandt
Passage:
Gillespie Road
Gillespie Road is a road in Highbury, north London, running east-west along the north side of the Arsenal Stadium, previously home of Arsenal Football Club. Arsenal tube station was originally named Gillespie Road, before being given its current name in 1932 following pressure from the club. At the time of Arsenal's move to the nearby Emirates Stadium in July 2006, an email was circulated by  supporters of  rival club Tottenham Hotspur inviting petitions to the Mayor of London, asking him to give the station back its original name [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?viewDETAILS&grid
&xml=/sport/2006/01/14/sfndry14.xml] which proved unsuccessful. The Gillespie Road name, however, is famously displayed on the original Edwardian platform tiling to this day.

Passage:
Laughing Cavalier
The Laughing Cavalier (1624) is a portrait by the Dutch Golden Age painter Frans Hals in the Wallace Collection in London, which has been described as ""one of the most brilliant of all Baroque portraits"".  The title is an invention of the Victorian public and press, dating from its exhibition in the opening display at the Bethnal Green Museum in 1872–75, just after its arrival in England, after which it was regularly reproduced as a print, and became among of the best known old master paintings in Britain. The unknown subject is in fact not laughing, but can be said to have an enigmatic smile, much amplified by his upturned moustache.

Description

The portrait measures 83 × 67.3 cm (32.7 × 26.5 in) and is inscribed at top right ""Æ'TA SVÆ 26/A°1624"", which expands to ""aetatis suae 26, anno 1624"" in Latin and means that the portrait was painted when the sitter was 26 and in the year 1624.   The identity of the man was unknown for centuries, and though the recorded 19th century titles in Dutch, English and French mostly suggest a military man, or at least an officer in one of the part-time militia companies that were often the subjects of group portraits, including some by Hals and later Rembrandt's Night Watch (1642), in fact he was as likely to be a wealthy civilian and Pieter Biesboer has identified him as Tieleman Roosterman.  The composition is lively and spontaneous, and despite the apparent labour involved in the gorgeous, and very expensive, silk costume, close inspection reveals long, quick brush strokes. The turning pose and low viewpoint are found in other portraits by Hals and here allow emphasis on the embroidered sleeve and lace cuff.  There are many emblems in the embroidery: signifying ""the pleasures and pains of love"" are ""bees, arrows, flaming cornucopiae, lovers' knots and tongues of fire"", while an obelisk or pyramid signifies strength and Mercury's cap and caduceus fortune. 

In general, commissioned portraits such as this rarely showed adults smiling until the late 18th century, though smiling is often seen in tronies and figures in genre painting.  But Hals is an exception to the general rule and often showed sitters with broader smiles than here, and in informal poses that bring an impression of movement and spontaneity to his work. 

The effect of the eyes appearing to follow the viewer from every angle is a result of the subject being depicted as looking directly forward, toward the artist's point of view, combined with being a static two dimensional representation of this from whichever angle the painting itself is viewed. 

History

The painting's provenance only goes back to a sale in The Hague in 1770; after further Dutch sales it was bought by the Franco-Swiss banker and collector the Comte de Pourtalès-Gorgier in 1822.  After his death the painting was acquired at the auction of his collection in Paris in 1865 by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, who outbid Baron James de Rothschild at more than six times the sales estimate.  It was in Hertford's Paris home in 1871, listed as portrait d'un homme (""portrait of a man""), and then brought to London, probably for the purpose of exhibiting it in a large and long loan exhibition of old master paintings at Bethnal Green, which was deliberately sited away from the West End of London to attract the working classes.  The exhibition was a huge success and A Cavalier (the catalogue title) a particular hit with both public and the critics; it played a considerable part in raising the critical estimation of Hals in England.  By 1888, when it was again exhibited at the Royal Academy, it had become Laughing Cavalier, though a cleaning in the intervening period (in 1884) may have changed the effect.   The critic in the Athenaeum noted a brighter appearance, but also that ""The man smiles rather than laughs"".  Hertford's collection was bequeathed to his natural son Sir Richard Wallace Bt., whose widow donated it and his London house to the nation as the Wallace Collection.

Derivatives

The Laughing Cavalier is used by McEwan's beer as its logo. It has been modified showing the Laughing Cavalier enjoying the beer. 

In the Scarlet Pimpernel adventure series by Emma Orczy, The Laughing Cavalier is a prequel recounting the story of the supposed subject of the painting, who is an ancestor of her main hero, the Scarlet Pimpernel, Sir Percy Blakeney.

The ""eyes following you round the room"" trope has long been a stand-by in British comedy, used by Pete and Dud in The Art Gallery,  among many others, sometimes in the form of a portrait with cut-away eyes that can be used as a peephole.

Passage:
Carl Douglas
Carlton George Douglas (born 10 May 1942), also known by his stage name Carl Douglas, is a Jamaican recording artist. Douglas rose to prominence after releasing his single ""Kung Fu Fighting"".

Early life

Carlton George Douglas was born on 10 May 1942 in Kingston, Jamaica.

Career

Douglas' career was based in the United Kingdom, where his single ""Kung Fu Fighting"" ranked number one in both the U.K. Singles Chart and the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1974. The single sold 11 million copies worldwide,   making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. The single was later certified gold by the RIAA on 27 November 1974. 

The single, which is a homage to martial arts films, has overshadowed the rest of Douglas' career; resulting in his appearance on cover versions of the single. In the United States, Douglas was considered a ""one-hit wonder"" since he was only known for ""Kung Fu Fighting"". However, in the United Kingdom, he has two other singles that made it into the ""Top 40"", which were ""Dance the Kung Fu"", which peaked at number 35 in the charts; and ""Run Back"", which peaked at number 25.

Douglas was once managed by Eric Woolfson,  who later became the primary songwriter behind ""The Alan Parsons Project"".

In 1998, a re-recording of ""Kung Fu Fighting"", performed by British dance act Bus Stop and which featured Douglas's vocals, peaked at number 8 in the ""UK Singles Chart"". 

The single ""Dance The Kung Fu"", was sampled on ""Cuda nie widy"" from 2001 album Nibylandia, and later by DJ Premier on his 2007 remix of Nike's 25th Air Force One anniversary single ""Classic (Better Than I've Ever Been)"", featuring Kanye West, Nas, KRS-One and Rakim. Douglas is represented by music publisher Schacht Musikverlage (SMV) in Hamburg, Germany.

Passage:
Kosheh massacres
Twenty-one Coptic Christians were the victims of a massacre in el-Kosheh village in Upper Egypt, located 450 kilometres south of Cairo, on Sunday 2 January 2000. The Coptic Christians killed in this incident were considered martyrs of the Coptic Orthodox Church by Pope Shenouda III.

Kosheh

Kosheh is located on the east bank of the Nile in Sohag governorate, a few miles east of Balyana. The population of Kosheh is about 35,000 and 70% of the village are Christian Copts. Kosheh is the trading center for a number of villages in the area. There is little farmland in Kosheh; it serves rather as the shopping nexus for the rural areas around it. Most of the shopkeepers are Copts, while most of the farmers in the surrounding villages are Muslims from Arab tribes.  

First Kosheh Massacre

Tensions between Christians and Muslims had started a few years earlier, in August 1998, in what is known as the First Kosheh Massacre. In this incident, two Copts were murdered by Muslims. The Muslims in turn were allegedly seeking revenge for the “poisoning” of a brother who had actually died of natural causes. In response, the Egyptian police responded by rounding up about 1,200 Christians for investigation into the murder. When Metropolitan Wissa of el-Balyana (Abydos), whose diocese includes el-Kosheh, criticised the arrests, he was himself arrested with two of his priests, and was charged with inciting strife and damaging national unity between Christians and Muslims.

In October 1998, an article by Christina Lamb in London’s Daily Telegraph reported that some of the arrested Copts had undergone mock crucifixions and that Metropolitan Wissa faced possible execution. The Egyptian government was outraged at the negative publicity, and arrested the head of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR), whom it accused of having given the story to the Daily Telegraph. The head of the EOHR and Metropolitan Wissa were eventually released. Although the government promised to punish any police who had acted improperly, some of the police officers involved in the human rights violations against the Copts in el-Kosheh were in fact promoted. Thus, the First Kosheh Massacre turned into an international incident. As a result, Coptic groups in the West began to push for the US Congress to include Egypt among nations that discriminate against Christians.

Second Kosheh Massacre

The Second Kosheh Massacre took place about one year later, on Friday 31 December 1999. The incidence stemmed from a quarrel between a Christian merchant and a Muslim customer. The misunderstanding strained Muslim-Christian relations in the community. Relatives of the Muslim customer targeted Christian-owned shops and homes, which were looted, destroyed, and burned. Initially, the police was able to contain the situation. However, two days later on Sunday 2 January 2000, riots spread violence into neighbouring villages and lead to the murders of 20 Christians. One Muslim was also accidentally shot dead by a fellow Muslim.   More than 40 people were injured in the two-day incident. 260 shops, houses and kiosks were also deliberately burnt or damaged. Most of the killings took place in the outskirts of el-Kosheh, especially in the agriculture fields. This event was one of Egypt's bloodiest massacres.

The local authorities during the incident did little to control the situation. There were some cases where these officers participated in the killings.
Following the massacre, the entire Coptic community felt that these events epitomised the criminal negligence of the Egyptian administration, represented in its police force, when it comes to protecting Coptic lives and property. Since local police units are often drawn from the local community, local feuds including Muslim resentment of Christian families can very well color police behaviour.

On 1 December 2000, a criminal court in Egypt's Sohag governorate released without bail all 89 defendants charged in the New Year's massacre in el-Kosheh. It was unprecedented in Egypt that several dozen murder suspects would be released without bail a month before their verdict was determined. All suspects that were initially arrested in connection to this massacre were eventually acquitted had their charges dropped. The only person convicted in the massacre was a Muslim charged with accidental killing of another Muslim, and sentenced to 13 years in prison.  No one was ever convicted for the murder of the 21 Christian victims. This led to outrage in the Coptic community who felt that these suspects should be in custody. The Pope of Alexandria Shenouda III rejected the verdict openly, and told reporters ""We want to challenge this ruling. We don't accept it."" Metropolitan Wissa of el-Balyana (Abydos), whose diocese includes el-Kosheh, called the ruling ""A shame that defames the reputation of Egypt and an invitation for more violence"". Egypt's Prosecutor General Maher Abdel Wahid appealed the acquittal verdict of the defendants, stating that ""there is no doubt that 21 people were killed, and the killers must be brought to justice,"" ""We never imagined that they would release the killers, but this is Egypt"" a Copt from el-Kosheh admitted by telephone.

Six days following the acquittal of the defendants, the homes of four Christian families in el-Kosheh were set to fire and completely destroyed. One of the homeowners who reported the arson to the Egyptian police was tortured and forced to sign a statement prepared by a public prosecutor charging him with perpetrating the whole incident. He was subsequently forced to post bail for his own release.

Passage:
Dolomite
Dolomite is an anhydrous carbonate mineral composed of calcium magnesium carbonate, ideally CaMg(CO3)2. The word dolomite is also used to describe the sedimentary carbonate rock, which is composed predominantly of the mineral dolomite (also known as dolostone).

History

Most probably the mineral dolomite was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1768.  In 1778, it was described by the Austrian naturalist Belsazar Hacquet as the ""stinking stone"" (, ).   In 1791, it was described as a rock by the French naturalist and geologist Déodat Gratet de Dolomieu (1750–1801), first in buildings of the old city of Rome, and later as samples collected in what is now known as the Dolomite Alps of northern Italy. Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure first named the mineral (after Dolomieu) in March 1792.  Hacquet and Dolomieu met in Laibach (Ljubljana) in 1784,  which may have contributed to Dolomieu's work.

Properties

The mineral dolomite crystallizes in the trigonal-rhombohedral system. It forms white, tan, gray, or pink crystals. Dolomite is a double carbonate, having an alternating structural arrangement of calcium and magnesium ions. It does not rapidly dissolve or effervesce (fizz) in dilute hydrochloric acid as calcite does. Crystal twinning is common.

Solid solution exists between dolomite, the iron-dominant ankerite and the manganese-dominant kutnohorite.Klein, Cornelis and Cornelius S. Hurlbut Jr., Manual of Mineralogy, Wiley, 20th ed., p. 339-340 ISBN 0-471-80580-7 Small amounts of iron in the structure give the crystals a yellow to brown tint. Manganese substitutes in the structure also up to about three percent MnO. A high manganese content gives the crystals a rosy pink color. Lead, zinc, and cobalt also substitute in the structure for magnesium. The mineral dolomite is closely related to huntite Mg3Ca(CO3)4.

Because dolomite can be dissolved by slightly acidic water, areas of dolomite are important as aquifers and contribute to karst terrain formation. 

Formation

Modern dolomite formation has been found to occur under anaerobic conditions in supersaturated saline lagoons along the Rio de Janeiro coast of Brazil, namely, Lagoa Vermelha and Brejo do Espinho.  It is often thought that dolomite will develop only with the help of sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g. Desulfovibrio brasiliensis).  However, low-temperature dolomite may occur in natural environments rich in organic matter and microbial cell surfaces. This occurs as a result of magnesium complexation by carboxyl groups associated with organic matter. 

Vast deposits of dolomite are present in the geological record, but the mineral is relatively rare in modern environments. Reproducible, inorganic low-temperature syntheses of dolomite and magnesite were published for the first time in 1999. Those laboratory experiments showed how the initial precipitation of a metastable ""precursor"" (such as magnesium calcite) will change gradually into more and more of the stable phase (such as dolomite or magnesite) during periodical intervals of dissolution and re-precipitation. The general principle governing the course of this irreversible geochemical reaction has been coined ""breaking Ostwald's step rule"". 

There is some evidence for a biogenic occurrence of dolomite. One example is that of the formation of dolomite in the urinary bladder of a Dalmatian dog, possibly as the result of an illness or infection. 

Formation of dolomite from solution and its link with biogenic dolomite

In 2015, it was experimentally discovered that the direct crystallization of dolomite can occur from solution at temperatures between 60–220 °C. Dolomite forms through a three-stage process: 1) A nanoparticulate magnesium-deficient, amorphous calcium carbonate (Mg-ACC) forms; 2) After a temperature-dependent induction time, this Mg-ACC partially dehydrates and orders prior to its rapid (<5 min) crystallization to non-stoichiometric proto-dolomite (with a lower Mg/Ca ratio compared to dolomite). This occurs via the dissolution of Mg-ACC, followed by the secondary nucleation of proto-dolomite from solution. 3) Finally, the proto-dolomite crystallization proceeds via spherulitic growth that follows a growth front nucleation mechanism with a de novo and continuous formation of nanocrystalline proto-dolomite subunits that form spherical aggregates. In stage three of the reaction, the proto-dolomite transforms to highly crystalline and stoichiometric dolomite on a much longer timescale (hours to days), via an Ostwald-ripening mechanism. Such a three-stage crystallization can explain microbially induced proto-dolomites observed in modern hypersaline settings and may also be the route by which the Cryogenian cap dolomite deposits of the Neoproterozoic formed. 

Uses

Dolomite is used as an ornamental stone, a concrete aggregate, and a source of magnesium oxide, as well as in the Pidgeon process for the production of magnesium. It is an important petroleum reservoir rock, and serves as the host rock for large strata-bound Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) ore deposits of base metals such as lead, zinc, and copper. Where calcite limestone is uncommon or too costly, dolomite is sometimes used in its place as a flux for the smelting of iron and steel. Large quantities of processed dolomite are used in the production of float glass.

In horticulture, dolomite and dolomitic limestone are added to soils and soilless potting mixes as a pH buffer and as a magnesium source. Home and container gardening are common examples of this use.

Dolomite is also used as the substrate in marine (saltwater) aquariums to help buffer changes in pH of the water.

Calcined dolomite is also used as a catalyst for destruction of tar in the gasification of biomass at high temperature. 

Particle physics researchers like to build particle detectors under layers of dolomite to enable the detectors to detect the highest possible number of exotic particles. Because dolomite contains relatively minor quantities of radioactive materials, it can insulate against interference from cosmic rays without adding to background radiation levels. 

Dolomite is a popular choice for motorcycle speedway tracks throughout Australia and New Zealand.

Dolomite is used in the ceramic industry and in studio pottery as a glaze ingredient, contributing magnesium and calcium as glass melt fluxes.

Farringford House
Farringford was the much loved home of Poet Laureate, Alfred Lord Tennyson, for forty years until his death in 1892. The main house dates from 1806 with gothic embellishments and extensions added from the 1830s. Of particular historical importance is the second library built by Lady Emily Tennyson in 1871 with a play room below connected by a turreted winding staircase. The grounds are laid to lawn, rose borders and informal planting. Evidence remains of Tennyson's planting schemes together with a section of the walled garden and wooden footpaths.

The house and grounds are currently undergoing a programme of restoration having been a hotel since it left the Tennyson family's ownership in the 1940s. The house is scheduled to open in 2016 as a study centre and will host group visits, writer's retreats, creative workshops, concerts and exhibitions. On the estate there are fourteen 4* self-catering cottages available all year round, a helicopter landing pad, a restaurant which caters to both guests and local residents, a 9-hole golf course, outdoor heated swimming pool, tennis court and children's play area. 

The estate is located on Bedbury Lane, Freshwater Bay, on the Western tip of the Isle of Wight. Some of the surrounding houses, particularly those in Middleton at the start of Moons Hill are connected with the Farringford's history, once forming part of the estate. The houses at the end of Queens Road, the junction near the farm used to be stables where Fred Pontin's horses where kept.

Southern Vectis' Needles Breezer Open Top bus has a stop outside the Farringford and this is the only bus that goes down Bedbury Lane towards Alum Bay.

Tennyson wrote of Farringford:

Tennyson rented Farringford in 1853, and then bought it in 1856.  He found that there were too many starstruck tourists who pestered him in Farringford, so he moved to ""Aldworth"", a stately home on a hill known as Blackdown between Lurgashall and Fernhurst, about 2 km south of Haslemere in West Sussex in 1869. However, he returned to Farringford to spend the winters.

Passage:
Ophidiophobia
Ophidiophobia or ophiophobia is a particular type of specific phobia, the abnormal fear of snakes. Fear of snakes is sometimes called by a more general term, herpetophobia, fear of reptiles and/or amphibians. The word comes from the Greek words ""ophis"" () which refers to snake and ""phobia"" () meaning fear. 

Care must also be taken to differentiate people who do not like snakes or fear them for their venom or the inherent danger involved. An  ophidiophobe would not only fear them when in live contact but also dreads to think about them or even see them on TV or in pictures. 

About a third of adult humans are ophidiophobic, making this the most common reported phobia.  Scientists have theorised that humans may have an innate reaction to snakes, which was vital for the survival of humankind as it allowed such dangerous threats to be identified immediately. 

Fictional cases

Population mythbusters
It’s widely believed that New Zealand has 20 sheep for every person – information that adds weight to myriad sheep jokes. How accurate is this these days?
To begin with, we must find out how many people live in New Zealand. The population passed the 4 million mark in 2003. Our  population clock put the event at precisely 5.30 pm on Thursday, 24 April. By 30 June 2015, the estimated resident population had reached 4.60 million people.
Next, we must find out how many sheep we have. According to Statistics NZ's agricultural production statistics, we had an estimated 29.5 million sheep at 30 June 2015.
This means that the sheep-to-person ratio has fallen and contrary to popular belief there are actually about six sheep per person, not 20.
Conclusion
This myth is busted. The information is now out of date.
However, it is still true that people in New Zealand are greatly outnumbered by sheep, and our sheep-to-person ratio is high relative to other countries. It’s still twice as high as Australia's, for example, which currently has fewer than three sheep per person. As with New Zealand, this is due to declining sheep numbers and a growing human population.
New Zealanders have also long been outnumbered by cattle, although not to the same extent as by sheep. There are currently 6.4 million dairy and 3.6 million beef cattle in New Zealand. While the cattle population is growing at a slower rate than the human population, there has been a notable shift in the make-up of the cattle population. In 1994, 43.2 percent of cattle were dairy cattle. By 2015, that proportion had increased to 64.0 percent.
A bit of sheep history
New Zealand sheep numbers peaked in 1982, with a total of 70.3 million sheep. In the same year, 3.18 million people lived in New Zealand. This works out to 22 sheep per person.
Sheep numbers have gradually declined since the mid-1980s, due to factors such as depressed wool prices, droughts in the 1990s, and competition from other land-intensive farming activities (eg dairy and forestry). While sheep numbers stabilised and even grew slightly in the mid-2000s, numbers soon decreased again, reaching the low of 29.5 million in 2015.
Some sheep facts from  An Encyclopedia of New Zealand for the historians among us:
New Zealand's first sheep were set ashore by Captain Cook in 1773.
Rapid sheep population growth in the 1850s and 1860s was due mostly to permanent immigration, rather than natural increase. In 1864 alone, 13,000 sheep arrived in Canterbury from Australia. Droughts meant that sheep could always be bought cheaply from Australia. Drought continues to affect Australian farmers and sheep numbers.
The first shipment of frozen lamb and mutton sailed to London from Port Chalmers on the Dunedin in 1882.

Passage:
Sabatier
Sabatier is the maker's mark used by several kitchen knife manufacturers—by itself it is not a registered brand name. The name Sabatier is considered to imply a high-quality knife produced by one of a number of manufacturers in the Thiers region of France using a fully forged process; the knives of some of these manufacturers are highly regarded. However, the name ""Sabatier"" came into use before intellectual property laws and is not protected; knives legally bearing the name range from high-quality knives made in France to cheap mass-produced products of poor quality from France and other countries; a registered logo or full name, or both, such as ""65 Sabatier Perrier"", is necessary to establish origin and quality.

Origins

The name originated in Thiers, France at the beginning of the 19th century. The area of Thiers has been associated with the cutlery industry since the Middle Ages.  With the advent of the industrial age manufacturers began to consolidate their crafts or trades by creating brand or trade marks.

Early controversy

Two separate families began using the name Sabatier to market their knives. The families do not appear to be related except by name and craft. Jean Sabatier of Le Moutier (lower Thiers) and Phillipe Sabatier of Bellevue (upper Thiers). There is much dispute who registered the trademark first with each citing evidence.

Brand names

The use of the Sabatier name is an anomaly of ""branding"" because the name was used by many different companies before intellectual property or trademark laws were fully established in France. In order to distinguish between the various makers of Sabatier knives, manufacturers are required to include a second word or symbol along with SABATIER. Over the years many marks were registered. In 1979, after the sale of the Moutier Sabatier brands to Cuisinox, the various holders of the brands formed an association to protect the brand name.

Manufacturing process

Among the many Sabatier manufacturers in Thiers, France, most provide high quality cutlery using traditional forging techniques that were developed in the area in the early and mid-19th century. Most of these manufacturers use a ""fully forged"" technique and a hand shaping and sharpening process using local skilled labour.

Fully forged means that three of the four knife parts (blade, bolster, tang and handle) are forged from a single piece of steel. In this process, a single cylinder shaped steel billet is heated where the bolster will be, and squeezed from the ends to create a bulge. The entire piece is heated again and forged to the shape of the blade, bolster, and tang using forging dies in one operation. Afterward, a clipping tool is used to cut the forged piece to the rough shape of the knife. Finally, the handles are riveted on, and the final shaping and sharpening is done by hand. The alternative way to manufacture knives is stamping; forging has traditionally been considered superior, but from the late 20th century some knives of excellent quality have been produced by stamping.

Confusion continues

While there are many knife manufacturers using Sabatier as their brand, some Sabatier manufacturers are considered authentic, and some are not. Generally speaking among connoisseurs of fine cutlery, only knives manufactured in Thiers, France from well established manufacturers from the 19th century are considered ""genuine"" Sabatier knives.

Many other manufacturers, both in France and elsewhere, use the Sabatier name on their knives; however, they are usually mass-produced, and of poor quality.  Neither words such as vrai or garanti, nor ""Made in France"", ensure a good knife.

Companies selling Sabatier knives

Sabatier brands have been sold on to many companies over the years. The following list is an attempt to link the present day owners to the brands.

ETS Sabatier Aîné & Perrier

Sabatier Aîné & Perrier claim to be the oldest Sabatier knife maker still in existence and operated by the descendants of Phillipe Sabatier of Bellevue, Thiers, France. They have operated for more than 150 years and have sold under the brand name [Sabatier-k] since 1834. First references to the mark ""K"" can be found in the town archives, engraved on the Silver Tablet of Cutlers, dated 7 June 1813 under number 231.

Katy Perry was born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson in Santa Barbara, California. She released a self-titled gospel album in 2001 as Katy Hudson which failed with the closing of its record label that year. She rose to fame with her second single ""I Kissed a Girl"" in 2008, which topped international charts. Her first mainstream album, One of the Boys, followed later that year and was eventually announced to be the thirty-third best selling album of 2008 worldwide. Her next album, Teenage Dream, was released on August 24, 2010 in the United States. Perry had a long relationship with Travis McCoy; she is currently engaged to Russell Brand. In a YouTube interview, she said Brand would be a ""perfect"" father. Perry is of Portuguese and German ancestry on her mother's side. Her maternal aunt and uncle were screenwriter Eleanor Perry and director Frank Perry, through whom she is also related to Charles M. Schwab, the founder of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. Her father, Keith Hudson, was a West Coast scenester in the 1960s. She took her GED after her freshman year of high school and decided to leave school to pursue a career in music. Perry initially started singing ""because I was copycatting my sister and everything she did."" Her sister practiced with cassette tapes, and Perry took the tapes herself when her sister was not around. She rehearsed the songs and performed it to her parents, who suggested she should take voice lessons. She grabbed the opportunity and began taking lessons at age nine to 16. She enrolled in at the Music Academy of the West inSanta Barbara, and studied Italian opera for a short time. Perry was ranked the 97th Artist of the 2000–10 decade by Billboard. She became known for wearing unconventional style of dress, often combining bold colors and vintage fashion. Perry and McCoy broke up in December 2008. The two began dating again in early 2009 and broke up again a few months later. She is now engaged to British comedian Russell Brand after he proposed in December 2009. The couple have a son, Jo. CAFOD's aims are to promote long-term development; respond to emergencies; raise public awareness of the causes of poverty; speak out on behalf of poor communities. It is funded by the Catholic community in England and Wales, the British Government and the general public by donations. In 2010/11 it raised £69 million and employed 369 staff. CAFOD has offices in Bolivia, Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa & Goma), Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan and Zimbabwe. In 2005 the MakePovertyHistory rally in Edinburgh was attended by 249,000 people and in 2012, on the same year as the Queens Diamond Jubilee, CAFod celebrated its 50th Anniversary. The Kniefall von Warschau refers to a gesture of humility and penance by German Chancellor Willy Brandt towards the victims of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The event took place on December 7, 1970, in what was then the Communist People's Republic of Poland during a visit to a monument to the Nazi-era Polish Ghetto. After laying down a wreath, Brandt, very surprisingly, and to all appearances spontaneously, knelt. He remained silently in that position for a short time, surrounded by a large group of dignitaries and press photographers. On the same day Brandt signed the Treaty of Warsaw, which acknowledged the Oder-Neisse-Line as the final German border with Poland. Both actions attracted controversy within Germany, as did Ostpolitik in general, favored only by a narrow majority in public opinion. It was disputed within his own party, whose voters had included a significant proportion of expellees from the formerly German territories in Poland, most of whom then went to the conservative parties. According to a survey of the West Germans at the time, 48% of all West Germans thought the ""Kniefall"" was excessive and 11% said it was appropriate and appropriate. In the abbrevation CAF OD - for what does the 'O' stand? The answer is: 'Overseas. Diocese of Oxford' The charity is part of the Caritas International Federation which operates in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. The Kniefall von Warschau (German for 'Warsaw Genuflection') is a 1970 incident involving which European statesman who paid homage to WWII's Warsaw Ghetto Uprising during his visit to the city. Willy Brandt won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971 for his act. The relative frequency of the surname Braithwaite was highest in Westmorland (37.3 times the British average), followed by Cumberland, Yorkshire, Linlithgowshire, Lancashire, County Durham, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Anglesey and Flintshire. Arsenal tube station was originally named Gillespie Road, before being given its current name in 1932 following pressure from the club. At the time of Arsenal's move to the nearby Emirates Stadium in July 2006, an email was circulated by supporters of rival club Tottenham Hotspur inviting petitions to the Mayor of London, asking him to give the station back its original name. The Gillespie Road name, however, is famously displayed on the original Edwardian platform tiling to this day. Notable people with the surname include: Sir Albert Braith WAite (1893–1959), British politician.Bob BraithWAite (1925–2015), British trap shooter.Brenda Brathwaite (born 1966), American video game designer and developer.Doug Kamara (born 1937), Welsh professional boxer.Donald Braith Waite ( born 1937), Barbadian comic book artist, writer and teacher. George Gurney (disambiguation) (1895–1958), fictional character in Julian Barnes's novel Parrot Baronet (1958–1995) The name 'Gillespie Road' is a road in Highbury, north London, running east-west along the north side of the Arsenal Stadium, previously home of Arsenal Football Club. It was originally called Gillespie Road in the 1930's, but was renamed after the club's founder, Arsene Wenger, in 1932. The name Gillespie Road is still used on the station's platform tiled to thisday. It is also the name of a tube station in London, which was originally known as Gillespie Road. The station's name was changed to Gillespie Road by London Transport in 1930's after pressure from Arsenal football club. The current name is Gillespie Road and was given to the station by the London Transport Authority in 1932, following pressure by the club’s founder, Arsenal Wenger. The road is now known as the ‘Arsenal Road’ and is located in the north of Highbury in north London. The Braithwaite family is a group of New Zealand and New Zealand politicians, musicians, actors and musicians. The family includes the fictional character in the Adrian Mole series by British author Sue Townsend. The portrait by Frans Hals, The Laughing Cavalier (1624), is one of the best known old master paintings in Britain. It is on display at the Green Museum in Bethnal Green, London, and measures 83 × 67.3 cm (32.5 x 26.5 inches) The portrait is inscribed ""A'ÆÆ'TA 26/5 SV 26/6/7"" (A.S.V.A. 26/7/7) and is in the Wallace Collection in London, which is owned by the National Gallery of Art, London. It has been described as ""one of the most brilliant of all the Dutch Baroque portraits"" and is on public display in the Green museum. The BraithWAite family also includes the Canadian novelist, spoken word artist, dub poet, essayist, digital drummer and short fiction writer Jahron Anthony Brathwaite aka PartyNextDoor, Canadian singer, songwriter, record producer and rapper. They also include the New Zealand politician, mayor of Dunedin, New Zealand bookseller and politician, and Jamaican reggae musician Junior Braithwain (1949–1999), New Zealand football player and manager. They are also the parents of Australian television presenter and reporter Jessica Braithwan (1948–2012) and Canadian singer-songwriter-producer Jeffrey Brathwan (2012–2014) The family is descended from Richard Brathwain or Brathwait (1588–1673), an English poet and philosopher. They include: Joseph Bevan Braithwait (1818–1905), English Quaker minister; Leonard Braithway (1923–2012), Canadian lawyer and politician; Kraigg Brathway (born 1992), West Indian cricket international; Martin Braith waite (born 1991), Danish footballer; Stuart BraithWaite (1911–1995), Canadian novelist and non-fiction author. They have also included: Sir Nicholas Brath waite, prime minister of Grenada; Sir Rodric Braith WAite, British diplomat and author; Tut Braith Waite, a British rock climber and mountaineer; Walter Braithweite (1865–1945), British Army general during WWI. The painting's provenance only goes back to a sale in The Hague in 1770. After further Dutch sales it was bought by the Franco-Swiss banker and collector the Comte de Pourtalès-Gorgier in 1822. It was in Hertford's Paris home in 1871, listed as portrait d'un homme (""portrait of a man""), and then brought to London, probably for the purpose of exhibiting it in a large and long loan exhibition of old master paintings at Bethnal Green. The effect of the eyes appearing to follow the viewer from every angle is a result of the subject being depicted as looking directly forward, toward the artist's point of view. In the Scarlet Pimpernel adventure series by Emma Orczy, The Laughing Cavalier is a prequel recounting the story of the supposed subject of the painting, who is an ancestor of her main hero, Sir Percy Blakeney. The painting is used by McEwan's beer as its logo. It has been modified showing the Laughed Cavalier enjoying the beer, but the original image is still the same. The picture was a huge success and a particular hit with both public and the critics. It played a considerable part in raising the critical estimation of Hals in England. It is now owned by Sir Richard Wallace Bt., whose widow donated it and his London house to the nation as the Wallace Collection. A Cavalier (the catalogue title) by Carl Douglas rose to prominence as a recording artist after releasing his single ""Kung Fu Fighting"" (1942) Carl Douglas is also known by his stage name Carlton George Douglas (1940-1974) He is a Jamaican-born singer-songwriter who lived in the UK and the U.S. and had a successful solo career in the 1960s and 1970s. He is the father of the musician and TV presenter Carl Douglas, who lives in New York City and has a successful television show, ""Carlton George Do Do"" (2013-2014). He is also the grandfather of the British-born musician and television presenter, David Douglas. He lives in the United States with his wife and two children, who live in Los Angeles and New York. Douglas' career was based in the United Kingdom, where his single ""Kung Fu Fighting"" ranked number one in both the U.K. Singles Chart and U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1974. The single sold 11 million copies worldwide,   making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. Douglas was once managed by Eric Woolfson,  who later became the primary songwriter behind ""The Alan Parsons Project"" Douglas is represented by music publisher Schacht Musikverlage (SMV) in Hamburg, Germany. His single ""Dance The Kung Fu"", was sampled on ""Cuda nie widy"" from 2001 album Nibylandia, and later by DJ Premier on his 2007 remix of Nike's 25th Air Force One anniversary single ""Classic (Better Than I've Ever Been)"", featuring Kanye West, Nas, KRS-One and Rakim. In 1998, a re-recording of the single, performed by British dance act Bus Stop and which featured Douglas's vocals, peaked at number 8 in the ""UK Singles chart"". In October 1998, an article by Christina Lamb in London’s Daily Telegraph reported that some of the arrested Copts had undergone mock crucifixions and that Metropolitan Wissa faced possible execution. The Coptic Christians killed in this incident were considered martyrs of the Coptic Orthodox Church by Pope Shenouda III. In August 1998, in what is known as the First Kosheh Massacre, two Copts were murdered by Muslims. The Muslims in turn were allegedly seeking revenge for the “poisoning” of a brother who had actually died of natural causes. In response, the Egyptian police responded by rounding up about 1,200 Christians for investigation into the murder. The Egyptian government was outraged at the negative publicity, and arrested the head of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (ROHOH), whom it accused of having given the story to the Daily Telegraph. Although the government accused the police of human rights violations against the Copts in el-Kosheh, some police officers involved in the incident were eventually released. As a result, the incident turned into an international incident, and Coptic groups in the area were in fact promoted in international media. Most of the shopkeepers are Copts, while most of the farmers are Muslims from Arab tribes. The Second Kosheh Massacre took place about one year later, on Friday 31 December 1999. The incidence stemmed from a quarrel between a Christian merchant and a Muslim customer. The misunderstanding strained Muslim-Christian relations in the community. Relatives of the Muslim customer targeted Christian-owned shops and homes, which were looted, destroyed, and burned. Two days later on Sunday 2 January 2000, riots spread violence into neighbouring villages and lead to the murders of 20 Christians. One Muslim was also accidentally shot dead by a fellow Muslim. 260 shops, houses and kiosks were also deliberately burnt or damaged. Most of the killings took place in the outskirts of el-Kosheh, especially in the agriculture fields. This event was one of Egypt's bloodiest massacres. West began to push for the US Congress to include Egypt among nations that discriminate against Christians. The only person convicted in the massacre was a Muslim charged with accidental killing of another Muslim, and sentenced to 13 years in prison. The Coptic community felt that these events epitomised the criminal negligence of the Egyptian administration, represented in its police force, when it comes to protecting Coptic lives and property. Since local police units are often drawn from the local community, local feuds including Muslim resentment of Christian families can very well color police behaviour. The Pope of Alexandria Shenouda III rejected the verdict openly, and told reporters ""We want to challenge this ruling. We don't accept it."" No one was ever convicted for the murder of the 21 Christian victims. Six days following the acquittal of the defendants, the homes of four Christian families were set to fire and completely destroyed. One of the homeowners who reported the arson to the Egyptian police was tortured and forced to sign a statement prepared by a public prosecutor charging him with perpetrating the whole incident. He was subsequently forced to post bail for his own release. The word dolomite is also used to describe the sedimentary carbonate rock, which is composed predominantly of the mineral dolostone (also known as dolstone) (, ). In 1791, it was described as a rock by the French naturalist and geoloist Belsazar Hacquet as the ""stinking stone"" Dolomite is a double carbonate, having an alternating structural arrangement of calcium and magnesium ions. It forms white, tan, gray, or pink crystals. Small amounts of iron in the structure give the crystals a yellow to brown tint. The mineral is closely related to huntite Mg3Ca(CO3)4. Dolomite forms through a three-stage process: 1) A nanoparticulate magnesium-deficient, amorphous calcium carbonate forms; 2) After a temperature-dependent induction time, this Mg-ACC partially dehydrates and orders prior to its rapid crystallization to non-stoichiometric proto-dolomites; 3) Finally, the crystallization proceeds via a spherulitic growth mechanism that follows a novoation mechanism with a front row of nanocrystalline subunits that form aggregates that form spherical aggregates. It is often thought that dlomite will develop only with the help of sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g. Desulfovibrio brasiliensis) However, low-temperature dolmite may occur in natural environments rich in organic matter and microbial cell surfaces. This occurs as a result of magnesium complexation by carboxyl groups associated with organic matter. The general principle governing the course of this irreversible geochemical reaction has been coined ""breaking Ostwald's step rule"". There is some evidence for a biogenic occurrence of dolomITE in the urinary bladder of a Dalmatian dog, possibly as the result of an illness or infection. It has been found to occur under anaerobic conditions in supersaturated saline lagoons along the Rio de Janeiro coast of Brazil, namely, Lagoa Vermelha and Brejo do Espinho. In 2015, it was experimentally discovered that the direct crystallization of dalomite can occur from solution at temperatures between 60–220 °C. It was also found that the mineral can be dissolved by slightly acidic water, which is important as aquifers and contribute to karst terrain formation. It can be found in the old city of Rome, and later as samples collected in what is now known as the Dolomites Alps of northern Italy. It also occurs in the Alps of southern France, and in parts of northern England and northern Scotland. It occurs in a variety of shapes and sizes, including hexagonal, square, rectangular, and rectangular. The most common shape is the trigonal-rhombohedral system. Dolomite is used as an ornamental stone, a concrete aggregate, and a source of magnesium oxide. It is an important petroleum reservoir rock, and serves as the host rock for large strata-bound Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) ore deposits of base metals such as lead, zinc, and copper. The main house dates from 1806 with gothic embellishments and extensions added from the 1830s. The house is scheduled to open in 2016 as a study centre and will host group visits, writer's retreats, creative workshops, concerts and exhibitions. On the estate there are fourteen 4* self-catering cottages available all year round, a helicopter landing pad, a restaurant which caters to both guests and local residents, a 9-hole golf course, outdoor heated swimming pool, tennis court and children's play area. Some of the surrounding houses, particularly those in Middleton at the start of Moons Hill are connected with the Farringford's history, once forming part of the estate. The houses at the end of Queens Road, the junction near the farm used to be stables where Fred Pontin's horses where kept. The grounds are laid to lawn, rose borders and informal planting. Evidence remains of Tennyson's planting schemes together with a section of the walled garden and wooden footpaths.. Such a three-stage crystallization can explain microbially induced proto-dolomites observed in modern hypersaline settings. It may also be the route by which the Cryogenian cap dolomitic deposits of the Neoproterozoic formed. The only bus that goes down Bedbury Lane towards Alum Bay is the Needles Breezer Open Top bus, which has a stop outside the Farringsford. The estate is located on Bedbury lane, Freshwater Bay, on the Western tip of the Isle of Wight. It was the much loved home of Poet Laureate, Alfred Lord Tennyson, for forty years until his death in 1892. He moved to a stately home on a hill between Lurgashall and Haslemere in West Sussex in 1869. However, he returned to spend the winters in Farringfords in 1872. He wrote: ""Alyldworth found too many tourists who pestered him"" New Zealand is home to 3 million people and 60 million sheep. The population passed the 4 million mark in 2003. By 30 June 2015, the estimated resident population had reached 4.60 million people. There are currently 6.4 million dairy and 3.6 million beef cattle in New Zealand. In 1994, 43.2 percent of cattle were dairy cattle. By 2015, that proportion had increased to 64.0 percent. New Zealanders have also long been outnumbered by cattle, although not to the same extent as by sheep. It’s widely believed that New Zealand has 20 sheep for every person – information that adds weight to myriad sheep jokes. But contrary to popular belief there are actually about six sheep per person, not 20. As with New Zealand, this is due to declining sheep numbers and a growing human population. It's still twice as high as Australia's, for example, which currently has fewer than three sheep per person. The information on this page is now out of date.

Sabatier is the maker's mark used by several kitchen knife manufacturers. The name originated in Thiers, France at the beginning of the 19th century. The use of the Sabatier name is an anomaly of ""branding"" because the name was used by many different companies before intellectual property or trademark laws were fully established in France. In order to distinguish between the various makers, manufacturers are required to include a second word or symbol along with SABATIER. In 1979, after the sale of the Moutier Sab atier brands to Cuisinox, the various holders of the brands formed an association to protect the brand name. Most of these manufacturers use a ""fully forged"" and sharpening process using local skilled labour and a hand shaping and shaping technique. In this process, a single steel billet is heated where the bolster is shaped into a single cylinder. The entire piece is then heated again to create a bulge and forged to the shape of the blade, bolster, tang, and tang. After one operation, a sharpening tool is used to cut the forged piece to the final shape. Finally, the final shaping and handles are riveted and sharpened on the final piece of knife. The knife will then be sharpened and will be ready to be used in the kitchen.

Only knives manufactured in Thiers, France from well established manufacturers from the 19th century are considered ""genuine"" Sabatier knives. The alternative way to manufacture knives is stamping; forging has traditionally been considered superior, but from the late 20th century some knives of excellent quality have been produced by stamping. The following list is an attempt to link the present day owners to the brands. Many other manufacturers, both in France and elsewhere, use the Sab atier name on their knives; however, they are usually mass-produced, and of poor quality. Neither words such as vrai or garanti, nor ""Made in France"", ensure a good knife is made in France.Sabatier, Victorinox and Füritechnics are leading makers of Kitchen knives and cutlery.

Birdman of Alcatraz (film)
Birdman of Alcatraz is a 1962 film starring Burt Lancaster and directed by John Frankenheimer.   It is a largely fictionalized version of the life of Robert Stroud, a federal prison inmate known as the ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" because of his life with birds. In spite of the title, much of the action is set at Leavenworth Prison, where Stroud was jailed with his birds. When moved to Alcatraz he was not allowed to keep any pets. 

The film was adapted by Guy Trosper from the 1955 book by Thomas E. Gaddis. It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Burt Lancaster), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Telly Savalas), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Thelma Ritter) and Best Cinematography, Black-and-White. 

Plot

Robert Stroud (Lancaster) is imprisoned as a young man for committing a murder in Alaska. He is shown as a rebellious inmate, fighting against a rigid prison system: on his way to jail by train he breaks open the window to allow the suffocating inmates to breathe. His rebellious attitude puts him in conflict with Harvey Shoemaker (Malden), the warden of Leavenworth Prison.

While in jail, Stroud learns that his mother (Ritter) tried to visit him but was denied and told to return later in the week. Outraged, he attacks a guard over the issue and the man is killed. Stroud is sentenced to death, but his mother runs a successful campaign and it is commuted to life in prison. The terms of the sentence require that he be kept in solitary confinement for the rest of his life.

To break the monotony, Stroud adopts an orphaned baby sparrow as a pet. This starts a trend and he and the other convicts acquire birds, such as canaries, as gifts from the outside. Before long, Stroud has built up a collection of birds and cages. When they fall ill, he conducts experiments and comes up with a cure. As the years pass, Stroud becomes an expert on bird diseases and even publishes a book on the subject. His writings are so impressive that a doctor describes him as a ""genius"".

Stroud later meets bird-lover Stella Johnson (Field) and agrees to go into business, marketing his bird remedies. He and Stella later marry, but his mother disapproves and this causes a rift between mother and son. He is abruptly transferred to the federal penitentiary at Alcatraz (the ""Rock""), a new maximum security institution where he is not permitted to keep birds. He is now growing elderly but still shows a rebellious side, writing a history of the U.S. penal system that is suppressed by Shoemaker, now warden of the Rock.

Still at odds with authority, Stroud nevertheless manages to help stop a prison rebellion in 1946 by throwing out the guns acquired by the convicts. He then assures the authorities that they can now re-enter the premises without fear of being shot. Although Stroud has been a thorn in his side for decades, Shoemaker acknowledges that he has never lied to him and takes him at his word.

Although constantly denied parole, Stroud is eventually transferred to another prison in Missouri after a petition campaign. During the move, he meets several reporters and displays a range of knowledge on more than just birds, such as the technical details of a passing jet aircraft. He even gets to meet Thomas E. Gaddis (Edmond O'Brien), the author of the book based on his life.

Cast

* Burt Lancaster as Robert Stroud
* Karl Malden as Harvey Shoemaker
* Thelma Ritter as Elizabeth McCartney Stroud
* Neville Brand as Bull Ransom
* Betty Field as Stella Johnson
* Telly Savalas as Feto Gomez
* Edmond O'Brien as Thomas E. Gaddis
* Hugh Marlowe as Albert Comstock
* Whit Bissell as Dr. Ellis
* Crahan Denton as Kramer
* James Westerfield as Jess Younger

Production

This was to have been the American film debut for British director Charles Crichton until he clashed with Lancaster and was replaced by Frankenheimer.   According to Strother Martin, ""I had a nice role in Birdman of Alcatraz.  They fired the original director, Charles Crichton, and I went out with him.  I was replaced by Leo Penn who was eventually cut out of the picture entirely."" 

Reception

Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 82% of 17 surveyed critics, both contemporaneous and modern, gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7/10.   In discussing the film's prison setting, Variety wrote, ""Birdman reverses the formula and brings a new breadth and depth to the form.""  A. H. Weiler of The New York Times called it ""a thoughtful yet powerful portrait that cleaves to the heart and mind despite its omissions"".  According to those who knew him while he was in prison, the mild-mannered characterization of Stroud, as presented in Gaddis' book and the subsequent film, was largely fiction. Former inmate Glenn Williams went so far as to say that Stroud ""was not a sweetheart; he was a vicious killer. I think Burt Lancaster owes us all an apology"".  He and another former convict, Jim Quillan, described the real Stroud as a ""jerk"", ""a guy that liked chaos and turmoil and upheaval... Always at somebody else's expense"". They regarded the film as a ""comedy... an excellent comedy"". The film was placed at #76 on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Cheers.

Caipirinha
Caipirinha is Brazil's national cocktail, made with cachaça (sugarcane hard liquor), sugar and lime.  Cachaça,  also known as Pinga or Caninha, is Brazil's most common distilled alcoholic beverage. Although both rum and cachaça are made from sugarcane-derived products, in cachaça the alcohol results from the fermentation of fresh sugarcane juice that is then distilled, while rum is usually made from refinery by-products such as molasses. 

The drink is prepared by muddling the fruit and the sugar together, and adding the liquor. This can be made into a single glass, usually large, that can be shared amongst people, or into a larger jar, from where it is served in individual glasses.

History

Although the real origins of caipirinha, as it is known today, are unknown, according to one account it began around 1918 in the state of São Paulo with a popular recipe made with lime, garlic and honey, indicated for patients with the Spanish flu. Today it is still being used as a remedy for the common cold. As it was quite common to add some distilled spirits to home remedies, in order to expedite the therapeutic effect, rum was commonly used. ""Until one day someone decided to remove the garlic and honey. Then added a few tablespoons sugar to reduce the acidity of lime. The ice came next, to ward off the heat,"" explains Carlos Lima, executive director of IBRAC (Brazilian Institute of Cachaça).  

The caipirinha is the strongest national cocktail of Brazil  and is imbibed in restaurants, bars, and many households throughout the country. Once almost unknown outside Brazil, the drink has become more popular and more widely available in recent years, in large part due to the rising availability of first-rate brands of cachaça outside Brazil.  The International Bartenders Association has designated it as one of their Official Cocktails.

Name

The word caipirinha is the diminutive of the word caipira, which in Brazilian Portuguese refers to someone from the countryside (specifically, someone from the rural parts of south-central Brazil), being similar to US English hillbilly or the Lowland Scots teuchter. Caipira is a two-gender noun. The diminutive mostly refers to the drink in which case it is a feminine noun.

Variations

*Although Brazilian law (Decree 6.871  based on Normative Ruling 55, from Oct. 31, 2008)  as well as the International Bartenders Association (IBA)  allow the use of the name caipirinha for the version with lime only, the term is often used to describe any cachaça-and-fruit-juice drink with the fruit's name (e.g. a passionfruit caipirinha, kiwifruit caipirinha or strawberry caipirinha).
*Caipifruta is a very popular caipirinha drink in Brazil, consisting of cachaça, crushed fresh fruits (either singly or in combination), and crushed ice.  The most popular fresh fruits used to create caipifrutas are tangerine, lime, kiwifruit, passion fruit, pineapple, lemon, grapes, mango, cajá (Spondias mombin fruit), and caju (cashew fruit).

Derivations

There are many derivations of caipirinha in which other spirits substitute for cachaça. Some include:

*The Caipivodka (also known as Caipiroska, Caipiroshka or Caipirovka), in which vodka substitutes for cachaça. Very popular in Finland and Sweden. In Africa this version is also called ""Dawa"", Swahili for medicine.
*The Caipiroska Negra, Black Caipiroshka or Caipiblack is made with black vodka instead of cachaça.
*Caipiríssima is a caipirinha made with rum instead of cachaça; the word was coined for an advertisement for a popular rum brand in the late '70s.
*Caipinheger is another variation made using Steinhäger.  
*Caipirão is another Portuguese variation made using Licor Beirão instead of cachaça. Beirão liquor is very sweet, so no sugar is used. 
*Caipisake (also called Sakeirinha) is made with sake instead of cachaça. Often made with strawberries or kiwifruit.  
*A variation from Italy is made using Campari instead of cachaça.
Question:
The drink Caipirinha is the national cocktail of which South American country?

Brazil

Cosmicomics
Cosmicomics is a collection of twelve short stories by Italo Calvino first published in Italian in 1965 and in English in 1968. The stories were originally published between 1964 and 1965 in the Italian periodicals Il Caffè and Il Giorno. Each story takes a scientific ""fact"" (though sometimes a falsehood by today's understanding), and builds an imaginative story around it.  An always extant being called Qfwfq narrates all of the stories save two, each of which is a memory of an event in the history of the universe. Qfwfq also narrates some stories in Calvino's t zero.

All of the stories in Cosmicomics, together with those from t zero and other sources, are now available in a single volume collection, The Complete Cosmicomics (Penguin UK, 2009).

The first U.S. edition, translated by William Weaver, won the National Book Award in the Translation category.
[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1969.html ""National Book Awards – 1969""]. National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-11.There was a ""Translation"" award from 1967 to 1983.

Contents

*The Distance of the Moon, the first and probably the best known story. Calvino takes the fact that the Moon used to be much closer to the Earth, and builds a story about a love triangle among people who used to jump between the Earth and the Moon, in which lovers drift apart as the Moon recedes.
*At Daybreak — Life before matter condenses.
*A Sign in Space — The idea that the galaxy slowly revolves becomes a story about a being who is desperate to leave behind some unique sign of his existence.  This story also is a direct illustration of one of the tenets of postmodern theory — that the sign is not the thing it signifies, nor can one claim to fully or properly describe a thing or an idea with a word or other symbol.
*All at One Point — The fact that all matter and creation used to exist in a single point.  ""Naturally, we were all there—old Qfwfq said—where else could we have been? Nobody knew then that there could be space. Or time either: what use did we have for time, packed in there like sardines?""
*Without Colors — Before there was an atmosphere, everything was the same shade of gray. As the atmosphere appears, so do colors. The novelty scares off Ayl, Qfwfq's love interest.
*Games Without End — A galactic game of marbles back before the universe had formed much more than particles.
*The Aquatic Uncle — A tale on the fact that at one stage in evolution animals left the sea and came to live on land.  The story is about a family living on land that is a bit ashamed of their old uncle who still lives in the sea, refusing to come ashore like ""civilized"" people.
*How Much Shall We Bet — A story about betting on the long term evolution of mankind.
*The Dinosaurs — How some dinosaurs lived after most of them had become extinct, and how it felt to be that last existing dinosaur in an age where all the current mammals feared his kind as demons.
*The Form of Space — As the unnamed narrator ""falls"" through space, he cannot help but notice that his trajectory is parallel to that of a beautiful woman, Ursula H'x, and that of lieutenant Fenimore, who is also in love with Ursula. The narrator dreams of the shape of space changing, so that he may touch Ursula (or fight with Fenimore).
*The Light Years — The unnamed narrator looking at other galaxies, and spotting one with a sign pointed right at him saying ""I saw you.""  Given that there's a gulf of 100,000,000 light years, he checks his diary to find out what he had been doing that day, and finds out that it was something he wished to hide.  Then he starts to worry.
*The Spiral — A story about life as a mollusc, and the nature of love and writing.

All of the stories feature non-human characters which have been heavily anthropomorphized.

"Passage:
Zadok the Priest
The four anthems The King Shall Rejoice, My Heart is Inditing, Let thy Hand be Strengthened, and Zadok the Priest were composed by George Frideric Handel for the coronation of King George II in 1727, and are thus known as the Coronation Anthems. Zadok the Priest has been sung during the anointing of the sovereign at every Coronation of the British monarch since 1727.

Text

Part of the traditional content of British coronations, the texts for all four anthems were picked by Handel—a personal selection from the most accessible account of an earlier coronation, that of James II in 1685.  The text is a translation of the traditional antiphon, Unxerunt Salomonem,  itself derived from the biblical account of the anointing of Solomon. These words have been used in every English, and later British, coronation since that of King Edgar at Bath Abbey in 973. An earlier setting had been written by Henry Lawes for the coronation of King Charles II. 

At the coronation itself on 11 October 1727, the choir of Westminster Abbey sang Zadok the Priest in the wrong part of the service; they had earlier entirely forgotten to sing one anthem and another ended ""in confusion"". 

Full text

After 1 Kings 1:38–40

Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet anointed Solomon King.
And all the people rejoiced, and said:
God save the King! Long live the King!
May the King live for ever,
Amen, Allelujah.

Structure

Zadok the Priest is written for SS-AA-T-BB chorus and orchestra (two oboes, two bassoons, three trumpets, timpani, strings (with three violin parts rather than the usual two), continuo). The music prepares a surprise in its orchestral introduction through the use of static layering of soft string textures followed by a sudden rousing forte tutti entrance, augmented by three trumpets.

The middle section ""And all the people rejoic'd, and said"" is an imitatory dance in 3/4 time, with the choir singing chordally and a dotted rhythm in the strings.

The final section ""God save the King"", etc. is a return to common time (4/4), with the ""God save the King"" section heard chordally, interspersed with the Amens incorporating long semiquaver runs, taken in turn through the six voice parts (SAATBB) with the other parts singing quaver chords accompanying it. The chorus ends with a largo plagal cadence on ""Allelujah"".

Other uses

* It is regularly (sometimes daily) played by request on 'popular classics' radio stations in the United Kingdom such as Classic FM, which aired this song at its launch at 6am on 7 September 1992.
* Used in royal weddings, including that of Mary Elizabeth Donaldson to Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark. 
*Used in a 2015 commercial for DirectTV advertising a partnership with AT&T to watch TV on mobile phones. 
* Furthermore Tony Britten rearranged Zadok the Priest in 1992. Since then this rearrangement is the official anthem of the UEFA Champions League.

The Phoenix Mythical Bird
The Phoenix lives a long life, and then is consumed by flames, only to immediately rise again from the ashes. This mythical bird is surrounded by folklore and legend. Read on to know about this legendary fictitious bird.
By Mansi Chitranshi | Saturday, February 14, 2009
Phoenix - To Burn Itself and Rise Again From Its Ashes
The phoenix bird is a symbol of immortality, rebirth and afterlife. In earliest Greek and Egyptian mythology, it is linked with the sun god. As per the Greeks, Phoenix resides in Arabia, close to a cold well. Each sunrise at dawn, the sun god would stop his chariot to listen to the bird sing a melodious song while it bathed in the well.
Only one phoenix exists at a time. When the bird felt its death was near, every 500 to 1,461 years, it would build a nest of aromatic wood and set it on fire. The bird then was consumed by the flames.
Legend
The phoenix, germinating in the legends of ancient Egypt, has become a common emblem of reincarnation and the most legendary of all magnificent birds. Covered with red and gold feathers, it carries the color of the rising sun; it had a harmonious voice that became despondent with impending bereavement. Other mortals were then so surmounted by its beauty and melancholy that they themselves fell dead.
The prodigy surrounding the Phoenix bird has myriad variants, with some of the most primitive accounts dating back to 8 centuries before the Christ was born. It is said that if the Phoenix is wounded, it can cure itself and enjoy a long life span.
When the Phoenix gets close to the termination of its life, it's believed to build itself a nest of fragrant spices such as cinnamon and myrrh. It then sets the nest and itself on fire and is burned to ashes. Soon after, the Phoenix rises again and starts its life anew. In some customs, the new Phoenix collects the ashes of the old and takes them to Heliopolis to present them to the Sun God.
Portrayal - What a Phoenix Looks Like
Phoenix, as described by appearance, has the dimension of an eagle, with gold plumage around the neck, an amethyst body, and a sapphire tail. The throat has a crown, and the head has a clump of feathers.
Traits - Some Attributes
The main characteristic of the phoenix is that it is reborn through fire: when it gets aged it will make a nest and put it on fire. The phoenix will envelop in the flames, but will take another life out of the ashes.  There can be only one Phoenix at a time; its life extends for many years (accounts vary from 500, 540, 1000 or 1460 years.) No one has ever seen this bird devour.  This myth was very widespread among the Egyptians, the Greek, oriental cultures, and during ancient period.
The Phoenix Re-emerges
Phoenix, as they believe, is the only bird competent of restoring and reproducing its own life form. Contrasting to other birds, the Phoenix does not nourish on seeds, but on the gum of frankincense (a pungent resin) and the juices of amomum (an herb of the ginger family)
Phoenix represents
Phoenix is said to represent the sun, which dies ach night and take a new birth every morning. Some traditional writers also relate it with ""existing in heaven"", enjoying everlasting adolescence. Amid Christians, it signifies reincarnation.
Also Referred to As
Also called Feng-Huang- (Chinese adaptation) in this translation, the bird is sent to the world to execute astonishing tasks and to assist the development of mankind. It emerges in diverse phases of the earth's evolution, and then proceeds to heaven.

Passage:
Connective tissue
Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four types of biological tissue that support, connect, or separate different types of tissues and organs in the body. It develops from the mesoderm. The other three types are epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and  spinal cord are composed of connective tissue.

All connective tissue apart from blood and lymph consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers),  ground substance and cells. (Not all authorities include blood  or lymph as connective tissue.) Blood and lymph lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.

The cells of connective tissue include fibroblasts, adipocytes, macrophages, mast cells and leucocytes.

Structure

Connective tissue can be broadly subdivided into connective tissue proper, and special connective tissue.  Connective tissue proper consists of loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue (which is further subdivided into dense regular and dense irregular connective tissues.)  Special connective tissue consists of reticular connective tissue, adipose tissue, cartilage, bone, and blood.  Other kinds of connective tissues include fibrous, elastic, and lymphoid connective tissues.  New vascularised connective tissue that forms in the process of wound healing is termed granulation tissue. 
Fibroblasts are the cells responsible for the production of some CT.

Type I collagen, is present in many forms of connective tissue, and makes up about 25% of the total protein content of the mammalian body. 

Characteristics

Characteristics of CT:
* Cells are spread through an extracellular fluid. 
* Ground substance - A clear, colorless, and viscous fluid containing glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans to fix the body water and the collagen fibers in the intercellular spaces. Ground substance slows the spread of pathogens.
* Fibers. Not all types of CT are fibrous. Examples of non-fibrous CT include adipose tissue and blood. Adipose tissue gives ""mechanical cushioning"" to the body, among other functions.   Although there is no dense collagen network in adipose tissue, groups of adipose cells are kept together by collagen fibers and collagen sheets in order to keep fat tissue under compression in place (for example, the sole of the foot). The matrix of blood is plasma. 
* Both the ground substance and proteins (fibers) create the matrix for CT.

Function

Connective tissue has a wide variety of functions that depend on the types of cells and the different classes of fibers involved. Loose and dense irregular connective tissue, formed mainly by fibroblasts and collagen fibers, have an important role in providing a medium for oxygen and nutrients to diffuse from capillaries to cells, and carbon dioxide and waste substances to diffuse from cells back into circulation. They also allow organs to resist stretching and tearing forces. Dense regular connective tissue, which forms organized structures, is a major functional component of tendons, ligaments and aponeuroses, and is also found in highly specialized organs such as the cornea. Elastic fibers, made from elastin and fibrillin, also provide resistance to stretch forces. They are found in the walls of large blood vessels and in certain ligaments, particularly in the ligamenta flava.

In hematopoietic and lymphatic tissues, reticular fibers made by reticular cells provide the stroma—or structural support—for the parenchyma—or functional part—of the organ.

Mesenchyme is a type of connective tissue found in developing organs of embryos that is capable of differentiation into all types of mature connective tissue. Another type of relatively undifferentiated connective tissue is mucous connective tissue, found inside the umbilical cord.

Various type of specialized tissues and cells are classified under the spectrum of connective tissue, and are as diverse as brown and white adipose tissue, blood, cartilage and bone. Cells of the immune system, such as macrophages, mast cells, plasma cells and eosinophils are found scattered in loose connective tissue, providing the ground for starting inflammatory and immune responses upon the detection of antigens.

Clinical significance

It is estimated that 1 in 10 people have a connective tissue disorder.  Diseases of connective tissue include:

*Connective tissue neoplasms including sarcomas such as hemangiopericytoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in nervous tissue.
*Congenital diseases include Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.
*Myxomatous degeneration – a pathological weakening of connective tissue.
*Mixed connective tissue disease – a disease of the autoimmune system, also undifferentiated connective tissue disease.
*Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) – a major autoimmune disease of connective tissue
*Scurvy, caused by a deficiency of vitamin C which is necessary for the synthesis of collagen.

Staining of connective tissue

For microscopic viewing, most of the connective tissue staining-techniques, color tissue fibers in contrasting shades. Collagen may be differentially stained by any of the following:

* Van Gieson's stain
* Masson's trichrome stain
* Mallory's trichrome stain
* Aniline blue stain
* Eosin
* Reticulin stain

Passage:
Roundhead
Roundhead was the name given to the supporters of the Parliament of England during the English Civil War. Also known as Parliamentarians, they fought against Charles I of England and his supporters, the Cavaliers or Royalists, who claimed rule by absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings.  The goal of the Roundhead party was to give the Parliament supreme control over executive administration.

Most Roundheads appear to have sought a constitutional monarchy in place of the absolutist monarchy sought by Charles I. However, at the end of the English Civil War in 1649, public antipathy towards the king was high enough to allow republican leaders such as Oliver Cromwell to abolish the monarchy completely and establish the Commonwealth of England.

The Roundhead commander-in-chief of the first Civil War, Thomas Fairfax, remained a supporter of constitutional monarchy, as did many other Roundhead leaders such as Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester and Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex; however, this party was outmanoeuvred by the more politically-adept Cromwell and his radicals, who had the backing of the New Model Army and took advantage of Charles' perceived betrayal of England by allying with the Scottish against Parliament.

England's many Puritans and Presbyterians were almost invariably Roundhead supporters, as were many smaller religious groups such as the Independents. However many Roundheads were Church of England, as were many Cavaliers.

Roundhead political factions included the proto-anarchist Diggers, the diverse group known as the Levellers and the apocalyptic Christian movement of the Fifth Monarchists.

Origins and background

Some Puritans, but by no means all, wore their hair closely cropped round the head or flat and there was thus an obvious contrast between them and the men of courtly fashion, who wore long ringlets.

During the war and for a time afterwards, Roundhead was a term of derision—in the New Model Army it was a punishable offence to call a fellow soldier a Roundhead. This contrasted with the term ""Cavalier"" to describe supporters of the Royalist cause. Cavalier also started out as a pejorative term—the first proponents used it to compare members of the Royalist party with Spanish Caballeros who had abused Dutch Protestants during the reign of Elizabeth I—but unlike Roundhead, Cavalier was embraced by those who were the target of the epithet and used by them to describe themselves.

""Roundheads"" appears to have been first used as a term of derision toward the end of 1641, when the debates in Parliament in the Clergy Act 1640 were causing riots at Westminster. The Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition quotes a contemporary authority's description of the crowd gathered there: ""They had the hair of their heads very few of them longer than their ears, whereupon it came to pass that those who usually with their cries attended at Westminster were by a nickname called Roundheads"". The demonstrators included London apprentices and Roundhead was a term of derision for them because the regulations to which they had agreed included a provision for closely cropped hair.

According to John Rushworth the word was first used on 27 December 1641 by a disbanded officer named David Hide, who during a riot is reported to have drawn his sword and said he would ""cut the throat of those round-headed dogs that bawled against bishops"". 

However, Richard Baxter ascribes the origin of the term to a remark made by Queen Henrietta Maria of France at the trial of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, earlier that year. Referring to John Pym, she asked who the roundheaded man was. The principal advisor to Charles II, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, remarked on the matter, ""and from those contestations the two terms of Roundhead and Cavalier grew to be received in discourse, ... they who were looked upon as servants to the king being then called Cavaliers, and the other of the rabble contemned and despised under the name of Roundheads."" 

Ironically, after Anglican Archbishop William Laud made a statute in 1636 instructing all clergy to wear short hair, many Puritans rebelled to show their contempt for his authority and began to grow their hair even longer (as can be seen on their portraits)   though they continued to be known as Roundheads. The longer hair was more common among the ""Independent"" and ""high ranking"" Puritans (which included Cromwell), especially toward the end of the Protectorate, while the ""Presbyterian"" (i.e. non-Independent) faction, and the military rank-and-file, continued to abhor long hair. By the end of this period some Independent Puritans were again derisively using the term Roundhead to refer to the Presbyterian Puritans.

Roundhead remained in use to describe those with republican tendencies up until the Exclusion Crisis of 1678–1681; the term was then superseded by ""Whig"", initially another term with pejorative connotations. Likewise during the Exclusion Bill crisis, the term Cavalier was replaced with ""Tory"", an Irish term introduced by their opponents, and also initially a pejorative term.

Passage:
John T. Scopes
John Thomas Scopes (August 3, 1900 – October 21, 1970) was a teacher in  Dayton, Tennessee, who was charged on May 5, 1925 for violating Tennessee's Butler Act, which prohibited the teaching of evolution in Tennessee schools. He was tried in a case known as the Scopes Trial, in which he was found guilty and fined $100.

Biography

Scopes was born in 1900 on a farm in Paducah, Kentucky where he was reared before moving to Danville, Illinois as a teenager. In 1917 he moved to Salem, Illinois where he was a member of the class of 1919 at Salem High School.  He attended the University of Illinois for a short time before leaving for health reasons.  He earned a degree at the University of Kentucky in 1924, with a major in law and a minor in geology.  Scopes moved to Dayton where he took a job as the Rhea County High School's football coach and occasionally filled in as substitute teacher when regular members of the staff were off work. 

Scopes's involvement in the so-called Scopes Monkey Trial came about after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced that it would finance a test case challenging the constitutionality of the Butler Act if they could find a Tennessee teacher willing to act as a defendant.

A band of businessmen in Dayton, Tennessee, led by engineer and geologist George Rappleyea, saw this as an opportunity to get publicity for their town and approached Scopes. Rappleyea pointed out that while the Butler Act prohibited the teaching of human evolution, the state required teachers to use the assigned textbook, Hunter's Civic Biology (1914), which included a chapter on evolution. Rappleyea argued that teachers were essentially required to break the law. When asked about the test case, Scopes was initially reluctant to get involved, but after some discussion he told the group gathered in Robinson's Drugstore, ""If you can prove that I've taught evolution and that I can qualify as a defendant, then I'll be willing to stand trial."" 

By the time the trial had begun, the defense team included  Clarence Darrow, Dudley Field Malone, John Neal, Arthur Garfield Hays and Frank McElwee. The prosecution team, led by Tom Stewart, included brothers Herbert Hicks and Sue K. Hicks, Wallace Haggard, father and son pairings Ben and J. Gordon McKenzie, and William Jennings Bryan and William Jennings Bryan Jr. Bryan had spoken at Scopes's high school commencement and remembered the defendant laughing while he was giving the address to the graduating class six years earlier.

The case ended on July 21, 1925, with a guilty verdict, and Scopes was fined 100 dollars.  The case was appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court.  In a 3-1 decision written by Chief Justice Grafton Green the Butler Act was held to be constitutional, but the court overturned Scopes's conviction on a technicality: the judge had set the fine instead of the jury. The Butler Act remained until May 18, 1967, when it was repealed by the Tennessee legislature.

Scopes may have actually been innocent of the crime to which his name is inexorably linked.  After the trial Scopes admitted to reporter William Kinsey Hutchinson ""I didn't violate the law,"" (DeCamp p. 435) explaining that he had skipped the evolution lesson, and that his lawyers had coached his students to go on the stand; the Dayton businessmen had assumed he had violated the law.  Hutchinson did not file his story until after the Scopes appeal was decided in 1927.

After the trial Scopes accepted a scholarship for graduate study in geology at the University of Chicago. He then did geological field work in Venezuela for Gulf Oil of South America. There he met and married his wife, Mildred, and was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church. In 1930, he returned to the University of Chicago for a third year of graduate study. After two years without professional employment, he took a position as a geologist with the United Gas Corporation, for which he studied oil reserves. He worked, in Houston, Texas then in Shreveport, Louisiana, until he retired in 1963. 

He died on October 21, 1970 in Shreveport, Louisiana at the age of 70.

Woodwind instrument
Woodwind instruments  are a family of musical instruments within the more general category of wind instruments.  There are two main types of woodwind instruments:  flutes and reed instruments (otherwise called reed pipes). What differentiates these instruments from other wind instruments is the way in which they produce their sound.  Examples are a saxophone, a bassoon, piccolo and others.

Flutes

Flutes produce sound by directing a focused stream of air across the edge of a hole in a cylindrical tube.  The flute family can be divided into two sub-families: open flutes, and closed flutes. 

To produce a sound with open flutes, the player is required to blow a stream of air across a sharp edge that then splits the airstream .  This split airstream then acts upon the air column contained within the flute's hollow causing it to vibrate and produce sound.  Examples of open flutes are the transverse flute, panpipes and ocarinas.  Ancient flutes of this variety were often made from tubular sections of plants such as grasses, reeds, and hollowed-out tree branches. Later, flutes were made of metals such as tin, copper, or bronze. Modern concert flutes are usually made of high-grade metal alloys, usually containing nickel, silver, copper, or gold. 

To produce a sound with a closed flute, the player is required to blow air into a duct.  This duct acts as a channel bringing the air to a sharp edge.  As with the open flutes, the air is then split; this causes the column of air within the closed flute to vibrate and produce sound.  Examples of this type of flute include the recorder, and organ pipes. 

Reed instruments

Reed instruments produce sound by focusing air into a mouthpiece which then causes a reed, or reeds, to vibrate.  Similar to flutes, Reed pipes are also further divided into two types: single reed and double reed.   

Single-reed woodwinds produce sound by placing a reed onto the opening of a mouthpiece (using a ligature).  When air is forced between the reed and the mouthpiece, the reed causes the air column in the instrument to vibrate and produce its unique sound. Single reed instruments include the clarinet, saxophone, and others such as the chalumeau.  

Double-reed instruments use two precisely cut, small pieces of cane bound together at the base.  This form of sound production has been estimated to have originated in the middle to late Neolithic period; its discovery has been attributed to the observation of wind blowing through a split rush.   The finished, bound reed is inserted into the instrument and vibrates as air is forced between the two pieces (again, causing the air within the instrument to vibrate as well).   This family of reed pipes is subdivided further into another two sub-families: exposed double reed, and capped double reed instruments. 
 
Exposed double-reed instruments are played by having the double reed directly between the player's lips.  This family includes instruments such as the oboe, cor anglais (also called English horn) and bassoon, and many types of shawms throughout the world.

On the other hand, Capped double-reed instruments have the double reed covered by a cap.  The player  blows through a hole in this cap that then directs the air through the reeds. This family includes the crumhorn.

Bagpipes are unique reed pipe instruments since they use two or more double or single reeds.  However, bagpipes are functionally the same as a capped double reed instruments since the reeds are never in direct contact with player's lips. 

Free reed aerophone instruments are likewise unique since sound is produced by 'free reeds' –  small metal tongues arranged in rows within a metal or wooden frame.  The airflow necessary for the instruments sound is generated either by a players breath (e.g. harmonica), or by bellows (e.g. accordion).  

Modern orchestra and concert band woodwinds 

The modern orchestra's woodwind section typically includes: flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons. The piccolo, cor anglais, bass clarinet, and contrabassoon are commonly used supplementary woodwind instruments. The section may also on occasion be expanded by the addition of saxophone(s).

The concert band's woodwind section is typically much larger and more diverse than the orchestra's. The concert band's woodwind section typically includes: piccolo, flutes, oboes, B clarinets, bass clarinets, bassoons, alto saxophones, tenor saxophone, and baritone saxophone. The cor anglais, E clarinet, alto clarinet, contra-alto clarinet, contrabass clarinet, contrabassoon, and soprano saxophone are also used, but not as frequently as the other woodwinds.

Paul Bäumer
This article deals with Paul Bäumer the pilot. For the fictional Paul Bäumer, see All Quiet on the Western Front. For the late member of electronic music group Bingo Players, see Bingo Players

Paul Wilhelm Bäumer (11 May 1896 – 15 July 1927) was a German fighter ace in World War I.

Background

Bäumer was born on 11 May 1896 in Duisburg, Germany. He was a dental assistant before World War I, and earned a private pilot's license by Summer 1914.Franks et al 1993, pp. 66–67.

Involvement in The Civil War

At the start of the war, he joined the 70th Infantry Regiment. He served in both France and Russia, being wounded in the arm in the latter. He then transferred to the air service as a dental assistant before being accepted for military pilot training.

By October 1916, he was serving as a ferry pilot and instructor at Armee Flugpark 1. On 19 February 1917, he was promoted to Gefreiter. On 26 March, he was assigned to Flieger Abteilung 7; he was promoted to Unteroffizier on the 29th.

On 15 May 1917, he was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class. He subsequently received training on single-seaters, consequently being posted to fighter duty. Bäumer joined Jagdstaffel 5 on 30 June 1917, scoring three victories as a balloon buster in mid-July before going to the elite Jasta Boelcke.

Bäumer claimed heavily, reaching 18 victories by year end.  He was commissioned in April 1918. On 29 May Bäumer was injured in a crash, breaking his jaw, and he returned to the Jasta in September. With the arrival of the Fokker D.VII he claimed even more success, including 16 in September. Nicknamed ""The Iron Eagle"", he flew with a personal emblem of an Edelweiss on his aircraft. He was one of the few pilots in World War I whose lives were saved by parachute deployment, when he was shot down in flames in September. He received the Pour le Mérite shortly before the Armistice and was finally credited with 43 victories, ranking ninth among German aces.

Post-War Career

After the war, Bäumer worked briefly in the dockyards before he became a dentist, and reportedly one of his patients, Erich Maria Remarque, used Bäumer's name for the protagonist of his antiwar novel All Quiet on the Western Front.

Continuing his interest in flying, he founded his own aircraft company in Hamburg. Bäumer died in an air crash at Copenhagen on 15 July 1927, age 31, while test flying a Rohrbach Ro IX fighter.

Passage:
Cassandra Trotter
Cassandra Louise Trotter (née Parry; born 16 June 1966 ) is a fictional character from the British sitcom Only Fools and Horses. She was portrayed by Gwyneth Strong.

Biography

The intelligent, slightly-spoiled daughter of the owner of a successful paper merchant, Alan (Denis Lill) and his wife Pam (Wanda Ventham), Cassandra was an ambitious employee of the local bank. She made her first Only Fools and Horses appearance in the episode Yuppy Love, in which she was an attendee of Rodney's adult education class. The two first met when they accidentally mixed up their raincoats in the cloak room, and met again at a disco later that night, at which Rodney's friends Mickey Pearce and Jevon unsuccessfully ask her for a dance. Rodney then bet £20 that he would be successful and, to their horror, she agreed to dance with him. Cassandra also offered to give him a lift home, and they exchanged telephone numbers. However, as he was ashamed to take her home to Nelson Mandela House, he pretended he lived in a more upmarket location on King's Avenue and was duly left stranded as it began to pour with rain, again getting their coats mixed up leaving Rodney to walk home.

Originally John Sullivan wanted to make Cassandra a girlfriend of Trigger, Denzil or an admirer of Boycie, but decided that like he planned to do with Del, Rodney needed a long term relationship.

Their relationship blossomed throughout the sixth series; In The Unlucky Winner Is... she went to Spain with Rodney and Del, and had to pretend to be Del's wife, and Rodney's stepmother. In Sickness and Wealth, Rodney announced that they were engaged; they married in the final episode of series 6: Little Problems, after which they moved into their own flat. Her marriage to Rodney was not without its problems; Rodney was envious of Cassandra's privileged upbringing and her qualifications. When Cassandra wanted to build herself a career at the bank, Rodney was outraged, as he wanted her to be little more than a housewife, and have his dinner on the table for when he got home from work.

After a year of being married she and Rodney split up in The Jolly Boys Outing (the 1989 Christmas special), when he punched her boss and broke his nose. In the next episode aired Rodney Come Home (Christmas special 1990), they broke up again, which started an ongoing split between the pair. This split carried on throughout the duration of series 7. In The Chance of a Lunchtime Del played matchmaker between the two, reuniting them. However, the two were only together for an hour before Cassandra saw Rodney with an ex-fiancē of Del Boy's. Assuming that Rodney was cheating on her, Cassandra locked him out of the flat. They were ultimately reconciled in Three Men, a Woman and a Baby but after just getting back together they were interrupted by a phone call that Raquel had gone into labour and Del wanted Rodney to be there for the birth. The episode Miami Twice saw them trying to patch up their relationship, and in Mother Natures Son they were back together properly, and stayed together ever since. The later episodes saw them attempting to conceive a child, and Cassandra was promoted to head of small business investment at the local bank. After suffering a miscarriage in ""Modern Men"", she and Rodney later had a daughter, Joan (named after Del and Rodney's late mother), in Sleepless in Peckham.

When the bird felt its death was near, every 500 to 1,461 years, it would build a nest of aromatic wood and set it on fire. The bird then was consumed by the flames. This myth was very widespread among the Egyptians, the Greek, oriental cultures, and during ancient period. The Phoenix is said to represent the sun, which dies ach night and take a new birth every morning. Some traditional writers also relate it with ""existing in heaven"", enjoying everlasting adolescence. In some customs, the new Phoenix collects the ashes of the old and takes them to Heliopolis to present them to the Sun God. The main characteristic of the phoenix is that it is reborn through fire: when it gets aged it will make a nest and put it onFire. The phoenix will envelop in the flames, but will take another life out of the ashes,  there can be only one Phoenix at a time. No one has ever seen this bird devour. It is the only bird competent of restoring and reproducing its own life form. Contrasting to other birds, the Phoenix does not nourish on seeds, but on the gum of frankincense (a pungent resin) and the juices of amomum (an herb of the ginger family) The bird is sent to the world to execute astonishing tasks and to assist the development of mankind. It emerges in diverse phases of the earth's evolution,. and then proceeds to heaven. It has the dimension of an eagle, with gold plumage around the neck, an amethyst body, and a sapphire tail. The throat has a crown, and the head has a clump of feathers. It develops the mesoderm, epithelial, muscle, nervous tissue, and nervous tissue in the human body. It also has the capacity to cure itself and enjoy a long. life span. If the Phoenix is wounded, it can cure itself, and it can survive for many years. It can be found in the book ""The Phoenix Mythical Bird"" by Mansi Chitranshi, published by Oxford University Press, priced £9.99. nective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. All connective tissue apart from blood and lymph consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers),  ground substance and cells. Connective tissue has a wide variety of functions that depend on the types of cells and the different classes of fibers involved. Not all types of CT are fibrous. Examples of non-fibrous CT include adipose tissue and blood. Adipose tissue gives ""mechanical cushioning"" to the body. Although there is no dense collagen network in adipose. tissue, groups of adipose cells are kept together by collagen fibers and. collagen sheets in order to keep fat tissue under compression in place (for example, the sole of the foot). The matrix of blood is plasma. The cells of connective. tissue include fibroblasts, adipocytes, macrophages, mast cells and leucocytes. Cells of the immune system, such as macrophage. mast cells, eosinophils and eosophils are found scattered in loose c.m.Cells. are found in the walls of large blood vessels and in certain ligaments, particularly in the ligamenta flava. They provide a medium for oxygen and nutrients to diffuse from capillaries to cells, and carbon dioxide and waste substances to diffuse. from cells back into circulation. They also allow organs to resist stretching and tearing forces. Different types of specialized tissues and cells are classified under the spectrum of connectives tissue, and are as diverse as brown and white adipose tissues, blood, cartilage and bone. Another type of relatively undifferentiated connective tissues is mucous connective flesh, found inside the umbilical cord. It is a type of connectIVE tissue found in developing organs of embryos that is capable of differentiation into all types. of mature connective cells. It can also be found in highly specialized organs such as the cornea. It's a major functional component of tendons, ligaments and aponeuroses, and is also found in very specialized organs like the stomach.

The singer created Dollywood 20 years ago in Pidgeon Ford, Tennessee, to help rejuvinate the area and it is now the main employer in the county. The Jolene singer has the most famous cleavage in the world, but turned down numerous offers to pose topless for Playboy. The Rocky Horror Picture Show holds the record for using the highest number of extras in a scene. Dolly has been married to Carl Dean since 1966 and says she would never cheat on her husband. She once said of herself, """"It takes a lot of money to look as cheap as this"" ""I have motion sickness. I could never ride some of these rides. I used to get sick on the school bus,"" she said of Dollywood's rides. ""I just don't feel like I have to explain myself. I love everybody,"" Parton said in a recent interview. ""You know they always talk about two rooms and a bath?"" Parton once said. ""We’d have running water when we”d run to get it. We didn’t have any electricity. If fireflies were out, we’'d catch them in a mason jar and put them in our bedroom."" ""I’ve never met the man that would take his place,"" the singer said of her husband Carl Dean. ""My husband knows I’m a flirt and a tease but it’s harmless,” she said. “I�’ll never cheat.” ""Which singer once said...?"" asked a fan. ""Floyd Parton,"" she replied. ""That's what I like to call him. He's a good guy."" ""What do you think?"" asked another. ""He's a great guy,"" said Parton. ""What's his name?"" she asked. ""Dolly Parton."" ""Dollie."" ""Yes, Dolly, what's your name?"" said the fan.""Dolly, Dollie, what do you call yourself?"" she said, ""I'm the queen of Country music"" ""Dollsie"" is the name of Parton's daughter. ""She's a country music queen,"" said a friend. ""And I'm a country singer, too"" said a fellow country music star. ""But I'm in business. I don't like to talk about it."" ""You're a country girl, too,"" said another. Roundhead was the name given to the supporters of the Parliament of England during the English Civil War. Also known as Parliamentarians, they fought against Charles I of England and his supporters, the Cavaliers or Royalists. The goal of the Roundhead party was to give the Parliament supreme control over executive administration. Most Roundheads appear to have sought a constitutional monarchy in place of the absolutist monarchy sought by Charles I. At the end of the Civil War in 1649, public antipathy towards the king was high enough to allow republican leaders such as Oliver Cromwell to abolish the monarchy completely and establish the Commonwealth of England. In the New Model Army it was a punishable offence to call a fellow soldier a Roundhead. This contrasted with the term ""Cavalier"" to describe supporters of. the Royalist cause, which was embraced by those who were the target of the epithet and used by them to describe themselves. The word was first used as a term of derision toward the end. of 1641, when the debates in Parliament in the Clergy Act 1640 were causing riots at Westminster. The demonstrators included London apprentices and Roundhead was a term for them because the regulations to which they had agreed included a provision for closely cropped hair. Some Puritans, but by no means all, wore their hair closely cropped round the head or flat and there was thus an obvious contrast between them and the men of courtly fashion, who wore long ringlets. The Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition quotes a contemporary authority's description of the crowd gathered at Westminster: ""They had the hair of their heads very few of them longer than their ears, whereupon it came to pass that those who usually with their cries attended at Westminster were by a nickname called Roundheads"". Richard Baxter ascribes the origin of the term to a remark made by Queen Henrietta Maria of France at the trial of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, earlier that year. The principal advisor to Charles II, Edward Hyde, said he would ""cut the throat of those round-headed dogs that bawled against bishops"" John Scopes was a teacher in Dayton, Tennessee. He was charged with violating Tennessee's Butler Act, which prohibited the teaching of evolution in Tennessee schools. Scopes's involvement in the so-called Scopes Monkey Trial came about after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced that it would finance a test case challenging the constitutionality of the Butler Act if they could find a Tennessee teacher willing to act as a defendant. The case ended on July 21, 1925, with Scopes found guilty and fined $100 for violating the law. The term Roundhead was used to refer to those with republican tendencies up until the Exclusion Crisis of 1678–1681. It was then superseded by ""Whig"", initially another term with pejorative connotations, and replaced by ""Tory"" in the aftermath of the crisis. The word Roundhead is now used to describe those who have long hair, especially among the ""Independent"" and ""high ranking"" Puritans (which included Cromwell) and the military rank-and-file (i.e. non-Presbyterian) Scopes died on October 21, 1970, at the age of 67. He is buried at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky, where he graduated in 1924 with a major in law and a minor in geology. He also taught high school football in Danville, Illinois, and was a member of the class of 1919 at Salem High School. His son, John Scopes Jr., was a football coach at Rhea County High School in Dayton. He died of a heart attack on October 17, 1991. He had been married for more than 30 years and leaves behind a wife and four children. He leaves behind two sons, John T. Scope III and John Thomas Scopes IV. His daughter, Mary Scopes, was born on August 3, 1900, and grew up in Salem, Illinois. She died on August 17, 2002, and she is buried in Springfield, Illinois; she is survived by her husband and two children. The Scopes family is still active in politics and has been involved with the Democratic National Committee since the 1980s. The family has also been involved in the creation of the National Park Service. erdict, and Scopes was fined 100 dollars. The case was appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court. In a 3-1 decision written by Chief Justice Grafton Green the Butler Act was held to be constitutional. After the trial Scopes accepted a scholarship for graduate study in geology. He then did geological field work in Venezuela for Gulf Oil of South America. In 1930, he returned to the University of Chicago for a third year of graduate study. After two years without professional employment, he took a position as a geologist with the United Gas Corporation, for which he studied oil reserves. He worked, in Houston, Texas then in Shreveport, Louisiana, until he retired in 1963. He died on October 21, 1970 at the age of 70. The Bedfordshire Clanger comes from the county of Bedfordshire.

John Huston did a fantastic job adapting Melville's masterpiece for film. Ray Bradbury did an excellent job adapting the dialogue and exposition from the novel for the film. he took giant and important chunks of essential dialogue, without needing to take up the extraneous scientific jargon or soliliqiues that are better suited for the printed page than the screen. He remains faithful to Melville's vision, and the important symbolism is there. It's a very difficult job, and Melville's novel is a very difficult book to adapt, but Bradbury, who apparently hadn't read the book before adapting it, did one hell of a job.
The actors are great, and it's a shame they didn't win any Oscars. Gregory Peck is excellent as the sullen, vengeance-driven Captain Aheab. He made the role his own, and knew when to be passionate and when to be calm and quiet. Some parts of the novel may seem wordy to viewers, but are important in conveying Melville's meaning, such as Father Mapple's sermon on man's obedience to God. If you have a short attention span, and only like action films that are short on substance, this movie is not for you. Everyone else must do themselves a favor and watch this classic. This is an adaptation for the ages.

You Shook Me All Night Long
""You Shook Me All Night Long"" is a song by Australian hard rock band  AC/DC, from the album Back in Black. The song also reappeared on their later album Who Made Who. It is AC/DC's first single to feature Brian Johnson as the lead singer and reached number 35 on the USA's Hot 100 pop singles chart in 1980. The single was re-released internationally in 1986, following the release of the album Who Made Who. The re-released single in 1986 contains the B-side(s): B1. ""She's Got Balls"" (Live, Bondi Lifesaver '77); B2. ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" (Live '83 – 12-inch maxi-single only).

""You Shook Me All Night Long"" placed at number 10 on VH1's list of ""The 100 Greatest Songs of the 80s"". It was also number 1 on VH1's ""Top Ten AC/DC Songs"". Guitar World placed ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" at number 80 on their ""100 Greatest Guitar Solos"" list.

The song sampled Head East's ""Never Been a Reason"" guitar riff, they had opened for them early in their career.

Live versions

The song has also become a staple of AC/DC concerts, and is rarely excluded from the setlist. 

Four live versions of the song were officially released. The first one appeared on the 1986 maxi-single ""You Shook Me All Night Long""; the second one was included on the band's album Live; the third version is on the soundtrack to the Howard Stern movie Private Parts, and also appears on the AC/DC box set Backtracks; and the fourth one is on the band's live album, Live at River Plate.

""You Shook Me All Night Long"" was also the second song to be played by AC/DC on Saturday Night Live in 2000, following their performance of ""Stiff Upper Lip.""  When AC/DC was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 by Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, they performed this song with Tyler. 

Johnson performed the song with Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden in New York, US in March 2014. The Salon publication stated on the following morning in its introduction to the video footage of the performance: ""This will either be your favorite video today, or a total musical nightmare!"" 

Composition 

The song is in the key G major. The main verse and riff follows a G–C–D chord progression.

Music video 

Two versions of the music video exist. The first version, directed by Eric Dionysius and Eric Mistler,  is similar to the other Back in Black videos (""Back in Black"", ""Hells Bells"", ""What Do You Do For Money Honey"", ""Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution"" and ""Let Me Put My Love Into You"") and is available on the special Back in Black, The Videos. It is also included on the Backtracks box set.

In the second version, directed by David Mallet  and released six years after the song's original release, Angus and Malcolm Young follow Johnson around the English town of Huddersfield, with Angus Young wearing his signature schoolboy outfit. The video clip casts the English glamour model Corinne Russell, a former Hill's Angel and Page 3 Girl—along with other leather clad women wearing suits with zips at the groin region—pedaling bicycles like machines in the background.

The VH1 series Pop-Up Video revealed that, during the scene with the mechanical bull, the woman playing Johnson's lover accidentally jabbed herself with her spur twice. The roadie who came to her aid married her a year later, and Angus Young gave them a mechanical bull for a wedding present as a joke. The original 1980 video features drummer Phil Rudd, while the 1986 video features drummer Simon Wright, who replaced Rudd in 1983. Rudd returned to AC/DC in 1994.

Passage:
Stormcock (album)
Stormcock is the fifth album by English folk / rock singer-songwriter and guitarist Roy Harper. It was first released in 1971 by Harvest Records and is widely considered to be his best record. 

History

The album contains four extended songs which showcase Harper's talents, both as songwriter and guitarist. But, perhaps most significantly, Stormcock ""...epitomized a hybrid genre that had no exclusive purveyors save Harper — epic progressive acoustic."".  The album features Jimmy Page on guitar, though upon the album's release, Page was credited as ""S. Flavius Mercurius"" for contractual reasons.

At the time, the album was not particularly well promoted by Harper's record label. Harper later stated: 

Nonetheless, Stormcock would remain a favourite album of Harper's fans. In October 2013 NME placed Stormcock at 377 in their list of ""The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time"" 

Title

The album's title, Stormcock, is an old English name for the mistle thrush (Turdus viscivorus). The male of this species ""is most vocal in the early morning"" and has a ""tendency to sing after, and sometimes during, wet and windy weather"" which ""led to the old name ""stormcock"""".  It is also, perhaps, a metaphor for Harper himself. Harper has an appreciation of birdlife and has made reference to many birds within songs on his albums.

Influence

35 years after its release (2006) fellow Mancunian Johnny Marr of English alternative rock band The Smiths said: 

Joanna Newsom cited Stormcock as an influence upon her 2006 release Ys  and in 2011, Robin Pecknold of Seattle, Washington-based folk band Fleet Foxes stated that he took inspiration from Stormcock when recording Fleet Foxes second album Helplessness Blues.

Digital remaster

The album was digitally remastered in 2007. The package included in a 20-page case-bound booklet with new pictures, prose and poetry, and Page's name was added to the album's credits. The album also showcases David Bedford's orchestral arrangements (Bedford would also collaborate on some of Harper's later releases).

Passage:
The Bottle Inn
The Bottle Inn is a 16th-century public house in Marshwood in Dorset, England which hosts the World Nettle Eating Championship. The building started life as an ale house being close to a church where people came to pay their tithes. It was named The Bottle Inn sometime late in the 18th Century when it became the first inn in the area to sell bottled beers. During its history the building has also housed the village shop and during World War II, the village school. The  Bottle Inn was purchased as a Free House in 1982 from Ushers Brewery by Michael and Pauline Brookes. Through their hard work they built up not only the food trade but also the local trade, establishing skittle teams, dart teams, table skittle teams and domino teams. This pub has always been a popular destination for holiday makers en route to and from the coast in the summer months.  

World Nettle Eating Championship

The Bottle Inn hosts the annual World Nettle Eating Championships as part of a charity beer festival.  Competitors are served  long stalks of stinging nettles from which they pluck and eat the leaves. After an hour the bare stalks are measured and the winner is the competitor with the greatest accumulated length of nettles. The contest began in the late 1980s when two farmers argued over who had the longest stinging nettles in their field and evolved into the World Nettle Eating Championships when one of the farmers promised to eat any nettle which was longer than his. The championship has separate men’s and women’s sections and attracts competitors from as far afield as Canada and Australia. 

In June 2010 Sam Cunningham, a fishmonger from Somerset won the contest, after eating 74 ft of nettles. 

In June 2014 Phillip Thorne, a chef from Colyton, Devon won the contest, after eating 80 ft of nettles.

Passage:
Midlands Grand National
|}

 

The Midlands Grand National is a Listed National Hunt race in Great Britain. It is a handicap steeplechase and is run at Uttoxeter Racecourse in March, over a distance of 4 miles, 1 furlong and 110 yards.

History

The first race was run on 3 May 1969.  The race was initially run over 4m2f and was increased up to 4m4f in 1977. During this period it would have been, assuming accurate measurements, by 24 yards or approximately the length of a cricket pitch, the longest race in the NH calendar. In 1991 the distance was dropped to 4m, before being upped to 4m2f in 1993. It has been run at its present distance of 4m1f110yds yards since 2004. 

The 1977 winner Watafella finished third in the race but was promoted to first place after the first and second, No Scotch and Evander were disqualified after it was realised they failed to meet the conditions of the race, along with three other runners. 

The race was not covered on television in its early years but was shown by Channel 4 during the 1980s and up until 1998. The BBC took over coverage between 1998 and 2005 before the race returned to Channel 4, who continue to cover until this day.

Passage:
Monologue
In theatre, a monologue (from Greek μονόλογος from μόνος mónos, ""alone, solitary"" and λόγος lógos, ""speech"") is a speech presented by a single character, most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the audience. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films,  etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry.  Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.

Similar literary devices

Monologues are similar to poems, epiphanies, and others in that they involve one 'voice' speaking but there are differences between them. For example, a soliloquy involves a character relating his or her thoughts and feelings to him/herself and to the audience without addressing any of the other characters. A monologue is the thoughts of a person spoken out loud.  Monologues are also distinct from apostrophes, in which the speaker or writer addresses an imaginary person, inanimate object, or idea.  Asides differ from each of these not only in length (asides are shorter) but also in that asides are not heard by other characters even in situations where they logically should be (e.g. two characters engaging in a dialogue interrupted by one of them delivering an aside).

History

In ancient Greek theatre, the origin of western drama, the conventional three actor rule was preceded by a two actor rule, which was itself preceded by a convention in which only a single actor would appear on stage, along with the chorus.  The origin of the monologue as a dramatic device, therefore, is not rooted in dialogue. It is, instead, the other way around; dialogue evolved from monologue.

Ancient Roman theatre featured monologues extensively, more commonly than either Ancient Greek theatre or modern theatre.  One of the key purposes of these monologues was to indicate the passage of significant amounts of time (that would be tedious to actually play out in real time) within scenes. This type of monologue is referred to as a linking monologue.  Other monologue types included ""entrance monologues"" and exit monologues.  In each of these cases a primary function is indicating the passage of time.

From Renaissance theatre onward, monologues generally focused on characters using the extended speech to pursue their dramatic need. Postmodern theatre, on the other hand, often embraces the performative aspects of the monologue, even to the point of challenging the boundary between character portrayal (e.g. acting) and autobiographical speeches. ×→→

Types of monologues

Interior monologues involve a character externalizing their thoughts so that the audience can witness experiences that would otherwise be mostly internal. In contrast, a dramatic monologue involves one character speaking to another character.  Monologues can also be divided along the lines of active and narrative monologues. In an active monologue a character is using their speech to achieve a clear goal. Narrative monologues simply involve a character telling a story and can often be identified by the fact that they are in the past tense. 

Audition monologues

Actors in theatre and sometimes in film and television may be called upon to use monologues for audition purposes. Audition monologues demonstrate an actor's ability to prepare a piece and deliver a performance.  These pieces are usually relegated to two minutes (sometimes less) and are often paired with a contrasting monologue. This can be a comic monologue paired with a dramatic monologue or it can mean classical paired with contemporary. The choice of monologues for an audition can often depend on the play in question or the role the actor wants to land. The audition monologue is a rite of passage with theatre actors and a tradition that continues today.

Which word describes a monologue where an actor addresses an audience by speaking his thoughts aloud?

Soliloquy
Passage:
Cliffs of Moher
The Cliffs of Moher ()  are located at the southwestern edge of the Burren region in County Clare, Ireland.   They rise 120 m above the Atlantic Ocean at Hag's Head and reach their maximum height of 214 m just north of O'Brien's Tower, eight kilometres to the north.  A round stone tower near the midpoint of the cliffs was built in 1835 by Sir Cornelius O'Brien.  From the cliffs and from atop the tower, visitors can see the Aran Islands in Galway Bay, the Maumturks and Twelve Pins mountain ranges to the north in County Galway, and Loop Head to the south. The cliffs rank amongst the top-visited tourist sites in Ireland  and receive almost one million visitors a year. The closest settlements are Liscannor (6 km south) and Doolin (7 km north).

Name

The cliffs take their name from an old fort called Moher, which once stood on Hag's Head, the southernmost point of the cliffs. The writer Thomas Johnson Westropp referred to it in 1905 as Moher Uí Ruis or Moher Uí Ruidhin.  The fort still stood in 1780 and is mentioned in an account from John Lloyd's A Short Tour Of Clare (1780).  It was demolished in 1808 to provide material for a new telegraph tower. The present tower near the site of the old Moher Uí Ruidhin was built as a lookout tower during the Napoleonic wars. 

Tourism

The cliffs are one of the most popular tourist destinations in Ireland and topped the list of attractions in 2006 by drawing almost one million visitors.  Since 2011, they have formed a part of the Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark, one of a family of geotourism destinations throughout Europe that are members of the European Geoparks Network. 

In the 1990s, Clare County Council initiated development plans to enable visitors to experience the cliffs without significant intrusive man-made amenities. In keeping with this approach, the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience was built into a hillside approaching the cliffs. The centre is also intended to be environmentally sensitive in its use of renewable energy systems including geothermal heating and cooling, solar panels, and grey water recycling. 

The €32 million facility was planned and built over a 17-year period and officially opened in February 2007. Facility exhibits include interactive media displays covering the geology, history, flora and fauna of the cliffs. A large multimedia screen displays a bird's-eye view from the cliffs, as well as video from the underwater caves below the cliffs. 

The visitor's centre charges €6 per adult, with children under 16 admitted free. This covers parking, access to the visitor centre and Atlantic Edge exhibition, and a contribution towards conservation and safety at the cliffs. 

The Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience won an award in the Interpret Britain & Ireland Awards 2007 awarded by the Association of Heritage Interpretation (AHI).  Although the award was specifically for the Atlantic Edge exhibition, the AHI assessed the entire visitor centre and site. The citation stated that the entire visitor centre was ""one of the best facilities that the judges had ever seen."" 

Separate ferry trips also allow tourists to view the cliffs from sea level. 

Geology and wildlife

The cliffs consist mainly of beds of Namurian shale and sandstone,  with the oldest rocks being found at the bottom of the cliffs. It is possible to see 300-million-year-old river channels cutting through, forming unconformities at the base of the cliffs.

There are an estimated 30,000 birds living on the cliffs, representing more than 20 species.  These include Atlantic puffins, which live in large colonies at isolated parts of the cliffs and on the small Goat Island, and razorbills.
The site is an Important Bird Area. 

Popular culture

The Cliffs of Moher have appeared in numerous media. In cinema, the cliffs have appeared in several films, including The Princess Bride (1987) (as the filming location for ""The Cliffs of Insanity""), Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009),  and Leap Year (2010).  The cliffs are mentioned in the Martin Scorsese film Bringing Out the Dead (1999) and are noted in the 2008 documentary Waveriders as the location of a large surfing wave known as ""Aileens"". 

In music, the cliffs have appeared in music videos, including Maroon 5's ""Runaway"" video, Westlife's ""My Love"", and Rich Mullins' ""The Color Green"". Most of singer Dusty Springfield's ashes were scattered at the cliffs by her brother, Tom.  Gaelic Storm's song ""Green Eyes Red Hair"" references the cliffs. 

In television, the cliffs appear in the episodes of Father Ted called ""Tentacles of Doom"" and ""Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rollerblading"" (1996).

In literature, the cliffs are an important location in Anthony Trollope's An Eye for an Eye, and in Eoin Colfer's The Wish List.

Transport

Bus Éireann route 350 links the Cliffs of Moher to several locations: Ennis, Ennistymon, Doolin, Lisdoonvarna, Kinvara and Galway. This service includes a number of journeys each way daily. There is also a privately operated shuttle bus that serves the site from Doolin.

Passage:
Claret Jug
The Golf Champion Trophy, commonly known as the Claret Jug, is the trophy presented to the winner of The Open Championship, (often called the ""British Open""), one of the four major championships in golf.

The awarding of the Claret Jug dates from 1872, when a new trophy was needed after Young Tom Morris had won the original Challenge Belt (presented by Prestwick Golf Club) outright in 1870 by winning the Championship three years in a row. Prestwick had both hosted and organised the Championship from 1860 to 1870.

By the time that Prestwick had reached agreement with the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers (based at Musselburgh) for the championship to rotate at these three venues, more than a year had passed. So, there was no event in 1871.

Each club contributed £10 to the cost of the new trophy, which is inscribed 'The Golf Champion Trophy', and was made by Mackay Cunningham & Company of Edinburgh.

When the 1872 event was played, the trophy still wasn't ready in time to be presented to Morris (who had won his fourth in a row) although his name was the first to be engraved on it. In 1872, Morris was presented with a medal as have all subsequent winners.

In 1873 Tom Kidd became the first winner to be actually presented with the Claret Jug after winning the Championship.

The original Claret Jug has been on permanent display at the clubhouse of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews since 1928. The original Challenge Belt is also on display at the same site, having been donated in 1908 by the Morris family.

The current Claret Jug was first awarded to Walter Hagen for winning the 1928 Open. The winner must return the trophy before the next year's Open, and receives a replica to keep permanently. Three other replicas exist — one in the British Museum of Golf at St Andrews, and two used for travelling exhibitions.

Every year, the winner's name is engraved on the Claret Jug before it is presented to him. The BBC always shows the engraver poised to start work, and the commentators like to speculate about when he will be sure enough of the outcome to begin. However, at the 1999 Open Championship, Jean van de Velde's name was engraved on the trophy before he famously choked with a triple-bogey on the 18th hole and Paul Lawrie subsequently won the playoff. Upon being awarded the Jug in 1989, Mark Calcavecchia said, ""How's my name going to fit on that thing?"" 

The Claret Jug has twice appeared on commemorative £5 Scottish banknotes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland: first in 2004, for the 250th Anniversary of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, then in 2005, the jug is shown held by Jack Nicklaus to mark his retirement.

The Claret Jug is awarded to the winner of which competition?

Passage:
Ballinasloe
Ballinasloe ()  is a town in the easternmost part of County Galway in Ireland. It is regarded as the largest town in County Galway with a population of 7,674, which includes Ballinasloe Urban and Ballinasloe Rural.

Name and history

The town developed as a crossing point on the River Suck, a tributary of the Shannon. The Irish placename – meaning the mouth of the ford of the crowds – reflects this purpose. The latter part of the name suggests the town has been a meeting place since ancient times. The patron saint of Ballinasloe is Saint Grellan, whom tradition believes built the first church in the area at Kilcloony. A local housing estate, a GAA club, the branch of Conradh na Gaeilge, and formerly a school are named after him.

Supermacs opened their first store there and there is now four stores open.

October Fair and Festival

Every October, Ballinasloe is host to the ancient annual October Fair. Chiefly agricultural in the past, it is now focused on the horse. The Ballinasloe Fair is one of the oldest horse fairs in Europe; bathed in history it dates back to the 18th century. Today the ever popular fair is still held, along with a festival that attracts up to 100,000 visitors from all over the world. The town also boasts a successful summer festival called An tSúca Fiain.

Economy

The biggest local employers are Portiuncula and St. Brigid's hospitals. The Dubarry shoe manufacturing company has been based in the town, although manufacturing at the plant ceased in November 2004.  The American pen manufacturing company A. T. Cross had a factory in the town for many years as did electrical components company Square D.

Ballinasloe like much of rural Ireland enjoyed a period of growth and expansion in the 2000s, thanks to the ""Celtic Tiger"" economic boom. However the town has suffered since the financial crash of 2008 and like many small towns in the region, it has seen a brain drain of the youth and educated.

Businesses and shops face competition from larger towns such as Athlone and Galway City.

As of 2015, employment in the town centres around its hotels, hospital and factories.

Transport

Ballinasloe railway station opened on 1 August 1851,  and is served by the Dublin–Galway railway line. Once a notorious bottleneck on the old Galway to Dublin road, on 18 December 2009, the town was officially bypassed for the first time, when the M6 motorway opened as an upgrade to the N6.
From 1828 to the 1960s, Ballinasloe was the terminus of the Grand Canal. Guinness Company used the town's canal stores to store and distribute the Guinness to the midlands. Grand Canal provided an easy route for Guinness barges to travel from Dublin to Shannon Harbour. A new public marina has been developed on the river in recent years that allows traffic from the Shannon navigation to access the town.

Local Media

A number of newspapers circulate in the Ballinasloe area, such as Ballinasloe Life magazine, the Connacht Tribune, Galway Advertiser, Athlone Topic and the Roscommon Herald. As Ballinasloe sits on the border between two counties it is served by 2 local radio stations, Galway Bay FM and Shannonside FM. Local radio from other neighbouring counties such as Midlands 103 and Tipp FM are well received in the area. National stations in the area include RTÉ Radio 1, 2FM, RTÉ Lyric FM, Today FM, and 4FM.

Sport

Ballinasloe itself harbours historically rich soccer, golf, and rugby clubs, alongside Duggan Park Gaelic Athletic Association grounds. The local GAA clubs are Ballinasloe GAA (incorporating St Grellan's Gaelic football club and the Ballinasloe Hurling Club), Derrymullen Handball Club and Ballinasloe Camogie Club. Ballinasloe has a boxing tradition as well, and two resident boxing clubs.

Schools

In Ballinasloe there are four national schools (Scoil Uí Cheithearnaigh, Creagh National School,    [http://www.stteresas.ie St Teresa's Special School] and Scoil an Chroí Naofa) and two secondary schools (St Joseph's College, Garbally and Ard Scoil Mhuire).

Twin towns

Chalonnes-sur-Loire, Maine-et-Loire, France. Since 1988.

Napa Valley is by far the most valuable appellation in the U.S. and that explains the fuss over the delimits of its borders.The official boundaries eventually included 16 sub-regions, some of which (Carneros, Chiles) lie outside the geographic valley itself. Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon fetches the highest prices of any American wine, so it’s no surprise that the valley represents 25 percent of California’s wine revenues. Any wine of any variety is easier to sell with “Napa Valley” on the label, but enhanced value comes with sub-regional names, such as: Diamond Mountain, Howell Mountain, Oakville, Mt Veeder, Rutherford, Spring Mountain, and Stags Leap. Only slightly less prestigious are Atlas Peak, Calistoga, Coombsville, Oak Knoll, St. Helena, Wild Horse Valley and Yountville.   Read more

Californian Cabernet Sauvignon
Known as the king of red wine grapes, Cabernet Sauvignon enjoys the same regal status in California as does in its native home in Bordeaux.
The most widely planted red wine grape in California, Cabernet Sauvignon commands the highest price per ton and is the dominant grape found in some of California's most prestigious brands.
Some of the most expensive wines in the United States are made from this noble grape. Cult wines like Screaming Eagle and Harlan Estate sell for thousands per bottle, but don't let that scare you—great non-cult Cabs can be found for much less, starting a... Read more

Manchego
Manchego (officially ,) is a cheese made in the La Mancha region of Spain from the milk of sheep of the  breed. Official  cheese is to be aged for between 60 days and two years.

 has a firm and compact consistency and a buttery texture, and often contains small, unevenly distributed air pockets. The colour of the cheese varies from white to ivory-yellow, and the inedible rind from yellow to brownish-beige. The cheese has a distinctive flavour, well-developed but not too strong, creamy with a slight piquancy, and leaves an aftertaste that is characteristic of sheep’s milk.

The designation  is protected under Spain's Denominación de Origen (DO) regulatory classification system,  and the cheese has been granted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status by the European Union. 

PDO requirements

To be designated as , the cheese must satisfy the following requirements: 
* It must have been produced in an area that is restricted to designated parts of the provinces of Albacete, Ciudad Real, Cuenca and Toledo that lie within the La Mancha region.
* It can be made only with the whole milk of sheep of the  breed that are raised on registered farms within the designated area.
* The cheese must have been aged for a minimum of 60 days (30 days for cheeses weighing up to 1.5 kg) and a maximum of two years.
* The cheese must be produced by pressing in a cylindrical mould that has a maximum height of 12 cm and a maximum diameter of 22 cm.

 cheese can be made from pasteurised or raw milk; if the latter, it may be labelled as  (artisan). The only permitted additives are natural rennet or another approved coagulating enzyme, and sodium chloride (salt).

Manufacture and labeling

The moulds in which the cheese is pressed are barrel-shaped. Traditionally,  cheese was made by pressing the curd in plaited esparto grass baskets, which left a distinctive zig-zag pattern (known as ) on the rind.  Today the same effect is achieved by the mould, the inside of which has a design in relief that imparts to the finished cheese an embossed pattern similar to that of woven esparto grass. The top and bottom surfaces of the cheese are impressed with a design of an ear of wheat.

During the maturation process, manchego cheese develops a natural rind. The regulations permit this to be washed, coated in paraffin, dipped in olive oil, or treated with certain approved transparent substances, but require that it must not be removed if the cheese is to be marketed as PDO.

Cheeses that meet the DO requirements carry a casein tab that is applied when the cheese is in the mould and bear a distinctive label that is issued by the Manchego Cheese Denomination of Origin Regulating Council; this carries the legend , a serial number, and artwork depicting Don Quixote de La Mancha. 

A cheese that is similar to  and made in the same region, but from a blend of cow's, goat's, and ewe's milk, is sold as  or  cheese.

Varieties

 has variety of different flavours depending on its age. There are four versions of maturity sold: 

*  – the fresh cheese is aged for only 2 weeks, with a rich but mild flavour. Produced in small quantities, it is rarely found outside Spain.
*   is a semi-firm cheese aged for three weeks to three months, somewhat milder than curado.
*  is a semi-firm cheese aged for three to six months with a sweet and nutty flavor.
* , aged for one year is firm with a sharper flavour the longer it is aged and a rich deep pepperiness to it. It grates well, but can also be eaten on its own or as tapas. 

America

North America

In Mexico and Spanish-speaking areas of the United States,  or  (manchego-type cheese) is the name given to a cow's milk cheese similar in taste to Monterey Jack. It melts well and is often used in quesadillas. Apart from the name, this cheese has little in common with the Spanish variety. 

Central America

In Costa Rica, two companies (Dos Pinos and Los Alpes ) 
produce a manchego-type cheese (queso tipo manchego) which can come with a drawing of Don Quijote on the labels. One company also makes a manchego-type cheese with basil added. These Costa-Rican cheeses can come dipped in paraffin, and some have the  pattern pressed on the side.

Welshpool
Welshpool () is a town in Wales, historically in the county of Montgomeryshire, but currently administered as part of the unitary authority of Powys. The town is 4 mi from the Wales–England border and low-lying on the River Severn; its Welsh language name Y Trallwng literally means ""the marshy or sinking land"". Welshpool is the fourth largest town in Powys.

In English it was initially known as Pool but its name was changed to Welshpool in 1835 to distinguish it from the English town of Poole.  It has a population of 6,664 (United Kingdom Census 2011), contains much Georgian architecture and is just north of Powis Castle.

History

St Cynfelin (he is also known as St Matu) is reputed to be the founder of the church of St Mary's and St Cynfelin's in the town during ""the age of the saints in Wales"" in the 5th and 6th centuries.

The parish of Welshpool roughly coincides with the medieval commote of Ystrad Marchell in the cantref of Ystlyg in the Kingdom of Powys.

The Long Mountain, which plays as a backdrop to most of Welshpool, once served as the ultimate grounds for defence for fortresses in the times when the town was just a swampy marsh. Welshpool served briefly as the capital of Powys Wenwynwyn or South Powys after its prince was forced to flee the traditional Welsh royal site at Mathrafal in 1212. After 1284 Powys Wenwynwyn ceased to exist. 

The town was devastated by the forces of Owain Glyndŵr in 1400 at the start of his rebellion against the English king Henry IV. Today the waymarked long-distance footpath and National Trail Glyndŵr's Way runs through the town.

In 1411 the priest at the church St Mary's and St Cynfelin's was Adam of Usk.

Historic buildings

The Mermaid Inn, 28 High Street, was very probably an early 16th century merchant’s house, placed on a burgage plot between the High Street and Alfred Jones Court. The timber-ramed building has long storehouse or wing to the rear. The frontage was remodelled  1890, by Frank H. Shayler, architect, of Shrewsbury. Early illustrations of the building show that prior to this it had a thatched roof and that the timbering was not exposed. There is a passage to side with heavy box-framing in square panels, with brick infill exposed in side elevation and in rear wing. The frontage was exposed by Shayler to show decorative timber work on the upper storey. An Inn by the 19th century when it was owned by a family named Sparrow. 
  

There is an octagonal brick cockpit in New Street, which was built in the early 18th century and was in continual use for cockfighting until the practice was outlawed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1849.  , it is the home of the town's Women's Institute.

Transport

Welshpool railway station is on the Cambrian Line and is served by Arriva Trains Wales. The town is also the starting point of the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway, a narrow-gauge heritage railway popular with tourists, with its terminus station at Raven Square. The light railway once ran through the town to the Cambrian Line railway station, but today Raven Square, located on the western edge of the town, is the eastern terminus of the line.

A small network of bus services link surrounding towns and villages, mainly operated by Tanat Valley Coaches. Notable is service No X75, serving Shrewsbury to the east and Newtown and Llanidloes to the south west, also service No D71 to Oswestry via Guilsfield and Llanymynech. In addition there is a local town service operated by Owen's Coaches. The semi-disused Montgomery Canal also runs through Welshpool. To the south of the town is Welshpool Airport which is also known as the Mid Wales Airport.  Three major trunk roads pass through Welshpool: the A458, A483 and the A490.

Economy

The local economy is primarily based upon agriculture and local industry. The Smithfield Livestock Market is the largest one-day sheep market in Europe, whilst the town's industrial estates are home to numerous different types of small industry.
Due to the town's small size and population the attraction of high street stores is limited, meaning many of the residents are forced to shop in neighbouring towns like Newtown and Shrewsbury.

Education

The town is the home of Ardwyn Nursery and Infants School, Oldford Nursery and Infants School, Gungrog Nursery and Infants School, Maes-y-dre Primary School and Welshpool High School is a secondary school which teaches a range of pupils from ages 11–18 and is consistently set to a very high standard of education throughout Key Stage 3 and 4 and A Level studies.

Sport

Welshpool has a football club and a rugby union club, the former being Welshpool Town F.C. and the latter, Welshpool Rugby Football Club. The town also has hockey and cricket clubs. The Montgomeryshire Marauders Rugby League Club are also nominally based in Welshpool, as this is where the majority of their home fixtures take place.

St. Gallen–Altenrhein Airport
St. Gallen–Altenrhein Airport  is a small airport in Altenrhein in the Canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland near Lake Constance. It is also known under its trading name People's Business Airport  and is the home base for People's Viennaline.

History

At the end of World War II, Swiss authorities identified existing locations that were to be modernized as regional airports, a second tier of infrastructure to support the primary urban airports, with St. Gallen-Altenrhein being one of the five. 

Austrian Airlines served St. Gallen-Altenrhein from Vienna since 2003 when it took over the route from Rheintalflug, a predecessor of InterSky. The airport decided to terminate the contracts with Austrian in 2011 and started their own airline, People's Viennaline, to serve the route. Austrian decided to continue the route as well in direct competition. As a result, there were up to six daily flights from the small airport to Vienna during that period. In spring 2013, Austrian announced the termination of their route to Vienna due to continuing losses as a result of the harsh competition.  After that, People's offered a codeshare agreement to Austrian, which they declined. 

Facilities

Terminal

The airport features a small passenger terminal building and some apron and hangar stands for aircraft such as the Embraer 170, business jets or general aviation planes such as the Cessna 172. As there are no jet bridges, walk-boarding is used.

Runway

The paved, eastbound runway 10 is equipped with an Instrument landing system (ILS CAT I).  Due to its short length the main runway can only be used by smaller passenger aircraft such as the Embraer E-Jets or the Bombardier Q Series.

Airlines and destinations

The following airlines offer regular scheduled and charter flights at St. Gallen–Altenrhein Airport: 

The nearest bigger airport is Friedrichshafen Airport in Germany, on the opposite side of Lake Constance 45 km to the northwest by ferry.

Ground transportation

The airport can be reached via motorway A1 (Zürich - Winterthur, Exit Rheineck-Thal). Taxis and a shuttle service are available. There is also a scheduled bus connection from the airport to the nearby towns of Rorschach and Rheineck and their railway stations.

Ringo Kid
The Ringo Kid  is a fictional Western hero in the Marvel Comics' universe, whose comic book series was originally released by the company's 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics. A lesser-known character than the company's Kid Colt, Rawhide Kid, or Two-Gun Kid, he also appeared in a reprint series in the 1970s.

The character is unrelated to the actor John Wayne's ""Ringo Kid"" in the Western film Stagecoach.

Publication history

Atlas Comics' Ringo Kid debuted in the first issue of a series billed on its trademarked cover logo as Ringo Kid for all but two issues (#1 and #3, cover-billed as Ringo Kid Western).  Created by an unknown writer and artist Joe Maneely, it ran 21 issues (cover-dated Aug. 1954 - Sept. 1957), drawn primarily by either Maneely or Fred Kida. Stories also ran occasionally in Wild Western, beginning with issue #38 (Nov. 1954), initially drawn by Maneely, with artist John Severin taking the reins in at least issues #46-47 (Nov. 1955 - Jan. 1956). Ringo was the lead feature in the two-issue anthology series Western Trails #1-2 (May & July 1957).   He also appears on the cover of Wild Western #39 (Dec. 1954), but not in an interior story.  

A five-page story entitled ""The Ringo Kid"" in Atlas' Western Outlaws & Sheriffs #73 (June 1952) is unrelated,  as is the four-page story ""Ringo Kid"" in Wild Western #26 (Feb. 1953). 

Marvel reprinted the series in Ringo Kid vol. 2, #1-30 (Jan. 1970 - Nov. 1976), often with the original Maneely covers. The Ringo Kid made his first appearance in present-day stories in a time travel tale in the superhero-team comic The Avengers #142 (Dec. 1975)

Marvel writer Steve Englehart planned a revival series at about this time, with art by Dick Ayers: ""Every series I did took off so Marvel kept giving me more. I relaunched this classic Western — always my favorite of Marvel's true cowboy heroes (as opposed to the Two-Gun Kid, whom I also liked but who was more a superhero) — with classic Western artist Dick Ayres [sic]. But after this first issue was drawn and scripted, Marvel decided to do more superheroes and fewer cowboys, so it was set aside before inking"". 

Fictional character biography

The Ringo Kid, dressed all in black, is a heroic gunslinger of the 19th-century American Old West with a Caucasian father, Cory Rand, and a Native American mother, Dawn Star, variously referred to as a Comanche or a Cheyenne ""princess of her tribe despite the fact that the very idea of princesses was alien to that culture, imagined by settlers of European extraction, projecting their notions of royalty onto the natives."" He was treated as an outcast because of his mixed heritage, and on the run after being falsely accused of a crime. With his sidekick Dull Knife, of his mother's people, he roamed the frontier atop his horse, Arab. His specific mission or goal appears not to have been stated explicitly, but there is intimation of some law-enforcement function: As many covers note breathlessly, ""Ringo!"" is ""The name that makes killers tremble!""

The second version, released six years after the song's original release, shows Angus and Malcolm Young following Johnson around the English town of Huddersfield, wearing his signature schoolboy outfit. Stormcock is the fifth album by English folk / rock singer-songwriter and guitarist Roy Harper. It was first released in 1971 by Harvest Records and is widely considered to be his best record. The album features Jimmy Page on guitar, though upon the album's release, Page was credited as ""S. Flavius Mercurius"" for contractual reasons. In October 2013 NME placed Stormcock at 377 in their list of ""The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time"" The album's title, Stormcock, is an old English name for the mistle thrush (Turdus viscivorus). The male of this species ""is most vocal in the early morning"" and has a ""tendency to sing after, and sometimes during, wet and windy weather"" which ""led to the old name ""stormcock"""". It is also, perhaps, a metaphor for Harper himself.

It is heard in the television series New Girl. It has been covered by Shania Twain, Big & Rich, and Anastacia. It also appeared on the soundtrack to the film ""The Godfather: Part II"" It was digitally remastered in 2007 and is now considered one of Harper's best albums. It features David Bedford's orchestral arrangements on some of the tracks. The band also collaborated on Harper's later releases (including ""The Same Old Rock"" and ""Hors d'œuvres""). The album was released on Harvest Records in 1971 and was released in a 20-page case-bound booklet with new pictures, prose and poetry, and Page's name was added to the credits. The package included in the booklet also included new pictures and poetry. Harper later stated that Stormcock would remain a favourite album of his fans. He said:  ""Stormcock...epitomized a hybrid genre that had no exclusive purveyors save Harper — epic progressive acoustic."" The album contains four extended songs which showcase Harper's talents, both as songwriter and Guitarist. It contains an ""Introduction to Tungsten"", among other things. All tracks credited to Roy Harper are credited to the band's producer, Peter Jenner, and organist David Bedford. The track listing for ""One Man and My Woman"" is as follows: ""One Man Rock Roll Band"" – 7:23:01Personnel"" – 13:01""Me and my Woman"" – 12:37:37#""The same Old Rock and Rock"" – 24:24:24""The SameOld Rock"" The Bottle Inn is a 16th-century public house in Marshwood in Dorset, England. The building started life as an ale house being close to a church where people came to pay their tithes. It was named The Bottle Inn sometime late in the 18th Century when it became the first inn in the area to sell bottled beers. During its history the building has also housed the village shop and during World War II, the village school. It hosts the annual World Nettle Eating Championships as part of a charity beer festival. Competitors are served  long stalks of stinging nettles from which they pluck and eat the leaves. After an hour the bare stalks are measured and the winner is the competitor with the greatest accumulated length of nettle. The contest began in the late 1980s when two farmers argued over who had the longest stingingnettles in their field. It evolved into the World Nettles Eating Championships when one of the farmers promised to eat any nettle which was longer than his. In June 2014 Phillip Thorne, a chef from Colyton, Devon won the contest, after eating 80 ft ofNettle. The Midlands Grand National is a Listed National Hunt race in Great Britain. It is a handicap steeplechase and is run at Uttoxeter Racecourse in March, over a distance of 4 miles, 1 furlong and 110 yards. The first race was run on 3 May 1969 and was initially run over 4m2f and was increased up to 4m4f in 1977. The race was not covered on television in its early years but was shown by Channel 4 during the 1980s and up until 1998. The BBC took over coverage between 1998 and 2005 before the race returned to Channel 4, who continue to cover until this day. No horse has won the race more than once and no horse has ever won it more than two times. The winner of the race in 1977 was Watafella, who finished third in the race but was promoted to first place after the first and second, No Scotch and Evander were disqualified after it was realised they failed to meet the conditions of therace, along with three other runners. In 2004 the distance was dropped to 4M1f110yds yards and it has been run at its present distance  of 4m1f 110ydsyards since 2004. A monologue is a speech presented by a single character, most often to express their mental thoughts aloud. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films, etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry. They share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. But there are, however, distinctions between each of these devices. The origin of the monologue as a dramatic device, therefore, is not rooted in dialogue. It is, instead, the other way around; dialogue evolved from monologue. Monologue is the thoughts of a person spoken out loud. In an active monologue a character is using their speech to achieve a clear goal. Narrative monologues simply involve a character telling a story and can often be identified by the fact that they are in the past tense. Audition monologue demonstrate an actor's ability to prepare a piece and are usually relegated to deliver a two-minute piece. These pieces are often paired with two minutes (sometimes and are often pair with a contraption) The Midlands Grand National is one of the most popular races in the world. It takes place over three days in the South West of England and takes place at the Cheltenham Festival. The racecourse stages the Grand National, which takes place in April each year. The winner of the race is announced on the final day of the event, and the winner is announced the following day. For more information on how to get your hands on a copy of this year’s Grand National guide, visit www.grandnational.org.uk or click here for details on the racecourse and jockey. The 2013 Grand National will be held at Chester International, with the winner to be announced the day after the final. The Grand National has been running since 1966 and has been held every year since 1978. It will be the first time the race has been staged in the south west of England since the 1970s. It has also been held in the north west of the UK since the 1980s, and in the North West since the 1990s. The last time it was held was in 1998, when it took place in the West Midlands, and it will also be held in 2015. ting monologue. This can be a comic monologue paired with a dramatic monologue or it can mean classical paired with contemporary. The choice of monologues for an audition can often depend on the play in question or the role the actor wants to land. The audition monologue is a rite of passage with theatre actors and a tradition that continues today. The Cliffs of Moher are located at the southwestern edge of the Burren region in County Clare, Ireland. They rise 120 m above the Atlantic Ocean at Hag's Head and reach their maximum height of 214 m just north of O'Brien's Tower, eight kilometres to the north. The cliffs are one of the most popular tourist destinations in Ireland and topped the list of attractions in 2006 by drawing almost one million visitors. The visitor's centre charges €6 per adult, with children under 16 admitted free. The centre is also intended to be environmentally sensitive in its use of renewable energy systems including geothermal heating and cooling, solar panels, and grey water recycling. The €32 million facility was planned and built over a 17-year period and officially opened in February 2007. Facility exhibits include interactive media displays covering the geology, history, flora and fauna of the cliffs. It is to see 300-year-old river channels cutting through the cliffs, forming unconformities at the base of the cliff. There are an estimated 30,000 birds living on the cliffs and an estimated 20,000 in the surrounding area. The closest settlements are Liscannor (6 km south) and Doolin (7 km north) The cliffs take their name from an old fort called Moher, which once stood on Hag’s Head, the southernmost point. The present tower near the site of the old Moher Uí Ruidhin was built as a lookout tower during the Napoleonic wars. The fort still stood in 1780 and is mentioned in an account from John Lloyd's A Short Tour Of Clare (1780)  It was demolished in 1808 to provide material for a new telegraph tower. Since 2011, they have formed a part of a family of geotourism destinations throughout Europe that are members of the European Geoparks Network. liffs, representing more than 20 species. Atlantic puffins, which live in large colonies at isolated parts of the cliffs and on the small Goat Island, and razorbills. The site is an Important Bird Area. Most of singer Dusty Springfield's ashes were scattered at the cliffs by her brother, Tom. Gaelic Storm's song ""Green Eyes Red Hair"" references the cliffs. The cliffs appear in the episodes of Father Ted called ""Tentacles of Doom"" and ""Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rollerblading"" (1996) The cliffs are an important location in Anthony Trollope's An Eye for an Eye, and in Eoin Colfer's The Wish List. Bus Éireann route 350 links the Cliffs of Moher to several locations: Ennis, Ennistymon, Doolin, Lisdoonvarna, Kinvara and Galway. There is also a privately operated shuttle bus that serves the site from Dool in. The Golf Champion Trophy, commonly known as the Claret Jug, is the trophy presented to the winner of The Open Championship, (often called the ""British Open""), one of the four major championships in golf. In 1873 Tom Kidd became the first winner to be actually presented with the Clare Jug after winning the Championship. The original Challenge Belt is on display at The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews since 1928. The winner must return the trophy before the next year's Open, and receives a replica to keep. Three other replicas exist — one in the British Museum of Golf at St Andrews and two in the Royal & Ancient Golf club's clubhouse and at the site of the first Open Championship in 1872. iReport: Where are the best places in Ireland to see the best views of the Irish coast?

The Irish Sea is one of Ireland's most popular tourist attractions, with more than 1,000 miles of coastline and more than 2,000km of coastline. It is also the most visited tourist attraction in the UK, with over 3,000,000 visitors a year. The Irish Coast is the second most popular destination in Ireland, after the Dingle Peninsula, and is the third most popular in the United States. Ballinasloe is the largest town in County Galway with a population of 7,674. The town developed as a crossing point on the River Suck, a tributary of the Shannon. The Claret Jug has twice appeared on commemorative £5 Scottish banknotes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland. The biggest local employers are Portiuncula and St. Brigid's hospitals. The Dubarry shoe manufacturing company has been based in the town, although manufacturing at the plant ceased in November 2004. The Ballinasloe Fair is one of the oldest horse fairs in Europe; bathed in history it dates back to the 18th century. A new marina has been developed on the river in recent years that allows the traffic from the river to travel from Dublin to Shannon Harbour. The patron saint of Ballinas Chloe is Saint Grellan, whom tradition believes built the first church in the area at Kilcloony. A local housing estate, a GAA club, the branch of Conradh na Gaeilge, and formerly a school are named after him. The Irish placename – meaning the mouth of the ford of the crowds – suggests the town has been a meeting place since ancient times. On 18 December 2009, the town was officially for the first time, when the M6 motorway opened as an upgrade to the N6. Once a notorious bottleneck on the old Galway to Dublin road, on 18 December 2011 the town's bypass was officially opened. It is served by the Dublin–Galway railway line and is on the Dublin-Galway motorway. It also boasts a successful summer festival called An tSúca Fiain, which attracts up to 100,000 visitors from all over the world every October. It has suffered since the financial crash of 2008 and like many small towns in the region, it has seen a brain drain of the youth and educated. It was the terminus of the Grand Canal in the 1960s when the Guinness Company used the town to store and distribute Guinness to the public. As of 2015, employment in theTown centres around its hotels, hospital and factories. It's also the home of Supermacs, who opened their first store there and there is now four stores open. The nearest town is Athlone and Galway City, but the town is also home to a number of other small towns such as Athlones and Galways City. Ballinasloe sits on the border between two counties. It is served by 2 local radio stations, Galway Bay FM and Shannonside FM. There are four national schools (Scoil Uí Cheithearnaigh, Creagh National School,    [http://www.stteresas.ie St Teresa's Special School] and Scoil an Chroí Naofa) There are two secondary schools (St Joseph's College, Garbally and Ard Scoil Mhuire). There are also two resident boxing clubs. The town has historically rich soccer, golf, and rugby clubs, alongside Duggan Park Gaelic Athletic Association grounds. The local GAA clubs are Ballinasloe GAA (incorporating St Grellan's Gaelic football club and the Ballinas Chloe Hurling Club) and Derrymullen Handball Club. There is also a boxing tradition as well, and two residentBoxing clubs. In the town there are two pubs, one in the town centre and the other in the centre of the town. It has a population of 2,000, and is one of the smallest towns in Ireland. It was once called Dun-Leodha (the original name of Ballinsloe) by the Connachtmen, but is now known as Ballinloe. It sits in the heart of the Napa Valley winegrowing region, which is home to some of the most prestigious brands in the U.S. The most widely planted red wine grape in California, Cabernet Sauvignon commands the highest price per ton and is the dominant grape found in some of California's most prestigious wines. It can be found for much less, but don't let that scare you—great non-cult-cult grape Cabsabs can also be found in California for less than £20 per bottle. It's the most expensive grape in the United States, so it's no surprise that the valley represents 25 percent of California’s wine revenues. Only four per cent of California wine originates from the valley, but it's still the most valuable appellation in the country. The area has 16 sub-regions, some of which (Carneros, Chiles) lie outside the geographic valley itself. The official boundaries eventually included 16Sub-Regions, including Diamond Mountain, Howell Mountain, Oakville, Mt Veeder, Rutherford, Spring Mountain, and Stags Leap, and Yountville. Since 1988, the official boundaries have also included Atlas Peak, Calistoga, Coombsville, Oak Knoll, St Helena and Wild Horse Valley. The cheese has a distinctive flavour, well-developed but not too strong, creamy with a slight piquancy. The colour of the cheese varies from white to ivory-yellow, and the inedible rind from yellow to brownish-beige. The designation is protected under Spain's Denominación de Origen (DO) regulatory classification system. The cheese has been granted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status by the European Union. Official cheese is to be aged for between 60 days and two years. There are four versions of maturity sold: fresh cheese is aged for only 2 weeks, with a rich but mild flavour. Produced in small quantities, it is rarely found outside Spain. In Mexico and Spanish-speaking areas of the United States, or (manchego) is the name given to a cow's milk cheese similar in taste to Monterey Jack. It melts well and is often used in quesadillas. In Costa Rica, two companies produce a manchego-type cheese (Dosqueso tipo manche go) which can come with a Don Quixote drawing on the labels. One company also makes a cheese with a basil-type addee on the Quijote labels. It can be made from pasteurised or raw milk; if the latter, it may be labelled as (artisan). The only permitted additives are natural rennet or another approved coagulating enzyme, and sodium chloride (salt) The cheese must be produced by pressing in a cylindrical mould that has a maximum height of 12 cm and a maximum diameter of 22 cm. It must have been produced in an area that is restricted to designated parts of the provinces of Albacete, Ciudad Real, Cuenca and Toledo that lie within the La Mancha region. The top and bottom surfaces of the cheeses are impressed with a design of an ear of wheat. The regulations permit this to be washed, coated in paraffin, dipped in olive oil, or treated with certain approved transparent substances, but require that it must not be removed if the cheese is going to be marketed as PDO. It grates well, but can also be eaten on its own or as tapas. It is sold as a variety of different flavours depending on its age, such as curado or queso. It has little in common with the Spanish variety. Welshpool is a town in the county of Montgomeryshire, but currently administered as part of the unitary authority of Powys. The town is 4 mi from the Wales–England border and is low-lying on the River Severn. The name Y Trallwng literally means ""the marshy or sinking land"". Welshpool is the fourth largest town in Powys and has a population of 6,664. It was initially known as Pool but its name was changed to Welshpool in 1835 to distinguish it from the English town of Poole. The Mermaid Inn, 28 High Street, was very probably an early 16th century merchant’s house, placed on a burgage plot between the High Street and Alfred Jones Court. There is an octagonal brick cockpit in New Street, which was built in the early 18th century and was in continual use for cockfighting until the practice was outlawed by the practice in 1849. Welshpool railway station is on the Cambrian Line and is served by Arriva Trains Wales. It is also the starting point of the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway, a narrow-gauge heritage railway popular with tourists, with its terminus station at Raven Square. The waymarked long-distance footpath and National Trail Glyndŵr's Way runs through the town. To the south of the town is Welshpool Airport which is also known as the Mid Wales Airport. Three major trunk roads pass through the local economy: the A458, the A490 and the A483. The Long Mountain, which plays as a backdrop to most of Welshpool, once served as the ultimate grounds for defence for fortresses in the times when the town was just a swampy marsh. The local economy is primarily based upon agricultur based upon the Long Mountain and is also used as a source of income for the town's residents. It has a small network of bus services link surrounding towns and villages, mainly operated by Tanat Valley Coaches. Notable is service No X75, serving Shrewsbury to the east and Newtown and Llanymymymy to the south west, as well as service No Dilsfield to Oswestry to the north and south-west, and also a local service No 71 to Guilsfield and Droitwich. The Welshpool Canal runs through Welshpool also as the semi-disused Montgomery Canal. Welshpool has a football club and a rugby union club, the former being Welshpool Town F.C. and the latter, Welshpool Rugby Football Club. The Montgomeryshire Marauders Rugby League Club are also nominally based in Welshpool, as this is where the majority of their home fixtures take place. The Smithfield Livestock Market is the largest one-day sheep market in Europe, whilst the town's industrial estates are home to numerous different types of small industry. Welshpool High School is a secondary school which teaches a range of pupils from ages 11–18 and is consistently set to a very high standard of education throughout Key Stage 3 and 4 and A Level studies. The airport features a small passenger terminal building and some apron and hangar stands for aircraft such as the Embraer 170, business jets or general aviation planes. As there are no jet bridges, walk-boarding is used. There is also a scheduled bus connection from the airport to the nearby towns of Rorschach and Rheineck and their railway stations. The nearest bigger airport is Friedrichshafen Airport in Germany, on the opposite side of Lake Constance 45 km to the northwest by ferry. St. Gallen-Altenrhein Airport can be reached via motorway A1 (Zürich - Winterthur, Exit R heineck-Thal). Taxis and a shuttle service are available. It is also known under its trading name People's Business Airport  and is the home base for People's Viennaline. Austrian Airlines served St Gallen–AltenRhein from Vienna since 2003 when it took over the route from Rheintalflug, a predecessor of InterSky. In spring 2013, Austrian announced the termination of their route to Vienna due to continuing losses as a result of the harsh competition. Due to its short length the main runway can only be used by smaller passenger aircraft such. as the Bombardier E-Jets or the Bombadier Q Series. The following airlines offer regular scheduled and charter flights at the airport:   Airbus, Lufthansa, KLM, Swiss Airline, Air Canada, Swissair, Air France, Swiss Tourism, Air Germany, Air Switzerland, Swissmar, Swissmalta and Swissmar Airlines. Marvel Comics' Ringo Kid debuted in the first issue of a series billed on its trademarked cover logo as ""Ringo Kid Western"" Created by an unknown writer and artist Joe Maneely, it ran 21 issues (cover-dated Aug. 1954 - Sept. 1957) Ringo was the lead feature in the two-issue anthology series Western Trails #1-2 (May & July 1957) He also appears on the cover of Wild Western #39 (Dec. 1954), but not in an interior story. He was treated as an outcast because of his mixed heritage, and on the run after being falsely accused of a crime. With his sidekick Dull Knife, of his mother's people, he roamed the frontier atop his horse, Arab. His specific mission or goal appears not to have been stated explicitly, but there is intimation of some law-enforcement function. As many covers note breathlessly, ""Ringo!"" is ""The name that makes killers tremble!"" The Ringokid made his first appearance in present-day stories in a time travel tale in the superhero-team comic The Avengers #142 ( Dec. 1975)Marvel writer Steve Englehart planned a revival series at about this time, with art by Dick Ayers. But after this first issue was drawn and scripted, Marvel decided to do more superheroes and fewer cowboys, so it was set aside before inking. It was later relaunched with classic Western artist Dick Ayres [sic]. It was one of Marvel's true cowboy heroes (as opposed to the Two-Gun Kid, whom I also liked but who was more a superhero)"

Childe Harold's Pilgrimage
Childe Harold's Pilgrimage is a lengthy narrative poem in four parts written by Lord Byron. It was published between 1812 and 1818 and is dedicated to ""Ianthe"". The poem describes the travels and reflections of a world-weary young man who, disillusioned with a life of pleasure and revelry, looks for distraction in foreign lands. In a wider sense, it is an expression of the melancholy and disillusionment felt by a generation weary of the wars of the post-Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras. The title comes from the term childe, a medieval title for a young man who was a candidate for knighthood.

Origins

The poem contains elements thought to be autobiographical, as Byron generated some of the storyline from experience gained during his travels through Portugal, the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea between 1809 and 1811.. The ""Ianthe"" of the dedication was the term of endearment he used for Lady Charlotte Harley, about 11 years old when  Childe Harold was first published. Charlotte Bacon née Harley was the second daughter of 5th Earl of Oxford and Lady Oxford, Jane Elizabeth Scott. Throughout the poem Byron, in character of Childe Harold, regretted his wasted early youth, hence re-evaluating his life choices and re-designing himself through going on the pilgrimage, during which he lamented on various historical events including the Iberian Peninsular War among others.

Despite Byron's initial hesitation at having the first two cantos of the poem published because he felt it revealed too much of himself,  it was published, at the urging of friends, by John Murray in 1812, and brought both the poem and its author to immediate and unexpected public attention. Byron later wrote, ""I awoke one morning and found myself famous"".  The first two cantos in John Murray's edition were illustrated by Richard Westall, well-known painter and illustrator who was then commissioned to paint portraits of Byron.

Byronic hero

The work provided the first example of the Byronic hero.  The idea of the Byronic hero is one that consists of many different characteristics. The hero must have a rather high level of intelligence and perception as well as be able to easily adapt to new situations and use cunning to his own gain. It is clear from this description that this hero is well-educated and by extension is rather sophisticated in his style. Aside from the obvious charm and attractiveness that this automatically creates, he struggles with his integrity, being prone to mood swings. Generally, the hero has a disrespect for certain figures of authority, thus creating the image of the Byronic hero as an exile or an outcast. The hero also has a tendency to be arrogant and cynical, indulging in self-destructive behaviour which leads to the need to seduce women. Although his sexual attraction through being mysterious is rather helpful, it often gets the hero into trouble. Characters with the qualities of the Byronic hero have appeared in novels, films and plays ever since.

Structure

The poem has four cantos written in Spenserian stanzas, which consist of eight iambic pentameter lines followed by one alexandrine (a twelve syllable iambic line), and has rhyme pattern ABABBCBCC.

Interpretations

Childe Harold became a vehicle for Byron's own beliefs and ideas, but in the preface to canto four Byron complains that his readers conflate him and Child Harold too much, so he will not speak of Harold as much in the final canto. According to Jerome McGann, by masking himself behind a literary artifice, Byron was able to express his view that ""man's greatest tragedy is that he can conceive of a perfection which he cannot attain"". 

Cultural references

The poem's protagonist is referenced several times in description of the eponymous hero in Alexander Pushkin's Eugene Onegin.

Parts of it have been quoted towards the end of Asterix in Belgium and the 2000 film Britannic.

Hector Berlioz drew inspiration from this poem in the creation of his second symphony, a programmatic and arguably semi-autobiographical work called Harold en Italie.

In Anthony Trollope's third book of his Palliser novels, The Eustace Diamonds, Rev. Emilius read the first half of the fourth canto of this poem to Lizzie Eustace.

","Passage:
Scottish Blackface
The Scottish Blackface is the most common breed of domestic sheep in the United Kingdom. This tough and adaptable breed is often found in the more exposed locations, such as the Scottish Highlands or roaming on the moors of Dartmoor. It is also known as Blackfaced Highland, Kerry, Linton, Scottish Mountain, Scottish Highland, Scotch Blackface and Scotch Horn. 
 
Blackfaces are horned in both sexes, and as their name suggests, they usually have a black face (but sometimes with white markings), and black legs.   This breed is primarily raised for meat. 

History

The origins of the breed are uncertain. It was developed on the Anglo-Scottish border but it is not clear exactly when it became a distinct breed. It replaced the earlier Scottish Dunface or Old Scottish Short-wool, a Northern European short-tailed sheep type probably similar to the modern Shetland. 

Records show that in 1503 James IV of Scotland established a flock of 5,000 Scottish Blackface Sheep in Ettrick Forest in the area south of Peebles in the Borders.

Today the Blackface is the most numerous breed in the British Isles.  Roughly thirty percent of all sheep in the UK are Scottish Blackface. The Blackface epitomises the mountain sheep. They have long coarse wool that shields them from moisture and biting winds. They are able to survive the harshest winters in the most extreme parts of Great Britain. 

Several types of Scottish Blackface have developed over the years, but the most common are the Perth variety, which is large framed, with a longer coat, and mainly found in north-east Scotland, Devon, Cornwall and Northern Ireland, and the medium-framed Lanark type, with shorter wool, commonly found in Scotland and Ireland. 

The introduction of Black Faced Highland sheep to America  first occurred in June, 1861, Hugh Brodie imported one ram and two ewes for Brodie & Campbell, New York Mills, New York. In 1867 this flock and  increase was purchased by T. L. Harison of Morley, St. Lawrence County, New York. Isaac Stickney of New York also imported a small flock about 1867 for his farm in Illinois.

Blackface ewes are excellent mothers and will often attempt to defend their lambs against predators.  They are good milkers and are able to yield a lamb crop and a wool clip even when on marginal pastures. The breed spread from the border areas during the 19th century to the highlands and the Scottish islands. They also crossed to Northern Ireland and the US. There are flocks scattered across the USA but this robust little breed has remained a minor breed in North America. Blackface lambs yield a carcass ideal for the modern consumer. The meat is free of superfluous fat and waste and is known the world over for its distinct flavour. Although they are not large sheep they have enormous potential for the production of high quality lean lamb for today's health conscious consumer. There has never been a case of natural occurring Scrapie in a Scottish Blackface Sheep. In a controlled study in the UK goats and Blackface where infected by researchers but there is not one documented case of naturally spread scrapie in a Blackface raised in the USA or the UK. Scrapie, an invariably fatal disease of sheep and goats, is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). The putative infectious agent is the host-encoded prion protein, PrP.

Scottish Blackface wool

Scottish Blackface wool is a speciality wool in a class of its own. There are variations in type of fleece according to the way the sheep were bred. In general, there are a southwest type (short wool) and a central Scotland type (long wool). The southwest type is the finer, with a Bradford count of forty or so, generally classed as short or medium: ewe's fleece of 3 to 4½ lb, greasy. The central type is a stronger wool classed as long or deep strong; this type gives a ewe fleece of 5 to 6½ lb, greasy. The main markets are the mattress and upholstery trade, carpet and heavy cloth trade. Strong Blackface wool undoubtedly makes the best mattress filling there is: the demand for this is very good. The carpet trade all over the world (even New Zealand and Australia) uses large quantities of the medium class of Scottish Blackface wool.
The finer wools are used for blending into many of the strong wearing clothes, over-coating,working tweeds and heavy blankets, The finest Scottish Blackface wool goes to the famous Harris tweed trade.
 
The [http://www.sheepusa.org American Sheep Industry Association] reports an average fibre diameter of 38 to 28 micrometres (or microns), and staple length of 10 to. 

Artisans have long treasured the horns of the Blackface for the carving of shepherd's crooks and walking sticks. In the US the fleeces are becoming of interest to fibre artists and hand spinners for use in tapestry and the making of rugs and saddle blankets.

Scottish Blackface is a breed of which animal?

Passage:
Stompie Moeketsi
James Seipei (1974–1989), also known as Stompie Moeketsi, was a teenage United Democratic Front (UDF) activist from Parys in South Africa. He and three other boys were kidnapped on 29 December 1988 by members of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, known as the Mandela United football club. Moeketsi was murdered on 1 January 1989, the only one of the boys to be killed. 

Activism

Moeketsi joined the street uprising against apartheid in the mid-1980s at age ten, and soon took on a leading role. He became the country's youngest political detainee when he spent his 12th birthday in jail without trial.  At the age of 13 he was expelled from school.

Murder

Moeketsi, together with Kenny Kgase, Pelo Mekgwe and Thabiso Mono, were kidnapped on 29 December 1988 from the Methodist manse in Orlando, Soweto. Moeketsi was accused of being a police informer and after the 4 boys were kidnapped they were pleading and saying that Stompie isn't a police informer. Jerry Richardson, one of the members of Winnie Mandela's Football Club, was carrying a samurai-like sword before he closed the door and screams were heard as Stompie Moeketsi was murdered at the age of 14. His body was found on waste ground near Winnie Mandela's house on 6 January 1989, and recovered by the police. His throat had been cut. Jerry Richardson, one of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, was convicted of the murder. He claimed that she had ordered him, with others, to abduct the four youths from Soweto, of whom Moeketsi was the youngest. The four were severely beaten.

Involvement of Winnie Mandela

In 1991, Winnie Mandela was convicted of kidnapping and being an accessory to assault,  but her six-year jail sentence was reduced to a fine and a two-year suspended sentence on appeal. In 1992 she was accused of ordering the murder of Dr. Abu-Baker Asvat, a family friend who had examined Seipei at Mandela's house, after Seipei had been abducted but before he had been killed.  Mandela's role was later probed as part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, in 1997.  She was said to have paid the equivalent of $8,000 and supplied the firearm used in the killing, which took place on 27 January 1989.  The hearings were later adjourned amid claims that witnesses were being intimidated on Winnie Mandela's orders. 

This incident became a cause célèbre for the apartheid government and opponents of the ANC, and Winnie Mandela's iconic status was dealt a heavy blow.

Appearing before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1997, she said allegations that she was involved in at least 18 human rights abuses including eight murders were ""ridiculous"" and claimed that her main accuser, former comrade Katiza Cebekhulu, was a former ""mental patient"" and his allegations against her were ""hallucinations"".  The Commission found that the abduction had been carried out on Winnie Mandela's instructions, and that she had ""initiated and participated in the assaults"". However, with regard to the actual murder the Commission found Mandela only ""negligent"".

Which famous name was accused f the abduction of Stompie Seipei?

Passage:
Mens sana in corpore sano
Mens sana in corpore sano is a Latin phrase, usually translated as ""a sound mind in a sound body"" or ""a healthy mind in a healthy body"".

In the western world, the phrase is widely used in sporting and educational contexts to express the theory that physical exercise is an important or essential part of mental and psychological well-being.

History

The phrase comes from Satire X of the Roman poet Juvenal (10.356).  It is the first in a list of what is desirable in life:

Traditional commentators believe that Juvenal's intention was to teach his fellow Roman citizens that in the main, their prayers for such things as long life are misguided. That the gods had provided man with virtues which he then lists for them.

Over time and separated from its context, the phrase has come to have a range of meanings.  It can be construed to mean that only a healthy mind can lead to a healthy body, or equally that only a healthy body can produce or sustain a healthy mind.  Its most general usage is to express the hierarchy of needs: with physical and mental health at the root.

An earlier, similar saying is attributed to the pre-Socratic philosopher Thales:

τίς εὐδαίμων, ""ὁ τὸ μὲν σῶμα ὑγιής, τὴν δὲ ψυχὴν εὔπορος, τὴν δὲ φύσιν εὐπαίδευτος""
What man is happy? ""He who has a healthy body, a resourceful mind and a docile nature.""

Leprechauns are a type of fairy, though it's important to note that the fairies of Irish folklore were not cute Disneyfied pixies; they could be lustful, nasty, capricious creatures whose magic might delight you one day and kill you the next if you displeased them.
Leprechauns are often described as wizened, bearded old men dressed in green (early versions were clad in red) and wearing buckled shoes, often with a leather apron. Sometimes they wear a pointed cap or hat and may be smoking a pipe.
Leprechaun lore
In their book ""The Element Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures,"" John and Caitlin Matthews trace leprechaun legends back to eighth-century legends of water spirits called ""luchorpán,"" meaning small body. These sprites eventually merged with a mischievous household fairy said to haunt cellars and drink heavily.
Other researchers say that the word leprechaun may be derived from the Irish leath bhrogan, meaning shoemaker. Indeed, though leprechauns are often associated with riches and gold, in folklore their main vocation is anything but glamorous: they are humble cobblers, or shoemakers. Shoemaking is apparently a lucrative business in the fairy world, since each leprechaun is said to have his own pot of gold, which can often be found at the end of a rainbow.
According to Irish legends, people lucky enough to find a leprechaun and capture him (or, in some stories, steal his magical ring, coin or amulet) can barter his freedom for his treasure. Leprechauns are usually said to be able to grant the person three wishes. But dealing with leprechauns can be a tricky proposition.
A trickster
The leprechaun plays several roles in Irish folklore; he is principally a roguish trickster figure who cannot be trusted and will deceive whenever possible. In her encyclopedia ""Spirits, Fairies, Leprechauns, and Goblins,"" folklorist Carol Rose offers a typical tale of leprechaun trickery ""concerning a man who managed to get a leprechaun to show him the bush in the field where his treasure was located. Having no spade [shovel], the man marked the tree with one of his red garters, then kindly released the sprite and went for a spade. Returning almost instantly he found that every one of the numerous trees in the field sported a red garter!""
In the magical world, most spirits, fairies and other creatures have a distinctive sound that is associated with them. Some entities — such as the Irish fairy banshee and the Hispanic spirit La Llorona — are said to emit a mournful wail signifying their presence. In the case of the leprechaun, it's the tap-tap-tapping of his tiny cobbler hammer, driving nails into shoes, that announces they are near.
In his collection of Irish fairy and folk tales, W.B. Yeats offered an 18th-century poem by William Allingham titled ""The Lepracaun; Or, Fairy Shoemaker"" which describes the sound:
""Lay your ear close to the hill.
Do you not catch the tiny clamour,
Busy click of an elfin hammer,
Voice of the Lepracaun singing shrill
As he merrily plies his trade?""
The 1825 publication of a book called ""Fairy Legends"" seemingly cemented the character of the modern leprechaun: ""Since that time leprechauns seem to be entirely male and solitary,"" they note.
It seems that all leprechauns are not only shoemakers but also old male loners, which makes sense from a cultural standpoint, since that type of fairy is so closely associated with shoemaking, a traditionally male vocation. Though there is something curious about all leprechauns being cobblers (what if they want to be writers, farmers, or doctors?), this designation also fits in well with the traditional folkloric division of labor among fairies.
Leprechauns in popular culture
As with many old legends and traditions, the image and nature of the leprechaun has changed over time and has been updated (and in some cases sanitized) for a modern audience. Lucky the Leprechaun, mascot of the General Mills breakfast cereal Lucky Charms, is probably the best-known fairy of his type.
On the other end of the spectrum there's the homicidal leprechaun Lubdan in the ""Leprechaun"" horror/comedy film series (played by ""Willow"" actor Warwick Davis). For generations, some Irish have been annoyed by leprechauns and the ethnic stereotypes they perpetuate, and for most Americans leprechauns only appear around St. Patrick's Day .
Leprechauns offer a morality tale figure whose fables warn against the folly of trying to get rich quick, take what's not rightfully yours or interfere with ""The Good Folk"" and other magical creatures. Belief in leprechauns and other fairies was once widespread on the Emerald Isle , and real or not they will continue to amuse and delight us for centuries more.

Lowell Observatory
Lowell Observatory is an astronomical observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, United States. Lowell Observatory was established in 1894, placing it among the oldest observatories in the United States, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.  In 2011, the Observatory was named one of ""The World's 100 Most Important Places"" by TIME. It was at the Lowell Observatory that the dwarf planet Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh.

The Observatory's original 24 in Alvan Clark & Sons Telescope is still in use today for public education. Lowell Observatory hosts 85,000 visitors per year at their Steele Visitors Center, who take guided daytime tours and view various wonders of the night sky through the Clark Telescope and other telescopes. It was founded by astronomer Percival Lowell of Boston's well-known Lowell family and is overseen by a sole trustee, a position historically handed down through the family. The first trustee was Lowell's third cousin Guy Lowell (1916–1927). Percival's nephew Roger Putnam served from 1927–1967, followed by Roger's son Michael (1967–1987), Michael's brother William Lowell Putnam III (1987–2013), and current trustee W. Lowell Putnam.

The observatory operates several telescopes at three locations in the Flagstaff area. The main facility, located on Mars Hill just west of downtown Flagstaff, houses the original 24 in Clark Refracting Telescope, although its role today is as a public education tool and not research. The telescope, built in 1896 for $20,000, was assembled in Boston by Alvan Clark & Sons and then shipped by train to Flagstaff. Also located on the Mars Hill campus is the 13 in Pluto Discovery Telescope, used by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 to discover the dwarf planet Pluto.

Lowell Observatory currently operates four research telescopes at its Anderson Mesa dark sky site, located 20 km southeast of Flagstaff, including the 72 in Perkins Telescope (in partnership with Boston University) and the 42 in John S. Hall Telescope. Lowell is a partner with the United States Naval Observatory and Naval Research Laboratory in the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) also located at that site. The Observatory also operates smaller research telescopes at its historic site on Mars Hill and in Australia and Chile.

Past Anderson Mesa, on the peak of Happy Jack, Lowell Observatory has also built and is commissioning the  Discovery Channel Telescope in partnership with Discovery Communications, Inc.

History (see discoveries below)

Aside from the wide array of research and discoveries listed below, one science program carried out at the Observatory was the measurement of the variability of solar irradiance.  When Harold L. Johnson took over as the director in 1952, the stated objective became to focus on light from the Sun reflecting from Uranus and Neptune. In 1953, the current 21 in telescope was erected. Beginning in 1954, this telescope began monitoring the brightness of these two planets, and comparing these measurements with a reference set of sunlike stars.

Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT)  

Lowell Observatory is building a major new reflecting telescope in partnership with Discovery Communications, located near Happy Jack, Arizona. This Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT), located within the Mogollon Rim Ranger District of the Coconino National Forest, is expected to be the fifth-largest telescope in the contiguous United States, and it will enable the astronomers of Lowell Observatory to enter new research areas deeper into outer space.

The DCT and the research carried out there will be the focus of ongoing informative and educational television programs about astronomy, the sciences, and technology to be telecast on the Discovery channels. The primary mirror of the Discovery Channel Telescope will be  in diameter. It will be supposely notable for its uncommon meniscus design for such a large mirror. This mirror was ground and polished into its parabolic shape at the Optical Fabrication and Engineering Facility of the College of Optical Sciences of the University of Arizona (in Tucson, Arizona).

Current research 

Lowell Observatory's astronomers conduct research on a wide range of solar system and astrophysical topics using ground-based, airborne, and space-based telescopes. Among the many current programs are a search for near-Earth asteroids, a survey of the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, a search for extrasolar planets, a decades-long study of the brightness stability of the sun, and a variety of investigations of star formation and other processes in distant galaxies. In addition, the Observatory staff designs and builds custom instrumentation for use on Lowell's telescopes and elsewhere. For example, Lowell staff built a sophisticated high-speed camera for use on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). SOFIA is a joint project of the United States and German space agencies and consists of a  telescope on board a Boeing 747 SP.

Notable discoveries 

*The dwarf planet Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930
*Large recessional velocities of galaxies by Vesto Melvin Slipher between 1912 and 1914 (that led ultimately to the realization our universe is expanding)
*Co-discovery of the rings of Uranus in 1977
*The periodic variation in the activity of Comet Halley during the 1985/1986 apparition 
*The three largest known stars

Tiergarten Schönbrunn
Tiergarten Schönbrunn (literally, ""Schönbrunn Zoo""), or ""Vienna Zoo"", is a zoo located on the grounds of the famous Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, Austria. Founded as an imperial menagerie in 1752, it is the oldest zoo in the world.
Today, Tiergarten Schönbrunn is considered and regards itself as a scientifically administered zoo which sees its main purpose as a centre for species conservation and general nature conservation as well as in the fulfillment of the education mandate given to it by the legislation. The still preserved buildings of the baroque era, which have been complemented in the last years by elements of modern zoo architecture, still convey a good impression of the 18th century menagerie-buildings after the Versailles model.

Description

Tiergarten Schönbrunn is one of the few zoos worldwide to house giant pandas.  The zoo's pandas are named Yang Yang (F), Long Hui (M), Fu Long (M), and Fu Hu (M).   Fu Long's birth on 23 August 2007 was the first natural insemination panda birth in Europe.   Fu Hu was born exactly 3 years later, and he was also conceived by natural mating.  One more panda cub, Fu Bao (福豹), was born nearly three years later on 14 August 2013 via natural mating. 

Other zoo attractions include a rainforest house, in which the spectator is led through a simulation of the Amazon rainforest, an aquarium, which enables  spectators to walk through underneath a simulation of the Amazon in flood, and, more recently, an exhibit of animals in unnatural habitats.  The new polarium for animals of the Arctic region was opened in early 2004.

On 14 July 1906, the zoo saw the birth of the first elephant in captivity. 

From its privatization in 1992, it has been led by Helmut Pechlaner, also president of WWF Austria, who managed to modernize most parts of the zoo and sustain its financial situation. Nowadays, as of 2014, the zoo is managed by Dagmar Schratter.

Private and corporate sponsorship for the various animals is one of the methods employed by the zoo today, along with bookable night excursions and special children's programs. Zoological research takes place at the zoo.

History

The zoo was constructed in 1752 next to Schloss Schönbrunn by Adrian van Stekhoven at the order of the then Holy Roman Emperor, Francis I, husband of Maria Theresia, to serve as an imperial menagerie. It was centered around a pavilion meant for imperial breakfasts. Therefore, thirteen animal enclosures in the form of cut cake pieces were established around this central pavilion.

The central pavilions and the menagerie building were built by Jean Nicolas Jadot de Ville-Issey. A small zoo had already existed on the premises since 1540, but the complex was opened to the public only in 1779. Initially, there were no entrance fees.

Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II organized expeditions to Africa and the Americas to procure specimens for the zoo. The arrival of the first giraffe in 1828 influenced Viennese fashion and city life. Clothes', accessories', and other items' designs were influenced, and Adolf Bäuerle performed his play titled Giraffes in Vienna ().

At the onset of World War I, the zoo was home to 712 species and 3,500 specimens. Due to diminishing food supplies during the war, the number of specimens rapidly sank to 900. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the war, the zoo became the responsibility of the Austrian Republic.

Bombing raids on February 19 and February 21, 1945, during World War II, had an even greater impact on the zoo. Many buildings were destroyed and specimens killed, reducing the stock of specimens to 400. The new zoo director, Dr. Julius Brachetka, eventually managed to restore the zoo.

The zoo experienced a financial crisis in the 1980s, but closure of the zoo was prevented by privatization in 1992. Dr. Helmut Pechlaner was assigned as manager of the zoo. After his retirement on 1 January 2007, his deputy, Dr. Dagmar Schratter, took over his post.

Pechlaner was able to renovate and extend many of the enclosures thanks to a number of sponsors and significantly increased entrance fees. During his time as manager, the zoo was extended by a number of new buildings, including the rainforest house, the desert house, and the ""Tyrolean farmhouse"". A number of rare and exotic specimens, such as giant pandas and koalas, were attracted to the zoo and contributed to its upswing in popularity.

In the media

A number of tragic accidents have plagued the zoo. In 2002, a jaguar attacked a caretaker during feeding, killing her in front of zoo visitors. The director tried to help and sustained heavy arm injuries. In February 2005, a young elephant, Abu, lethally crushed his caretaker. In the following press storm, director Pechlaner offered to resign over the issue. 

The zoo is a filming location for the ORF series, Tom Turbo, which is based on a series of children's books by Thomas Brezina. Tom Turbo has its garage at the zoo since 2006, and is, together with its creator, sponsor of a tiger at the zoo. Former zoo director Pechlaner makes cameo appearances in a number of episodes.

The 250 Years Vienna Zoo Silver Coin

The zoo is so popular and famous that on its 250th anniversary, it was the topic of one of the most famous silver collectors' coins: the 5 euro 250 Years of Vienna Zoo commemorative coin minted on 8 May 2002.

The reverse shows the Emperor's Pavilion surrounded by a variety of animals from the zoo. The dates 1752-2002 refer to the anniversary and, of course, date the coin itself.

Passage:
Five-spice powder
Five-spice powder is a spice mixture of five spices, used primarily in Chinese cuisine but also used in other Asian  and Arabic cookery.

Formula

While there are many variants, a common mix is: 
*Star anise (bajiao, 八角) 
*Cloves (dingxiang, 丁香)
*Chinese Cinnamon (rougui, 肉桂)
*Sichuan pepper (huajiao, 花椒)
*Fennel seeds (xiaohuixiang, 小茴香)
Other recipes may contain anise seed or ginger root, nutmeg, turmeric, Amomum villosum pods (砂仁),  Amomum cardamomum pods (白豆蔻), licorice, Mandarin orange peel or galangal. In South China Cinnamomum loureiroi and Mandarin orange peel is commonly used as a substitute for Cinnamomum cassia and cloves, respectively, producing a different flavour for southern five-spice powders.

Use

Five spice may be used with fatty meats such as pork, duck or goose. It is used as a spice rub for chicken, duck, pork and seafood, in red cooking recipes, or added to the breading for fried foods. Five spice is used in recipes for Cantonese roasted duck, as well as beef stew. It is used as a marinade for Vietnamese broiled chicken. The five-spice powder mixture has followed the Chinese diaspora and has been incorporated into other national cuisines throughout Asia.

Although this mixture is used in restaurant cooking, many Chinese households do not use it in day-to-day cooking.  In Hawaii, some restaurants place a shaker of the spice on each patron's table. A seasoned salt can be easily made by dry-roasting common salt with five-spice powder under low heat in a dry pan until the spice and salt are well mixed.

Singer
The first Singer cars - built under licence from Lea-Francis and designed by Alex Craig - were produced in 1905 by George Singer, who had worked for Coventry Machinists before producing cycle, tricycles and then cars.
Singer died a year after the company went into receivership (in 1908) and the firm was re-established as Singer and Co. (1909) Ltd.
Early models from the new business…
Overhead camshaft in-line four-cylinder 875cc Chamois: 39bhp; Chamois Sport: 51bhp
0-60 mph:
Chamois: 23.5 sec; Chamois Sport: 16+ sec
Top Speed:
Chamois: 80 mph; Chamois Sport: 90 mph
MPG:
Chamois: 35-45; Chamois Sport: 30-40+
A great little car, now rare but worth tracking down for its fine mix of fun, civility and classy looks. The Chamois was a luxury version of the Hillman Imp, with a plusher interior, better soundproofing and sporty instrumentation, plus jazzier exterior bright work. Introduced in late 1964, the upmarket newcomer was powered by the same rev-happy engine as used in the less expensive Hillman. For 1966, the excellent Singer Chamois Sport arrived using the same peppy Imp Sport spec, while there was even a coupe based upon the Sunbeam Stiletto. For 1969, the Chamois featured quadruple headlamps but range was killed off just a year later.

Passage:
Saussurea
Saussurea is a genus of about 300 species of flowering plants in the thistle tribe within the daisy family, native to cool temperate and arctic regions of Asia, Europe, and North America, with the highest diversity in alpine habitats in the Himalaya and central Asia. Common names include saw-wort and snow lotus, the latter used for a number of high altitude species in central Asia.

They are perennial herbaceous plants, ranging in height from dwarf alpine species 5–10 cm tall, to tall thistle-like plants up to 3 m tall. The leaves are produced in a dense basal rosette, and then spirally up the flowering stem. The flowers form in a dense head of small capitula, often surrounded by dense white to purple woolly hairs; the individual florets are also white to purple. The wool is densest in the high altitude species, and aid in thermoregulation of the flowers, minimising frost damage at night, and also preventing ultraviolet light damage from the intense high altitude sunlight.

De Candolle named the genus after Horace-Bénédict de Saussure (1740-1799) and Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure (1767–1845). 

Uses

A number of the high alpine Himalayan species are grown as ornamental plants for their decorative dense woolly flowerheads; they are among the most challenging plants to grow, being adapted to harsh climates from 3500–5000 m altitude, demanding cool temperatures, a very long (up to 8–10 months) winter rest period, and very good soil drainage in humus-rich gravel soils.

Traditional uses 

Costi amari radix or costus root was an important item of Roman trade with India, and is believed to have been the dried root of Saussurea lappa. 

Several varieties of snow lotus are used in traditional Tibetan medicine. Saussurea lappa is used a component of the traditional Tibetan medicine Padma 28.  Research conducted on the Himalayan medicinal plants by C.P. Kala reveals that the practitioners of Tibetan medicine living in the Pin Valley of Himachal Pradesh use its root for curing dysentery and ulcer.  Saussurea involucrata flowers and stems have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, cough with cold, stomachache, dysmenorrhea, and altitude sickness, and has been found to have antiinflammatory, cardiotonic, abortifacient, anticancer, and antifatigue actions. 

Saussurea obvallata, known as ""brahmakamala"" in India is one of the most sacred species, and it has been used for offerings to goddess Nanda Devi for time immemorial.  

Pharmacology

Saussurea lappa and has been shown to inhibit the mRNA expression of iNOS by lipopolysaccharide stimulated macrophages, thus reducing nitric oxide production.  In rats, high doses of 50-200 milligrams per kilogram of crude ethanolic extract reduced observed inflammation in standard laboratory tests, and 25-100 milligrams per kilogram of the sesquiterpene fraction of the extract reduced several molecular markers of inflammation.    Ethanol extracts were shown to have analgesic and antiinflammatory effects at high doses of 75-300 milligrams per kilogram.  As the slow-growing wild plant is endangered by collections, a substitute grown in tissue culture has been suggested, which is mostly equivalent.  Generally the analgesic and antiinflammatory effects of the plant are much inferior to those of 10 milligrams of indomethacin.

Literature and culture

In most Chinese martial arts literature, the snow Lotus was classified a rare herb as precious as lingzhi mushroom, and old ginseng.

HOME » Useful Resources » Ports in Japan
  Ports from Japan
There are 1020 ports in Japan, 22 of which are main ports of special purpose, 106 main ports and 892 local ports.
Most frequently port-managing organizations are city municipalities (395 ports) or prefecture administrations (619 ports). The development of most significant for economics Japanese ports is financed 2/3 by government means; the remaining part is financed by port-managing organizations. Ministry of land infrastructure and transport in Japan can provide with stock capital for the securities that are issued by port-managing organizations if the project that is being carried into effect is important on the state scale. Port managing organizations prepare port development plans.
City municipalities accomplish territorial planning. Port territory utilization, change of purpose or assimilation of new territories is always foreseen in the city detailed plan. Port investment projects are estimated on the economic aspect, most frequently without financial estimation. The aim is not to gain profit from the port activity but broader influence on the economy while estimating the relationship between costs and profit. Impressive projects are being put into practice in all visited ports:
1. In Kobe port the whole activity is concentrated on made-up islands, i.e. Port Island (the beginning of formation the year 1965 - the first in Japan) and Rokko Island (1982). The territories between piers situated in the old port on the coast are strewed forming new territories that are generally of non-industrial purpose: office buildings, parks, and dwelling houses. The state invests in the main infrastructure, breakwaters, capital dredging, greatest berths; the city - generally in the formation of territory, berths, covers, cranes that load cargo to the ships.
2. Osaka port develops similarly as in Kobe port (as well as the other major ports - Tokyo, Jokohama): large islands are formed that are used for both port activity and other purposes (entertainments, business and dwelling districts). Contracts concerning the usage of new terminals are signed before the construction works. Tenders are organized where the members of the commission are the representatives of ministries, city and educational institutions. For example, in the case of the terminal that was visited, the winner has become the only one participant (Evergreen), that later invested in the cranes mounted on container reloading sites. Length of berth of the terminal - 300 m, depth of the territory (maximum distance from the berth) 600 m.
3. Tokyo astonishes with its extensive port development scale: 300 billion yens are invested in the protective berths of one island, it is planned to increase the port island up to 400 hectares.

Why does the poet say that triumph and disaster are two imposters in the poem ""If"" by Rudyard Kipling?

Posted on
Over the Wimbledon Tennis court tunnel which takes the players back to the locker room  is this phrase:
If you can meet with Triumph and disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same.
What a wonderful poem! It is one of the most beloved poems in literature, and its message is timeless. In the poem, “If,”  Rudyard Kipling gives advice to his son on how to become a man; yet his advice rings true for everyone.
This poem is labeled a didactic poem because its purpose is to teach.  In each stanza, Kipling provides guidance in some aspect of life.
The first stanza covers building self-confidence, never giving up, not judging other people too harshly, being patient, and loving not hating.
In the second stanza, the poet’s instructions include always dreaming, using his  intelligence, and ignoring fools. 
The two lines above the Wimbledon tunnel are found in stanza 2.What do the these lines mean? Triumph  signifies  winning, victory, success, and achievement.Those words are easy to live with.   However, as the adage states, Winning is not everything.  If a person does win a tennis match, the spelling bee, the beauty pageant--never boast  but show sportsmanship toward the fellow competitors.  Doing the best a person can do is winning no matter what the outcome.
On the other hand, disaster brings a different set of circumstances: tragedy, adversity, loving, misfortune, and defeat.  Not situations that anyone finds comforting.  With this idea comes losing with grace, remembering that he did the best he could do--  then there is no loser.
Kipling does personify these words.  Personification ascribes human qualities to something.  Here these two aspects of life are given the ability to be imposters.  They are pretenders because both situations  are fleeting [They do not last!] Winning is great, but it is only temporary.  Thankfully, disaster is momentary as well. Everyone wants to win,  and nobody wants to lose. It is the grace that one shows in either situation that makes these imposters ludicrous.
Remember that the  tennis players know both triumph when they  win, and disaster when they  lose.  There is only one winner and many losers. Each year, the athletes keep coming back to play the game that they love. These people know that it is not whether you lose or win, it is how you play the game.  Kipling ends his poem with this  assurance:
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And---which is more---you'll be a Man, my son!

Question:
In his poem ‘If’, what does Kipling describe as ‘those two impostors’?
Answer:
TRIUMPH and DISASTER
Passage:
Interrobang
The interrobang (), also known as the interabang,  ‽ (often represented by ?! or !?), is a nonstandard punctuation mark used in various written languages and intended to combine the functions of the question mark (also called the ""interrogative point"")  and the exclamation mark or exclamation point (known in printers' and programmers' jargon as the ""bang"").  The glyph is a superimposition of these two marks. The word itself is an example of a portmanteau that incorporates an onomatopoeia.

Application

A sentence ending with an interrobang asks a question in an excited manner, expresses excitement or disbelief in the form of a question, or asks a rhetorical question.

For example:  
* You call that a hat‽
* You're pregnant‽

In informal English, the same inflection is usually notated by ending a sentence with first a question mark and then an exclamation mark, or vice versa. Many people are unfamiliar with the interrobang, and would be puzzled when first seeing it, although its intention is usually self-evident. The interrobang can be hand-written with a single stroke plus the dot. One common application is in cartoons, as a stand-alone symbol of surprise.

History

 

Many writers, especially in informal writing, have used multiple punctuation marks to end a sentence expressing surprise and question.

What the...?! Neves, Called Dead in Fall, Denies It (headline from San Francisco Examiner, May 9, 1936)

Writers using informal language may use several alternating question marks and exclamation marks for even more emphasis:

He did what?!?!?!
Like multiple exclamation marks and multiple question marks, such strings count as poor style in formal writing. 

The combinations ""!?"" and ""?!"" are also used to express judgements of particular chess moves through their use as punctuation in chess annotation. ""!?"" denotes an ""interesting"" move, while ""?!"" denotes a ""dubious"" move.

Invention

American Martin K. Speckter conceptualized the interrobang in 1962. As the head of an advertising agency, Speckter believed that advertisements would look better if copywriters conveyed surprised rhetorical questions using a single mark. He proposed the concept of a single punctuation mark in an article in the magazine TYPEtalks. Speckter solicited possible names for the new character from readers. Contenders included exclamaquest, QuizDing,  rhet, and exclarotive, but he settled on interrobang. He chose the name to reference the punctuation marks that inspired it: interrogatio is Latin for ""a rhetorical question"" or ""cross-examination"";  bang is printers' slang for the exclamation mark. Graphic treatments for the new mark were also submitted in response to the article.Haley, Allan. 

Early interest

In 1966, Richard Isbell of American Type Founders issued the Americana typeface and included the interrobang as one of the characters. In 1968, an interrobang key was available on some Remington typewriters. During the 1970s, one could buy replacement interrobang keycaps and typefaces for some Smith-Corona typewriters. 
The interrobang was in vogue for much of the 1960s, with the word interrobang appearing in some dictionaries and the mark itself featuring in magazine and newspaper articles.

Continued support

Although most fonts do not include the interrobang, it has not disappeared: Lucida Grande, the default font for many UI elements of legacy versions of Apple's OS X operating system, includes the interrobang, and Microsoft provides several versions of the interrobang character as part of the Wingdings 2 character set (on the right bracket and tilde keys on US keyboard layouts) available with Microsoft Office.  It was accepted into Unicode  and is present in several fonts, including Lucida Sans Unicode, Arial Unicode MS, and Calibri, the default font in the Office 2007, 2010 and 2013 suites. 

Inverted interrobang

A reverse and upside down interrobang (combining ¿ and ¡, Unicode character: ⸘), suitable for starting phrases in Spanish, Galician and Asturian, which use inverted question and exclamation marks, is called an ""inverted interrobang"" or a gnaborretni (interrobang written backwards).  In current practice, interrobang-like emphatic ambiguity in Hispanic languages is usually achieved by including both sets of punctuation marks one inside the other (¿¡Verdad!? or ¡¿Verdad?! [Really!?]).  Older usage, still official but not widespread, recommended mixing the punctuation marks: ¡Verdad? or ¿Verdad! 

Entering and display

The interrobang is not a standard punctuation mark. Few modern typefaces or fonts include a glyph for the interrobang character. The standard interrobang is at Unicode code point .  The inverted interrobang is at Unicode code point .  Single-character versions of the double-glyph versions are also available at code points  and .

The interrobang can be used in some word processors with the alt code  when working in a font that supports the interrobang, or using an operating system that performs font substitution.

Depending on the browser and which fonts the user has installed, some of these may or may not be displayed or may be substituted with a different font.

On a Linux system supporting the Compose Key, an interrobang can be produced by pressing the compose key followed by the exclamation point and the question mark; reversing the order creates the inverted interrobang.  On Mac OS X, it is found on the Character Palette, obtained by pressing the key combination .

The interrobang can be displayed in LaTeX by using the package textcomp and the command \textinterrobang. The inverted interrobang is also provided for in the textcomp package through the command \textinterrobangdown.

Prominent uses

The State Library of New South Wales, New South Wales, Australia, uses an interrobang as its logo,  as does educational publishing company Pearson, who intend it to convey ""the excitement and fun of learning"". 

Chief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook used an interrobang in the 2012 Seventh Circuit opinion Robert F. Booth Trust v. Crowley.

Passage:
Spraint
Spraint is the dung of the otter. 

Spraints are typically identified by smell and are known for their distinct aromas, the smell of which has been described as ranging from freshly mown hay to putrefied fish.  The European otter's spraints are black and slimy,  long and deposited in groups of up to four in prominent locations near water. They contain scales, shells and bones of water creatures.  Because of the decline of otters in Britain, several surveys have been made to record the distribution of the animal, usually by recording the presence of spraint.
  Further, there is some evidence that spraint density is correlated with otter density.
Question:
Finding its spraint means what animal has been there?

Ace Payroll: Christmas and New Year 2016/2017
Ace Payroll: Christmas and New Year 2016/2017
Christmas and New Year 2016/2017
Christmas Day is on Sunday 25th December 2016 and Boxing Day is Monday 26th December 2016.
New Years Day is Sunday 1st January 2017, with the day after being Monday 2nd January 2017.
If Sunday is a normal working day for an employee, then the Sunday is a public holiday for that employee.
If the employee does not usually work on a Sunday, then the following Tuesday becomes a public holiday.
To check the dates in future years, see the Public Holiday Calendar FAQ.
See Also
Christmas and New Year 2012/2013
The following is the advice from the Employment Relations Service.
If the holiday falls on a weekend, and your employee doesn't normally work on the weekend, the holiday is transferred to the following Monday or Tuesday so that the employee still gets a paid day off.
If the holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday and the employee normally works on that day, then the holiday remains at the traditional day and the employee is entitled to that day off on pay.
An employee cannot be entitled to more than four public holidays over the Christmas and New Year period, regardless of his or her work pattern.
Christmas and New Year's Day this year fall on a Sunday.  I understand that in this case, Tuesday becomes the public holiday.  In my business, the staff work on all three of these days.  Do I have to pay them time and a half for the Sunday, or the Monday and Tuesday, or all three?
First, determine which of the days would be a normal working day for the employee if it were not Christmas. Once determined, the following applies
If the same staff member usually works all three days, Sunday are Monday are the public holidays. For working those two days you pay time and a half, plus allow the two alternative holidays. For them, Tuesday is not a public holiday.
If a staff member works just the Sunday and Monday, or just the Monday and Tuesday, then in both these cases, both days are public holidays. Pay time and a half and allow a day in lieu for each day worked.
If an employee usually works just the Sunday and Tuesday, then only the Sunday is a public holiday. The Tuesday is not a public holiday for this employee, because the Tuesday only becomes a public holiday if the employee does not usually work on the Sunday.
If an employee would only usually work one of the days between Sunday and Tuesday, then irrespective of which day it is, it is to be treated as a public holiday.
This is covered by Section 45 which has changed the handling of the four public holidays at Christmas and New Year.
Section 45
Transfer of public holidays over Christmas and New Year
(1)  For the purposes of this subpart, if any of the public holidays listed in section 44(1)(a) to (d) (christmas and new year)
(a)  falls on a Saturday and the day would otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on that day:
(b)  falls on a Saturday and the day would not otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on the following Monday:
(c)  falls on a Sunday and the day would otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on that day:
(d)  falls on a Sunday and the day would not otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on the following Tuesday.
(2)  To avoid doubt, this section does not entitle an employee to more than 4 public holidays for the days listed in section 44(1)(a) to (d) (christmas and new year).
What this section effectively says is
If the Christmas or New Year holidays fall on a Saturday or Sunday, and the employee normally works on a Saturday or Sunday, then the Saturday or Sunday are public holidays.
If an employee does not usually work on the Saturday or Sunday, then the public holidays are the following Monday or Tuesday.
My employee works Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  We are closing on Sunday - Christmas Day but will be working every other day. What does the employee get?
Your employee normally works Sunday, but not Monday or Tuesday.
Therefore the Monday and Tuesday days are irrelevant.
They are not working on Sunday because you are closed. Therefore the employee takes that day as a public holiday, and gets paid what they would normally earn on that day.
Public Holidays In Ace Payroll
To pay an employee for a public holiday, from the Pay Calculation screen click Leave , then select either Public Holiday Taken or Public Holiday Worked.
For every employee, there are only three possibilities
Public Holiday Taken
Select this option if the employee did not work on the public holiday, but would have worked had the day not been a public holiday.
For detailed documentation, see the Public Holiday Taken FAQ.
Public Holiday Worked
For detailed documentation, see the Public Holiday Worked FAQ.
Not Entitled To Public Holiday
If the public holiday falls on a day that would not otherwise have been a working day for the employee, do nothing.
The employee is not entitled to any sort of payment in these circumstances.

If Christmas Day falls on a Tuesday, on what day will New Year's Day fall?

","[""Childe Harold's""]",12408,triviaqa,en,,d1c7310c2d98d1f1851de8cbdc17064a3a09329496c39233," The Scottish Blackface is the most common breed of domestic sheep in the UK. It is also known as Blackfaced Highland, Kerry, Linton, Scottish Mountain, Scottish Highland, Scotch Blackface and Scotch Horn. Blackfaces are horned in both sexes, and as their name suggests, they usually have a black face (but sometimes with white markings), and black legs. The origins of the breed are uncertain. It was developed on the Anglo-Scottish border but it is not clear exactly when it became a distinct breed. The Blackface epitomises the mountain sheep. They have long coarse wool that shields them from moisture and biting winds. They are able to survive the harshest winters in the most extreme parts of Great Britain. Blackface lambs yield a carcass ideal for the modern consumer. The meat is free of superfluous fat and waste and is known the world over for its distinct flavour. Although they are not large sheep they have enormous potential for the production of high quality lean lamb for today's health conscious consumer. There is not one documented case of naturally spread scrapie in a Blackface raised in the USA or UK. The main markets are the mattress and carpet trade, carpet and heavy cloth trade. The Perth variety is large framed, with a longer coat, and mainly found in north-east Scotland, Devon, Cornwall and Northern Ireland. The medium-framed Lanark type, with shorter wool, commonly found in Scotland and Ireland, is commonly found. The southwest type is the finer, with an ewe's fleece of 3 to 4½ lb, greasy, and classed as 5 6½lb. The central type gives a fleece that is classed up to 6½½lb, and gives a strong wool as deep as deep or strong. There are a southwest type (short wool) and a central Scotland type (long wool). The main market is Strong Blaisdell, where the main trade is mattress and cloth trade, carpentry and heavy wool. The most common type of Blackface sheep is the Perth variety, which has a large framed coat and is found in the Scottish Highlands and Devon. It's the most numerous breed in the British Isles. The breed is primarily raised for meat. Stompie Moeketsi was a teenage United Democratic Front (UDF) activist from Parys in South Africa. He and three other boys were kidnapped on 29 December 1988 by members of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, known as the Mandela United football club. He was murdered on 1 January 1989, the only one of the boys to be killed. The incident became a cause célèbre for the apartheid government and opponents of the ANC. In 1992 she was accused of ordering the murder of Dr. Abu-Baker Asvat, a family friend who had examined Seipei at Mandela's house, after he had been abducted. She was said to have paid the equivalent of $8,000 and supplied the firearm used in the killing, which took place on 27 January 1989. In 1991 she was convicted of kidnapping and being an accessory to assault, but her six-year jail sentence was reduced to a fine and a two-year suspended sentence on appeal. In 1997, she said allegations that she was involved in at least 18 human rights abuses including eight murders were ""ridiculous"" and claimed her main accuser was a former ""mental patient and former patient"" The Commission found that abduction had been carried out on her instructions, and that she had ""initiated and participated in the assaults"" However, with regard to the actual murder, the Commission found the only ""ligent"" to Mandela was the fact that she only ""negligently participated"" in the assault and abduction of her former patient, Katiza Cebekhulu, who was a mental patient and ex-mental patient, as well as her husband, Nelson Mandela, and their children, Mandela's grandchildren and great-grandchildren. In the US the fleeces are becoming of interest to fibre artists and hand spinners for use in tapestry and the making of rugs and saddle blankets. The finest Scottish Blackface wool goes to the famous Harris tweed trade. The carpet trade all over the world (even New Zealand and Australia) uses large quantities of the medium class of Scottish Black face wool. The average fibre diameter of 38 to 28 micrometres (or microns), and staple length of 10 to. 14 microns, is used for blending into many of the strong wearing clothes, over-coating, working tweeds and heavy blankets. The phrase comes from Satire X of the Roman poet Juvenal (10.356) It is the first in a list of what is desirable in life. It can be construed to mean that only a healthy mind can lead to a healthy body. It is also used to express the theory that physical exercise is an important or essential part of mental and psychological well-being. The phrase appears in stone on the entrance to the HPER at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. It has also been used as the motto of the Royal Marines physical training instructors (PTI) in the U.S. and the Carlton Football Club in London. It also appears in the name of the University College London Men's Rugby Football Club, based out of the Bloomsbury in London, and the St James' Park Rugby Club in New York City. It was used in the book Some Thoughts Concerning Education by Heinrich von Treitschke (1632–1704) in which he outlines his doctrine of the German nationalistic doctrine. He uses the phrase to highlight a sound principle of his German nationalist doctrine, which echoes the principles of late 19th century Prussian society. He also used the phrase in his book The Army, which was published in 1704. It's also used as a motto of military institutions, such as the Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia, which is part of the Army Physical Training Corps (APTC) The phrase is used to refer to physical and mental health at the root of the hierarchy of needs: with physical and mentally healthy needs at the top of the list. It may also refer to the importance of physical activity in a person's daily life, or to the benefits it can bring to his or her physical and psychological health. The most common use of the phrase is to describe the benefits of physical exercise in the long term. It comes from Juvenal's list of virtues: ""What man is happy? He who has a good body, a resourceful mind and a docile nature."" The phrase has been used to describe physical activity and physical health in the past, as well as to describe mental health and physical fitness in the short-term, and in the future, as part of a healthy lifestyle. It means ""a sound mind in a sound body"" or ""a healthy body in a good state of mind"" or, more recently, ""a good body and a good mind in good health"" The phrase also appears on the front of a number of buildings in the United States, including the White House, the State University of New York and the University of California, Los Angeles. Leprechauns are a type of fairy, though it's important to note that the fairies of Irish folklore were not cute Disneyfied pixies. They could be lustful, nasty, capricious creatures whose magic might delight you one day and kill you the next if you displeased them. The sports equipment company Asics takes its name from an acronym of a variant: ""anima sana in corpore sano"" 'a healthy soul in a healthy body' The word leprechaun may be derived from the Irish leath bhrogan, meaning shoemaker. In folklore their main vocation is anything but glamorous: they are humble cobblers, or shoemakers. The phrase was a favorite of Harry S. Truman former President of the United States of America. It was also used as a line in the school song of Bangor Grammar School, in Bangor, County Down, Northern Ireland. It is used as the title of the television programme Holby City broadcast on 9 July 2013, and as a motto for fictional ""Blackwood Pines Sanatorium"" in the 2015 video game Until Dawn. It has also been used in a dialogue by Utpal Dutta in th movie ""Agantuk"" directed/screenplay by Satyajit Ray. It's also the motto for Sound Body Sound Mind, a United States nonprofit organization (501(c)(3) that promotes self-confidence and healthy lifestyle choices among children. In her encyclopedia ""Spirits, Fairies, and Goblins,"" LepreChauns, and folklorist Carlins, are called Leprechloristo, Lepre Chauns and Carlins. The word Lepre chaun is a roguish trickster figure who cannot be trusted and will deceive whenever possible. He is said to have his own pot of gold, which can often be found at the end of a rainbow. In some stories, people lucky enough to find a lepre chaun and capture him can steal his magical ring to gain his freedom for his treasure. He can also grant the person three wishes, which are usually said to be three wishes for the person dealing with him. He has a reputation for being difficult to deal with, and can be a tricky proposition to get along with. He's often described as wizened, bearded old men dressed in green (early versions were clad in red) and wearing buckle shoes, often with a leather apron. The 1825 publication of a book called ""Fairy Legends"" cemented the character of the modern leprechaun. Lucky the Leprechaun, mascot of the General Mills breakfast cereal Lucky Charms, is probably the best-known fairy of his type. For generations, some Irish have been annoyed by lepreChauns and the ethnic stereotypes they perpetuate. For most Americans lepre chauns only appear around St. Patrick's Day.. The image and nature of the lepre Chaun has changed over time and has been updated (and in some cases sanitized) for a modern audience.

It was at the Lowell Observatory that the dwarf planet Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh. The Lowell Observatory hosts 85,000 visitors per year at their Visitors Center, who take guided daytime tours and view the wonders of the sky through the Clark & Sons Telescope and other telescopes. The Observatory was named one of ""The World's 100 Most Important Places"" by TIME in 2011. The album was released in 1995 on Wildcard / Polydor Records. It has sold more than 1,000,000 copies in the U.S. and over 1.5 million in the UK. It is one of the best-selling albums of all time, with sales of over 1,500,000.

Nellie the elephant was named after an intelegent elephant who was brought to the circus by the owners of Hindustan. She packed her trunk and trumbled of to the jungle with a thrumety trump with a trumetytrump trump trump trump. She took a bow and she tooked a crowd by storm. She ran away from the circus and was never seen again. She is now living with her family in Flagstaff, Arizona, in a house built in the 1930s by the family of Percival Lowell, the first trustee of the observatory. The first trustee was Guy Lowell (1927–1916) and his nephew Roger putnam served from 1927–1967, followed by his son Michael (1967–1987), Michael's brother-in-law, and Guy's nephew, Guy Putnam's grandson, Guy Lowell, Jr. The couple have a son, Michael Putnam Jr., who was born in 1941. The observatory operates several telescopes at three locations in the Flagstaff area. The main facility, located on Mars Hill just west of downtown Flagstaff, houses the original 24 in Clark Refracting Telescope, built in 1896 for $20,000. Also located on the Mars Hill campus is the 13 in Pluto Discovery Telescope, used by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 to discover the dwarf planet Pluto. Lowell Observatory currently operates four research telescopes at its Anderson Mesa dark sky site, located 20 km southeast of Flagstaff. The observatory is building a major new reflecting telescope in partnership with Discovery Communications, located near Happy Jack, Arizona. Lowell is a partner with the United States Naval Observatory and Naval Research Laboratory in the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) also located at that site. Among the many current programs are a survey of the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, a search for extrasolar planets, a decades-long study of the brightness stability of the sun, and a variety of investigations of star formation and other processes in distant galaxies. In addition, the Observatory staff designs and builds custom instrumentation for use on Lowell's telescopes and elsewhere. For example, Lowell staff buililily builds custom instruments for use in the observatory. For more information about the Lowell Observatory, visit its official website or its official Facebook page. The Lowell Observatory is a non-profit organization that was established in 1903 by William Lowell Putnam III (1987–2013), and current trustee W. Lowell Putman III ( 1987–2013). It is based in Flagstaff and has offices in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and South Carolina. It is also based in Boston, Massachusetts, and in Chile, with offices in Sydney, Australia, and Santiago, Chile. The Observatory's astronomers conduct research on a wide range of solar system and astrophysical topics using ground-based, airborne, and space-based telescopes. It also conducts research on the variability of solar irradiance, including the search for near-Earth asteroids. Tiergarten Schönbrunn, or ""Vienna Zoo"", is a zoo located in Vienna, Austria. Founded as an imperial menagerie in 1752, it is the oldest zoo in the world. The zoo's pandas are named Yang Yang (F), Long Hui (M), Fu Long (M) and Fu Hu (M). Fu Long's birth on 23 August 2007 was the first natural insemination panda birth in Europe. A rainforest house, in which the spectator is led through a simulation of the Amazon rainforest, an aquarium, and, more recently, an exhibit of animals in unnatural habitats were opened in early 2004. On 14 July 1906, the zoo saw the birth of the first elephant in captivity. The still preserved buildings of the baroque era, which have been complemented in the last years by elements of modern zoo architecture, still convey a good impression of the 18th century menagersie-buildings after the Versailles model. Private and corporate sponsorship for the various animals is one of the methods employed by the zoo today, along with bookable night excursions and special children's programs. Zoological research takes place at the zoo. It is considered and regards itself as a scientifically administered zoo which sees its main purpose as a centre for species conservation and general nature conservation as well as in the fulfillment of the education mandate given to it by the legislation. It has been led by Helmut Pechlaner, also president of WWF Austria, since 1992, who managed to modernize most parts of the zoo and sustain its financial situation. The new polarium for animals of the Arctic region was opened in late 2004. The first giraffe arrived in Vienna in 1828 influenced by Viennese fashion and influenced by the city's fashion and life style. It was only there in 1740 but the public complex was only opened to the public in 1779. The current director is Dagmar Schratter, who is responsible for the zoo's day-to-day operations. The Zoo is located on the grounds of the famous Schön brunn Palace in Vienna. The main entrance to the zoo is at the entrance to Schloss Schön Brunn, which was built by the Holy Roman Emperor, Francis I, husband of Maria Theresia, in the 16th century. A small zoo had already existed on the premises since 1540. At the onset of World War I, the zoo was home to 712 species and 3,500 specimens. Due to diminishing food supplies during the war, the number of specimens rapidly sank to 900. Bombing raids on February 19 and February 21, 1945, during World War II, had an even greater impact on the zoo. A number of rare and exotic specimens, such as giant pandas and koalas, were attracted to the zoo and contributed to its upswing in popularity. The zoo is a filming location for the ORF series, Tom Turbo, which is based on a series of children's books by Thomas Brezina. On its 250th anniversary, it was the topic of one of the most famous silver collectors' coins: the 5 euro 250 Years of Vienna Zoo commemorative coin minted on 8 May 2002. The dates 1752-2002 refer to the anniversary and, of course, date the coin itself. The five-spice powder is a spice mixture of five spices, used primarily in Chinese cuisine but also used in other Asian  and Arabic cookery. It is used as a substitute for Cinnamum peel for chicken, duck, cassia and cloves, respectively, producing a different flavour for each dish. The 5- spice powder can also be used to create a variety of other spices, including ginger root, turmeric, Amomum pods, cloves, cloves and Chinese cinnamon. It can be found in China, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and the United States. It has been used in the film The Hobbit and the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, as well as in the TV series The Hobbit, Harry Potter, and the Indiana Jones and the Last Knight, among other films. The Five-Spice Powder is available on Amazon.com for about $20.00. The price includes shipping, handling, taxes, taxes and other fees, plus a 30-minute museum tour.

The first Singer cars were produced in 1905 by George Singer, who had worked for Coventry Machinists before producing cycle, tricycles and then cars. The Chamois was a luxury version of the Hillman Imp, with a plusher interior, better soundproofing and sporty instrumentation, plus jazzier exterior bright work. For 1966, the excellent Singer Chamois Sport arrived using the same peppy Imp Sport spec, while there was even a coupe based upon the Sunbeam Stiletto. For 1969, the Chamois featured quadruple headlamps but range was killed off just a year later. The Singer Gazelle (To 1967) was an upmarket newcomer powered by the same rev-happy engine as used in the less expensive Hillman.

Saussurea involucrata flowers and stems have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, cough with cold, stomachache, dysmenorrhea, and altitude sickness. The root of the snow Lotus is used in Tibetan medicine for curing dysentery and ulcer. The slow-growing wild plant is endangered by collections, and a substitute grown in tissue culture has been suggested. The plant has been found to have antiinflammatory, cardiotonic, abortifacient, anticancer, and antifatigue actions. It has been shown to inhibit the mRNA expression of iNOS by lipopolysaccharide stimulated macrophages, thus reducing nitric oxide production. Ethanol extracts were shown to have analgesic and antiinflammatory effects at high doses of 75-300 milligrams per kilogram. It was classified a rare herb as precious as lingzhi mushroom, and old ginseng in most Chinese martial arts literature. It is considered to be one of the most sacred plants in India, and has been used for offerings to goddess Nanda Devi for time immemorial. It can be found in China, Russia, North America, and northern Europe. It's a common saw-wort in the Arctic northeast Asia, Alaska, Canada, and northwest Asia. It also grows in the Himalayas and in the Tibetan Plateau, where it's considered a delicacy. The leaves can grow up to 2.5 feet tall, and the flowers can grow to 3.5 inches tall. They can be grown in China and Taiwan, as well as in North America and the Himalayan region of Canada and the U.S., where they're known as the ""Himalayan Saw-Wort"" It can also grow in the Alps and the Alps in northern Europe and northern Asia, and in northern and central Asia, such as Russia and North America. The seeds can be used to make tea, and it's also used as a tea substitute in Tibet and the Indian Himalayan Plateau. In China, it's used to treat stomachaches and stomachaches, and to treat ulcers and dysenteries. It may also be used in Chinese medicine to treat dysenters. It could be used as part of a treatment for ulcers in the Pin Valley of Himachal Pradesh, India, where its root is used to cure dysenteria and ulcers. The roots of the plant can also be taken as a remedy for ulcer and stomachache in Tibet.

The series premiered on 5 March 2015 and garnered 3.4 million viewers, giving BBC2 a rare ratings victory over both BBC1 and ITV. The Guardian newspaper has named the series ""I'm a Convict, Get me Out of Here!"" The Telegraph gave the TV series two stars out of five because of its ""grim"" nature. The TV series represents a historic period in Australia that is considered controversial. Some noted that there are no Indigenous Australian characters, omitting their perspective on the advent of the colony. In the poem, “If,”  Rudyard Kipling gives advice to his son on how to become a man; yet his advice rings true for everyone. Why does the poet say that triumph and disaster are two imposters in the poem ""If"" by Rudyard Kiplings? The answer is found in stanza 2 of the poem ‘If.’ The poem is labeled a didactic poem because its purpose is to teach. In each stanza, Kipling provides guidance in some aspect of life. The first stanza covers building self-confidence, never giving up, not judging other people too harshly, being patient, and loving not hating. The second stanza includes always dreaming, using his  intelligence, and ignoring fools. The two lines above the Wimbledon tunnel are found instanza 2. The words are easy to live with. Triumph  signifies  winning, victory, success, and achievement. Disaster brings a different set of circumstances: tragedy, adversity, loving, misfortune, and defeat. With this idea comes losing with grace, remembering that he did the best he could do--  then there is no loser. If a person does win a tennis match, the spelling bee, the beauty pageant--never boast  but show sportsmanship toward the fellow competitors,  doing the best a person can do is winning no matter what the outcome. Winning is great, but disaster is only temporary. Both situations are pretenders because they are not last but do not do not last. Thankfully, nobody wants to lose,  and it is the grace that shows in either situation that makes one win or lose in the situation that is ludicrous. The BBC2 drama was BBC2’s second biggest new drama launch for several years, behind Wolf Hall, which began in January with an overnight audience of 3.9 million.

Interrobang is a nonstandard punctuation mark used in various written languages. It combines the functions of the question mark and the exclamation mark or exclamation point. A sentence ending with an interrobang asks a question in an excited manner, expresses excitement or disbelief in the form of a question, or asks a rhetorical question. The word itself is an example of a portmanteau that incorporates an onomatopoeia. It is also used to express judgements of particular chess moves through their use as punctuation in chess annotation. ""!?"" denotes an ""interesting"" move, while ""?!"" denotes a ""dubious"" move. It can be hand-written with a single stroke plus the dot. One common application is in cartoons, as a stand-alone symbol of surprise. In 1966, Richard Isbell of American Type Founders issued the Americana typeface and included the Interrobang as one of the characters. In 1968, an inter Robang key was available on some Remington typewriters. During the 1970s, one could buy replacement inter Robangs keycaps and typefaces for some Smith-Corona typewriter. Although most dictionaries do not include the interRobang, it has disappeared: Lucida Grande, many legacy versions of Apple's OS X operating system, and several versions of Microsoft's Wingdings 2 ch dings ch ch 2 ch ch ch 3 ch ch 4 ch ch 5 ch 4 are all interRobangs. For more information on the InterRobang and other punctuation marks, see: http://www.pennsylvania.org/punctuation/interrobang/InterRobang-Punctuation-Mark.html#interRobang. The interrobangs are a superimposition of these two marks and are used in many languages to express surprise, excitement, disbelief, and the like. The name Inter Robang comes from the Latin interrogatio, which means ""a rhetorical question"" or ""cross-examination"";  bang is printers' slang for the ""bang"" mark. In informal English, the same inflection is usually notated by ending a sentence with first a question mark, and then an exclamation marks, or vice versa. Many people are unfamiliar with the inter robang, and would be puzzled when first seeing it, although its intention is usually self-evident. The interrobang is a punctuation mark that consist of the superimposition of an exclamation mark and other punctuation marks. It was accepted into Unicode and is present in several fonts, including Lucida Sans Unicode, Arial Unicode MS, and Calibri, the default font in the Office 2007, 2010 and 2013 suites. Few modern typefaces or fonts include a glyph for the Interrobang character. It is not a standard punctuation Mark. It can be used in some word processors with the alt code when working in a font that supports theinterrobang, or using an operating system that performs font substitution. The State Library of New South. Wales, New South Wales, Australia, uses an interrobangs as its logo,  as does educational publishing company Pearson, who intend it to. convey ""the excitement and fun of learning"". Chief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook used an interRobang in the 2012 Seventh Circuit opinion Robert F. Booth Trust v. Crowley. The standard interrobANG is at Unicode code point.  The inverted interrob Mang is at code point  and. Single-character versions of the double-glyph versions are also available at code points  and. The interrobng can be displayed in LaTeX by using the package textcomp and the command \textinterRobang.  It is found on the Character Palette, obtained by pressing the key combination. On Mac OS X, it is found in the character Palette on the right bracket and tilde keys on US keyboard layouts.

LONDON -  Scottish actor Gordon Jackson, known to television viewers around the world as the crotchety butler Hudson in the TV series ""Upstairs, Downstairs,"" died Sunday, his agent said yesterday. He was 66.
Mr. Jackson died Sunday at Cromwell Hospital in London, agent Michael Anderson said. No cause of death was given.
Mr. Jackson's long career in about 60 films made his face and gentle, rolling Scots accent familiar to two generations of moviegoers, but it was his lead role in ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" that brought the widest fame.
As Hudson, the tall, ginger-haired actor presided over the often chaotic ""downstairs"" servants' world with a stern hand but soft heart; his old-fashioned sense of duty and propriety was a bulwark to the aristocratic Bellamy family ""upstairs"" during the times of changing values of post-World War I. …

Death in the Afternoon (cocktail)
Death in the Afternoon, also called the Hemingway or the Hemingway Champagne,   is a cocktail made up of absinthe and Champagne invented by Ernest Hemingway. The cocktail shares a name with Hemingway's book Death in the Afternoon, and the recipe published in So Red the Nose, or Breath in the Afternoon, 1935 cocktail book with contributions from famous authors.   Hemingway's original instructions were:

""Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly.""

It is claimed that the cocktail was invented by Hemingway after he spent time in the Left Bank, Paris, and enjoyed the absinthe there.  The original printed recipe for the drink claimed that it was invented ""by the author and three officers of the H.M.S. Danae after having spent seven hours overboard trying to get Capt. Bra Saunders’ fishing boat off a bank where she had gone with us in a N.W. gale.""   Death in the Afternoon is known for both its decadence and its high strength.  

There are a number of alternative ways to produce Death in the Afternoon. The absinthe can be added to the glass after the Champagne, as some brands of absinthe will float on the Champagne for a short time. Other alternatives have arisen because of the difficulty of acquiring absinthe; the absinthe can be replaced with Absente, an alternative to absinthe available where it is illegal, or a strong pastis, such as Pernod. Variants which use an alternative to absinthe are sometimes given a different name, but are also sometimes still referred to as Death in the Afternoon.  Some recipes direct the person making the cocktail to use ingredients in addition to the Champagne and absinthe; Valerie Mellma recommends that a sugar cube and several dashes of bitters be added to the glass prior to the main ingredients. 

The cocktail is milky in appearance on account of the spontaneous emulsification of the absinthe (or substitute), and bubbly, which it takes from the Champagne. After the first sip, however, it becomes significantly less bubbly. Harold McGee, dining and wine writer for The New York Times, said that it ""seemed a waste of effervescence"" (though substituting Pernod for the absinthe).

Passage:
Béchamel sauce
Béchamel sauce ( or;  ), also known as white sauce, is made from a white roux (butter and flour) and milk. Even though it first appeared in Italian cooking books (constituting one of the simplest sauces of the Italian cuisine), it is now considered one of the mother sauces of French cuisine.  It is used as the base for other sauces (such as Mornay sauce, which is Béchamel with cheese). 

Origin

Béchamel was a financier who held the honorary post of chief steward to King Louis XIV. The sauce first appeared in some Italian cooking books of the Rennaissance, but was introduced under its familiar name in Le Cuisinier François, published in 1651 by  François Pierre La Varenne (1615–1678), chef de cuisine to Nicolas Chalon du Blé, marquis d'Uxelles. The foundation of French cuisine, the Cuisinier François ran through some thirty editions in seventy-five years.

The sauce originally was a veal velouté with a large amount of cream added. 

Saulnier's Répertoire presents one recipe as: ""White roux moistened with milk, salt, onion stuck with clove, cook for 20 minutes."" 

Preparation

Béchamel is traditionally made by melting a quantity of butter, and adding an equal part of flour to make a roux, which is cooked under gentle heat while stirring with a whisk. As it is a white sauce, care must be taken not to brown the roux. Then heated milk is gradually whisked in, and the sauce is cooked until thickened and smooth. The proportion of roux and milk determines the thickness of the sauce, typically one to three tablespoons each of flour and butter per cup of milk. 

One tablespoon each of butter and flour per cup of milk makes a thin, easily pourable sauce.  Two tablespoons of each makes a medium thick sauce. Three tablespoons of each makes an extra thick sauce, such as used to fill croquettes or as a soufflé base. Salt and white pepper are added and it is customary in Italy to add a pinch of nutmeg.  Optionally a whole or cut onion, studded with one or more whole cloves, and a bay leaf may be simmered with the milk and then strained before adding to the roux.

Uses

Sauces

Béchamel sauce is the base for a number of other classic sauces with additional ingredients added including:
*Mornay sauce (cheese)
*Nantua sauce (crayfish, butter and cream)
*Crème sauce (heavy cream)
*Mustard sauce (prepared mustard seed)
*Soubise sauce (finely diced onions that have been sweated in butter)
*Cheddar cheese sauce (Cheddar cheese, dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce)

The term ""white sauce"" or sauce blanche may also be applied to a simple sauce consisting only of milk and melted butter, without flour or spices. 

Dishes

Dishes made with béchamel sauce include:
*Cauliflower cheese
*Croque Monsieur (some variations)
*Croquette
*Fisherman's Pie
*Lasagne
*Parmo, a type of escalop originating in Middlesbrough, that is popular in North East England.
*Moussaka and pastitsio, layered dishes found in Greece and throughout the Balkans and Middle East
*Veal Orlov

Bibliophilia
Bibliophilia or bibliophilism is the love of books, and a bibliophile is an individual who loves books. 

Profile

The classic bibliophile is one who loves to read, admire and collect books, often amassing a large and specialized collection. Bibliophiles do not necessarily want to possess the books that they love; an alternative would be unusual bindings, autographed copies, etc.

Usage of the term

Bibliophilia is not to be confused with bibliomania, an obsessive–compulsive disorder involving the collecting of books to the extent that interpersonal relations or health may be negatively affected, and in which the mere fact that a physical object is a book is sufficient for it to be collected or beloved. Some use the term ""bibliomania"" interchangeably with ""bibliophily"", and in fact, the Library of Congress does not use the term ""bibliophily,"" but rather refers to its readers as either book collectors or bibliomaniacs. 
The New York Public Library follows the same practice. 

History

According to Arthur H. Minters, the ""private collecting of books was a fashion indulged in by many Romans, including Cicero and Atticus"".  The term bibliophile entered the English language in 1824.  A bibliophile is to be distinguished from the much older notion of a bookman (which dates back to 1583), who is one who loves books, and especially reading; more generally, a bookman is one who participates in writing, publishing, or selling books. 

Lord Spencer and the Marquess of Blandford were noted bibliophiles. ""The Roxburghe sale quickly became a foundational myth for the burgeoning secondhand book trade, and remains so to this day""; this sale is memorable due to the competition between ""Lord Spencer and the marquis of Blandford [which] drove [the price of a probable first edition of Boccaccio's Decameron] up to the astonishing and unprecedented sum of £2,260"".  J. P. Morgan was also a noted bibliophile. In 1884, he paid $24,750 for a 1459 edition of the Mainz Psalter.
Question:
A bibliophile is a lover of what?
Answer:

National Hunt flat race
National Hunt Flat races, informally known as Bumper races, are a type of Flat racing but run under National Hunt racing rules in Britain and Ireland. 

National Hunt Flat races were created on 15 July, 1891 when a conference between the stewards of the British and Irish National Hunt Committees decided to abolish the distinction between the hunter and handicap horses and created a new amalgamated rule:

In modern days the National Hunt Flat races are designed for horses who have not previously ran under any other form of racing except National Hunt flat or French AQPS races and in Great Britain are restricted to horses aged 7 years or less.   They are used by trainers to give horses experience on a racecourse before beginning a career in Jumps Racing. Because of the lack of fences and hurdles, the horses sometimes run faster; however the low quality of many of these races, and that horses are only taking part to gain experience, often results in a slow pace. Bumpers are typically put at the end of a race meeting and such races are notorious for being difficult to predict the winner. The vast majority of National Hunt meetings in Ireland include a bumper.  They are run much less frequently in Britain.

The term 'bumper' arose because in the past because only amateur riders were allowed to compete and had an ungainly bumping style in comparison to the professionals.  

Bumpers are most commonly run over distances of 13 - 20 furlongs.
Question:
A National Hunt flat race is generally known as what?
Answer:

Farmers' Almanac
Not to be confused with the Old Farmer's Almanac. See American almanacs for historical publications with similar titles. 

Farmers' Almanac is an annual North American periodical that has been in continuous publication since 1818. Published by Geiger of Lewiston, Maine, it is famous for its long-range weather predictions and astronomical data, along with a blend of humor, trivia, and advice on gardening, cooking, fishing, and human interest. Conservation, sustainable living, and simple living are core values of the publication and its editors, and these themes are heavily promoted in every edition.

In addition to the popular U.S. version, the Almanac Publishing Company also publishes the Canadian Farmers' Almanac and a promotional version that businesses can personalize and distribute to customers. The total annual distribution of all Farmers' Almanac editions is more than 4 million copies.

History

The Farmers' Almanac was founded in Morristown, New Jersey, in 1818 by editor David Young and publisher Jacob Mann; this was, coincidentally, two years following the ""year without a summer"" which was an ecological disaster for farmers in northeastern America.

Astronomer Samuel Hart Wright succeeded Young in 1851, and is in turn succeeded by his son, Berlin Hart Wright, in 1875.

Ray Geiger served as the Farmers' Almanac's longest-running editor, from 1934 until shortly before his death in 1994. 
From 1949, the Farmers' Almanac's  is published by Almanac Publishing Company and distributed by Geiger Bros. 
In 1955, Geiger moved production of the Farmers' Almanac from Newark, New Jersey, to its current headquarters in Lewiston, Maine.

Ray Geiger was succeeded by his son, Peter Geiger, in 1994. The farmersalmanac.com website was launched in 1997.
The  Almanac Publishing Company partnered with Buy the Farm LLC, based in Savannah, Georgia for the purposes of publishing in video, television and new media, establishing ""Farmer's Almanac TV"" by 2006.

Weather prediction

Predictions for each edition are made as far as two years in advance. The U.S. retail edition of the Farmers' Almanac weather predictions for seven U.S. climatic zones, defined by the publishers, in the continental United State. Predictions cover 16 months, from the previous September (when the almanac for the new year is released) through December of the publication year.

The Farmers' Almanac will only state publicly that their method is a ""top secret mathematical and astronomical formula, that relies on sunspot activity, tidal action, planetary position and many other factors."" The Almanac's forecaster is referred to by the pseudonym Caleb Weatherbee.  According to the publishers, the true identity of the forecaster is kept secret to prevent him or her from being ""badgered"". 

Publishers point to ""many longtime Almanac followers claim that our forecasts are 80% to 85% accurate"" on their website.  Professional meteorologists refute this pointing to historical results of below 50 percent accuracy rate. ""The ability to predict events that far in advance is zero,"" according to Penn State meteorologist Paul Knight     Past American Meteorological Society president Dr. J. Marshall Shepherd has criticized the use of that space weather and sunspots as a weather forecasting tool noting this is ""not common meteorological practice .""

Notable articles

Most editions of the Farmer's Almanac include a ""human crusade,"" advocating for a change in some accepted social practice or custom. Previous crusades have included: ""How Much Daylight Are We Really Saving,"" a recommendation for a revised Daylight Saving Time schedule (2007); ""Why is Good Service So Hard to Schedule,"" recommending that service providers offer more specific timeframes when scheduling home visits (2006); ""A Kinder, Gentler Nation,"" urging readers to exercise more common courtesy (2003); ""Saturday: The Trick to Making Halloween a Real Treat,"" advocating that the observance of Halloween be moved to the last Saturday in October (1999); ""A Cure for Doctors' Office Delays,"" demanding more prompt medical service and calling for a ""Patients' Bill of Rights"" (1996); and ""Pennies Make No Sense,"" which sought to eliminate the penny, and to permanently replace the dollar bill with less costly-to-produce dollar coins (1989). 

Other pieces that have attracted attention over the years include:

* Farmers' Almanacs 2010 list of the ""5 Worst Weather Cities""  which elicited a call for retraction from syracuse.com  after naming the Central New York city as the worst winter weather city.
* The 2014 Winter Outlook   which called for a winter storm to hit just about the time Super Bowl XLVIII is to be played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. 
* The 2001 campaign to name an official National Dessert (readers resoundingly responded in favor of traditional apple pie).

Farmers' Almanac TV

In 2003, the Farmers' Almanac partnered with Buy the Farm LLC a Savannah, Georgia-based production company, to create Farmers' Almanac TV. The show – which featured segments in over a dozen lifestyle categories, including home and garden, sustainable living, cooking, natural cures, and weather – debuted on public television in the spring of 2006, bringing to life stories of grassroots living in both rural and urban America.

Farmers Almanac TV filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2009, in Chatham County, Georgia.

Popular culture

The Farmers' Almanac has also been referenced in numerous television shows and movies, including: The Office, MASH, Twin Peaks, The Dukes of Hazzard, Wings, Cold Case, The Last Starfighter, and Father of the Bride.  Popular culture does not always distinguish between the Farmers' Almanac and the older Old Farmer's Almanac, so it is not always clear to which publication a particular reference to meant to allude.

The Farmer's Almanac was used in Young Mr. Lincoln, a movie about the future president starring Henry Fonda.  Lincoln referenced the Almanac as a young lawyer in a court case that helped to acquit his client.

Country singer Randy Travis has a song titled, ""The Family Bible and The Farmer's Almanac"" on his CD ""A Man Ain't Made of Stone."" The song is about his farmer grandfather and what a wise man he was, yet the only two books he owned were the ones told in the title. He got all the life advice he needed from those two books.

Passage:
Scoville scale
The Scoville scale is a measurement of the pungency (spicy heat) of chili peppers, such as the jalapeño, the bhut jolokia, and the world's current hottest pepper—the Carolina Reaper, or other spicy foods as reported in Scoville heat units (SHU),  a function of capsaicin concentration. Capsaicin is one of many related chemicals, collectively called capsaicinoids.
The scale is named after its creator, American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville. His method, devised in 1912, is known as the Scoville Organoleptic Test.

Unlike methods based on high-performance liquid chromatography, the Scoville scale is an empirical measurement dependent on the capsaicin sensitivity of testers and so is not a precise or accurate method to measure capsaicinoid concentration.

Scoville organoleptic test 

In Scoville's method, an exact weight of dried pepper is dissolved in alcohol to extract the heat components (capsinoids), then diluted in a solution of sugar water.  Decreasing concentrations of the extracted capsinoids are given to a panel of five trained tasters, until a majority (at least three) can no longer detect the heat in a dilution. The heat level is based on this dilution, rated in multiples of 100 SHU.

A weakness of the Scoville Organoleptic Test is its imprecision due to human subjectivity, depending on the taster's palate and their number of mouth heat receptors, which varies greatly among people. Another weakness is sensory fatigue: the palate is quickly desensitised to capsaicins after tasting a few samples within a short time period. Results vary widely (up to ± 50%) between laboratories. 

Scoville ratings

Considerations

Since Scoville ratings are defined per unit of dry mass, comparison of ratings between products having different water content can be misleading.
For example, typical fresh chili peppers have a water content around 90 percent, whereas Tabasco sauce has a water content of 95 percent.  For law-enforcement-grade pepper spray, values from 500,000 up to 1 million SHU have been mentioned,  but the actual strength of the spray depends on the dilution, which could vary by a factor of 10. 

The chilis with the highest rating on the Scoville scale exceed one million Scoville units, and include specimens of naga jolokia or bhut jolokia and its cultivar, the ""ghost chili"", which does not have official cultivar status.  The Carolina Reaper is currently the highest rated pepper in the world. 

Numerical results for any specimen vary depending on its cultivation conditions and the uncertainty of the laboratory methods used to assess the capsaicinoid content. Pungency values for any pepper are variable, owing to expected variation within a species—easily by a factor of 10 or more—depending on seed lineage, climate (humidity is a big factor for the Bhut Jolokia; the Dorset Naga and the original Naga have quite different ratings), and even soil (this is especially true of habaneros). The inaccuracies described in the measurement methods above also contribute to the imprecision of these values.

Peppers

Pure chemicals

ASTA pungency units

Since at least the 1980s, spice heat has been more precisely measured by a method that uses high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This identifies and measures the concentration of heat-producing chemicals. The measurements are used in a mathematical formula that weights them according to their relative capacity to produce a sensation of heat. This method yields results, not in Scoville units, but in American Spice Trade Association (ASTA) pungency units. A measurement of one part capsaicin per million corresponds to about 16 Scoville units, and the published method says that ASTA pungency units can be multiplied by 16 and reported as Scoville units. Scoville units are a measure for capsaicin content per unit of dry mass.    This conversion is approximate, and spice experts Donna R. Tainter and Anthony T. Grenis say that there is consensus that it gives results about 20–50% lower than the actual Scoville method would have given.

Pharmaceutical use 

Neuropathy symptoms are often treated with high concentrations of topical hot pepper extracts (capsaicin) that is applied to the skin. This treatment can last as long as twelve weeks. Initially, the treatment is uncomfortable and a local anesthesia can be used to relieve the pain.

""There can be only one"" is the belief and motto among the immortals in the original Highlander film, its sequels and spin-offs. It implies that all immortals must fight and kill one another until only one remains standing; this ""one"" shall receive The Prize .
Highlander (1986)
Edit
Connor MacLeod first heard these words from The Kurgan in the battle between Clan MacLeod and Clan Fraser when The Kurgan impaled him and was about to cut his head off. Connor was saved by his clansmen, who rushed up and stopped The Kurgan.
Ramirez learnt of Connor MacLeod's ""miraculous"" survival, and tracked him down. He taught MacLeod everything about the immortals and the Quickening . He revealed that when only a few of them were left, they would irresistibly be pulled to The Gathering in a faraway land and fight for The Prize. He summed up by saying, ""In the end, there can be only one."" MacLeod was also told that an immortal was safe only on holy ground , and that immortals could not have children.
In his search for the Highlander, The Kurgan met Ramirez in MacLeod's home instead. He overpowered Ramirez after a hard battle, and also repeated the phrase before beheading Ramirez.
In 1985 New York City, Brenda Wyatt was suspicious of MacLeod and she was following him when The Kurgan appeared and attacked MacLeod on the street. The Kurgan taunted him with those words once again during the fight. They broke off and escaped when a police helicopter arrived. Brenda asked MacLeod what the phrase meant, but he bade her never to follow him again.
MacLeod faced off The Kurgan one last time. After beheading his opponent, he finally exclaimed, ""There can be only one.""

David Nixon (magician)
David Nixon (29 December 1919GRO Register of Births: MAR 1920 3a 1125 EDMONTON - David P. Nixon – 1 December 1978GRO Register of Deaths: DEC 1978 17 1052 SURREY SE - David Porter Nixon, DoB = 29 Dec 1919) was an English magician and television personality.  At the height of his career, Nixon was the best-known magician in the UK.

Early life

Born in Muswell Hill, London, Nixon attended the Westcliff High School for Boys in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex. His father was a lawyer whose hobby was magic and who took Nixon to watch performers such as Nevil Maskelyne and David Devant. One magician who made an early impression on the young boy was Stanley Collins, who had a gentlemanly image which influenced Nixon's later performing style. Nixon started performing magic himself after an aunt bought him an Ernest Sewell Magic Box for Christmas. On leaving school he gained a job with the Henley Telegraph, the in-house magazine of the W. T. Henley Telegraph company, a publication which had been founded by Alfred Hitchcock.  In 1938 he joined the Magic Circle. He also became an accomplished double bass player and performed with a local band.

Entertainment career

With the advent of the Second World War, Nixon joined ENSA, the organisation that was set up to provide entertainment for British troops. He had been prevented from serving in a front line role as a result of suffering from pneumonia when he was a teenager. In summer 1946, after leaving ENSA, he joined the Fol de Rols, a variety troupe based in Scarborough. He was joined on stage by the actor and comedian Norman Wisdom, who wreaked havoc with his act. The partnership was a roaring success and the two subsequently appeared at the London Casino.

In addition to his magic act, Nixon sang, danced and worked front of house. In 1947 he married a singer named Margaret Burton. The same year he got his first opportunity on television in a show called Café Continental. Nixon's big break came in 1954 when he was invited to be a panelist on the British version of the highly successful television quiz show What's My Line. He presented various series including the British version of Candid Camera, Comedy Bandbox (1962) (later David Nixon's Comedy Bandbox (1966) and was Basil Brush's first partner.  His magic shows included Tonight with David Nixon (1969), David Nixon's Magic Box (1970) and The David Nixon Show (1972). He also appeared as a panelist on TV and radio game shows, most notably on the UK TV version of What's My Line. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1973 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Magic Circle Headquarters in London. He then famously presented an episode of the programme the following year, in which the subject was none other than the series' regular British host, Eamonn Andrews. A keen chess player, Nixon also presented Checkmate, a Thames Television series teaching the basics of the game.

Alongside his skills as a stage magician, Nixon liked to use television technology for humour and entertainment. In the '70s, when the technology of chroma key became available, he developed a way to interact with a recording of himself apparently on the other side of a mirror. Not only was the conversation perfectly coordinated, he also used sleight-of-hand to appear to pass objects back and forth to himself. These segments became high points of his shows of that period.

David Nixon has been recognised as an influence on future UK magicians as diverse as Wayne Dobson  and Jerry Sadowitz. 

With a rich and mellow speaking voice, Nixon was also in demand as a compere and narrator. Alongside this he was a popular choice for pantomimes, which he enjoyed performing in and a favourite part was playing 'Buttons' in Cinderella. One of his most memorable performances was as a narrator in the show Emil and the Detectives, at the Mermaid Theatre, London.

Half Man Half Biscuit refer to Nixon in their song ""Reflections in A Flat"", from the album Back in the DHSS.

Mellotron

Among Nixon's lesser known activities was his involvement in backing the development and manufacture of the Mellotron and the company Mellotronics.  He even appeared in a Pathé news reel feature to demonstrate the instrument. 

Death

Nixon died of lung cancer in Surrey in 1978. He was a heavy smoker and was first found to have cancer in 1976. He underwent treatment, which appeared to have been successful, but the disease returned a couple of years later and he died just short of his 59th birthday.

Family

Nixon divorced Margaret in 1952. Later the same year Nixon married his second wife, Paula Marshall, who had worked with him in his act. Paula died aged 28 in a car crash in 1956, the year after the birth of the couple's son Nicholas. Nixon remarried in 1961 to Vivienne Robinson, the daughter of the well known bandleader Eric Robinson. They had a daughter, Mandy, in 1961.

For industry, it is a prime information source on such subjects as exploration and exploitation of natural resources and on the environmental implications of such activities in the polar regions; on the design of ice-strengthened shipping and selection of sea routes; and on problems of construction and transportation in cold environments. The library also offers an unrivalled resource for the needs of international relations and strategic defence.

The Picture Library contains a photograph collection from both the Arctic and Antarctic, mainly depicting the history of exploration in the polar regions, including much material from the expeditions of Scott and Shackleton. Its Thomas H. Manning Polar Archives are named in honour of the British-Canadian Arctic researcher, a university alumnus.  Its work includes an oral history programme which interviews people who have worked in the polar regions over the years. Due to high demand, the Polar Archives runs a booking scheme for anyone wishing to consult material.  The library is also home to the ICSU's World Data Centre for Glaciology, Cambridge (WDCGC), funded by the Royal Society. 

The most recent addition to the library is the Shackleton Memorial Library, which in 1999 won a regional award from the Royal Institute of British Architects.  This part of the building holds much of the library's Antarctic collection, as well as some of its subject-based material. 

The library is part of the Inspire Libraries scheme  and is open to anyone with a polar interest to use for reference work and research.

The Polar Museum

SPRI operates the Polar Museum, which features artefacts (particularly from the heroic age of exploration), paintings, drawings, photographs (which includes cinematographic film, lantern slides, and daguerreotypes), and other material relating to polar history, exploration, science and art.

In 2010 the renovated Polar Museum opened its doors to the public. It now displays more of its collections than before. The new displays are based on the theme of exploration into science, emphasising both the history of exploration of the Arctic and Antarctic and the wider environmental significance of the poles in a changing world.

Art and artefacts from the people who call the Arctic home are displayed alongside the last letters of Captain Scott and iconic Antarctic photographs by Herbert Ponting. A series of exhibits shows how science is undertaken in the harsh conditions of the polar regions.

As well as these permanent exhibits, the Museum regularly hosts special exhibitions and shows of modern polar art. The Museum is open Tuesdays to Saturdays, admission is free. 

Outside the institute stands a monument of British oak to those who lost their lives in Antarctica in pursuit of science. It was unveiled on 12 May 2011 by the sculptor, Oliver Barratt and Roderick Rhys Jones (Chairman of the British Antarctic Monument Trust).  The monument represents the mould from which a stainless steel needle has been cast; the needle was erected at Stanley on the Falkland Islands.

The Museum is one of the eight museums which make up the University of Cambridge Museums consortium. 

Research

SPRI has several research groups.

Glaciology and Climate Change Group

This group's work involves quantifying the state of the cryosphere using remote sensing by satellites, plus accurate field measurements and computer simulations, to understand the processes in detail. In particular, the group has been able to observe the melting of the Larsen Ice Shelf, the rapid retreat of ice in western Antarctica, and increased summer melting in northern Canada. This work has contributed greatly to understanding climate change.

Glacimarine Environments Group

This group's work focuses on the dynamics of ice-sheets and delivery of sediment to the marine environment. The group uses geophysical and geological evidence gathered by icebreakers in the polar seas.

Polar Landscape and Remote Sensing Group

This group's work focuses on the processes which modify the polar and sub-polar environments, such as Arctic vegetation, and snow and ice cover. Improving techniques for measuring vegetation from satellite data is an important part of the work.

Polar Social Science and Humanities Group

This is an interdisciplinary group covering the anthropology, history and art of the Arctic. Its work includes looking at politics and environmental management in the polar regions, with particular expertise in the religion, culture and politics of the Russian North.

Passage:
Guatemalan quetzal
The quetzal (; code: GTQ) is the currency of Guatemala, named after the national bird of Guatemala, the resplendent quetzal.

In ancient Mayan culture, the quetzal bird's tail feathers were used as currency. It is divided into 100 centavos or lenes in Guatemalan slang. The plural is quetzales.

Exchange rate 

History

The quetzal was introduced in 1925 during the term of President José María Orellana, whose image appears on the obverseof the one-quetzal bill. It replaced the peso. Until 1987, the quetzal was pegged to and domestically equal to the United States dollar and before the pegging to the US dollar, it was pegged to the French franc as well, since the quetzal utilized the gold standard.

Coins

In 1925, coins in denominations of 1, 5, 10 centavos, ¼, ½ and 1 quetzal were introduced, although the majority of the 1 quetzal coins were withdrawn from circulation and melted. ½ and 2 centavos coins were added in 1932. Until 1965, coins of 5 centavos and above were minted in 72% silver. ½ and 1 quetzal coins were reintroduced in 1998 and 1999, respectively. Coins currently in circulation are:
*1 centavo
*5 centavos
*10 centavos
*25 centavos
*50 centavos
*1 quetzal

Banknotes

The first banknotes were issued by the Central Bank of Guatemala in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 100 quetzales, with ½ quetzal notes added in 1933. In 1946, the Bank of Guatemala took over the issuance of paper money, with its first issues being overprints on notes of the Central Bank.  Except for the introduction of 50 quetzales notes in 1967, the denominations of banknotes were unchanged until ½ and 1 quetzal coins replaced notes at the end of the 1990s.

In the top-right corner of the obverse face of each banknote, the value is displayed in Mayan numerals, representing Guatemala's cultural history.

The Bank of Guatemala has introduced a polymer banknote of 1 quetzal on August 20, 2007. The Bank of Guatemala has also introduced a 5 quetzal polymer banknote on November 14, 2011.

Three Blind Mice
""Three Blind Mice"" is an English-language nursery rhyme and musical round.I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), p. 306. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 3753.

Lyrics

The modern words are:

Three blind mice. Three blind mice.
See how they run. See how they run.
They all ran after the farmer's wife,
Who cut off their tails with a carving knife,
Did you ever see such a sight in your life,
As three blind mice?W. S. Baring-Gould and C. Baring-Gould, The Annotated Mother Goose: Nursery Rhymes Old and New (Bramhall House, 1962), p. 156.

""Complete version""

Published by Frederick Warne & Co., an illustrated children's book by John W. Ivimey entitled The Complete Version of Ye Three Blind Mice,  fleshes the mice out into mischievous characters who seek adventure, eventually being taken in by a farmer whose wife chases them from the house and into a bramble bush, which blinds them. Soon after, their tails are removed by ""the butcher's wife"" when the complete version incorporates the original verse. The story ends with them using a tonic to grow new tails and recover their eyesight, learning a trade (making wood chips, according to the accompanying illustration), buying a house and living happily ever after. Published perhaps in 1900,  the book is now in the public domain. 

Origins and meaning

A version of this rhyme, together with music, was published in Deuteromelia or The Seconde part of Musicks melodie (1609). The editor of the book, and possible author of the rhyme,  was Thomas Ravenscroft, who in 1609 was still a teenager. The original lyrics are:

Three Blinde Mice,
Three Blinde Mice,
Dame Iulian,
Dame Iulian,
the Miller and his merry olde Wife,
she scrapte her tripe licke thou the knife.

Attempts to read historical significance into the words have led to the speculation that this musical round was written earlier and refers to Queen Mary I of England blinding and executing three Protestant bishops,  but problematically the Oxford Martyrs, Ridley, Latimer and Cranmer, were burned at the stake, not blinded; although if the rhyme was made by crypto-Catholics, the mice's ""blindness"" could refer to their Protestantism.

The rhyme only entered children's literature in 1842 when it was published in a collection by James Orchard Halliwell.

Variations

Amateur music composer Thomas Oliphant (1799–1873)  noted in 1843 that:
This absurd old round is frequently brought to mind in the present day, from the circumstance of there being an instrumental Quartet by Weiss, through which runs a musical phrase accidentally the same as the notes applied to the word Three Blind Mice. They form a third descending, C, B, A. 

Robert Schumann's Kreisleriana #7, which is arguably about a cat (Murr), appears to be based upon ""Three Blind Mice"", but in a predominantly minor key. ""Three Blind Mice"" is to be found in the fugue which is the centerpiece of #7.

Joseph Holbrooke (1878–1958) composed his Symphonic Variations, opus 37, based on Three Blind Mice. Also, Joseph Haydn used its theme in the Finale (4th Mvt) of his Symphony 83 (La Poule) (1785–86); one of the 6 Paris Symphonies, and the music also appears in the final movement of English composer Eric Coates' suite The Three Men. ""Three Blind Mice"" was also used as a theme song for The Three Stooges and a Curtis Fuller arrangement of the rhyme is featured on the Art Blakey live album of the same name. The song is also the basis for Leroy Anderson's orchestral ""Fiddle Faddle"".

The theme of the second movement of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 4 (1926, revised 1928 and 1941) was criticized as resembling Three Blind Mice.

Colorado rock band Sawatch recorded a version of Three Blind Mice on their new cd ""Another Gin.'

Use in popular culture

The soundtrack for the 1962 James Bond film Dr. No features  ""Kingston Calypso"", a calypso version of ""Three Blind Mice"" with new lyrics, in reference to three villainous characters in the film. 

In several sports (basketball and hockey, for example, which have three referees), ""Three Blind Mice"" is used as a derogatory phrase for poor referees. Bands also play the song to mock referees in similar cases. Such references, however, are frowned upon officially by both sports as unsportsmanlike. [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2709823 ESPN – Frank not fined; Kidd docked $20K for postgame rant - NBA], Sports.ESPN.Go.com.  Before Major League Baseball required four umpires at every game, there were regularly three. The Brooklyn Dodgers had a fan band called the ""Sym-Phoney Band"", led by Shorty Laurice, which started playing ""Three Blind Mice"" when the umpires came out onto the field until the league office ordered the team to stop, around the same time a fourth umpire was added. In 1985, Wilbur Snapp, the organist for the Clearwater Phillies, was thrown out of the game for playing ""Three Blind Mice"" after what he considered a bad call. In 1992, Jason Patrick, keyboardist for the Amarillo Texans independent baseball team, was also ejected for playing the song after a disputed call.  On August 1, 2012, during a Daytona Cubs – Fort Myers Miracle minor-league baseball game, umpire Mario Seneca tossed the public address announcer Derek Dye for playing the song ""Three Blind Mice"" after a disputed call at first base. 

Canadian rock trio Rush often played ""Three Blind Mice"" as an intro to their own songs in concert, notably during their ""Hold Your Fire"" tour of 1987–1988.  An elaborate parody of the rhyme, arranged as if it were a piece of jazz-music, occurs in an act by Ronnie Corbett and Ronnie Barker, poking fun at Johnny Dankworth and Cleo Laine.

Century Dictionary
The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia was one of the largest encyclopedic dictionaries of the English language.  The first edition was published from 1889 to 1891 by The Century Company of New York, in six, eight, or ten volume versions (originally issued in 24 fascicles) in 7,046 pages with some 10,000 wood-engraved illustrations.  It was edited by Sanskrit scholar and linguist William Dwight Whitney, with Benjamin Eli Smith's assistance.  It was a great expansion of the smaller Imperial Dictionary of the English Language, which in turn had been based on the 1841 edition of Noah Webster's American Dictionary.

After Whitney's death in 1894, supplementary volumes were published under Smith's supervision, including The Century Cyclopedia of Names (1894) and The Century Atlas (1897).  A two-volume Supplement of new vocabulary, published in 1909, completed the dictionary.  A reformatted edition, The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia, was published in 1911 in twelve quarto volumes: ten of vocabulary, plus the volume of names and the atlas.  This set went through several printings, the last in 1914.  The same year, the ten vocabulary volumes were published as one giant volume, about 8500 pages in a very thin paper. The now much coveted India paper edition also appeared around this time, usually in 5 double volumes (rarely, in 10 single volumes) plus one additional for the Cyclopedia.

The completed dictionary contained over 500,000 entries, more than Webster's New International or Funk and Wagnalls New Standard, the largest other dictionaries of the period.  Each form of a word was treated separately, and liberal numbers of quotations and additional information were included to support the definitions.  In its etymologies, Greek words were not transliterated.

Although no revised edition of the dictionary was ever again published, an abridged edition with new words and other features, The New Century Dictionary (edited by H.G. Emery and K.G. Brewster; revision editor, Catherine B. Avery,) was published by Appleton-Century-Crofts of New York in 1927, and reprinted in various forms for over thirty-five years.  The New Century became the basis for the American College Dictionary, the first Random House Dictionary, in 1947.  The three volume New Century Cyclopedia of Names, an expansion of the 1894 volume, was published in 1954, edited by Clarence Barnhart.

The Century Dictionary was admired for the quality of its entries, the craftsmanship in its design, typography, and binding, and its excellent illustrations.  It has been used as an information source for the makers of many later dictionaries, including editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, who cited it over 2,000 times in the first edition. In 1913, Stewart Archer Steger from the University of Virginia published his Ph.D. dissertation ""American Dictionaries"" and devoted a 14-page Chapter VI to Century Dictionary. He concluded the chapter with these words: ""Altogether, The Century Dictionary far surpasses anything in American lexicography"".

Passage:
The Son of Man
The Son of Man () is a 1964 painting by the Belgian surrealist painter René Magritte.

Magritte painted it as a self-portrait. The painting consists of a man in an overcoat and a bowler hat standing in front of a low wall, beyond which is the sea and a cloudy sky. The man's face is largely obscured by a hovering green apple. However, the man's eyes can be seen peeking over the edge of the apple. Another subtle feature is that the man's left arm appears to bend backwards at the elbow.

About the painting, Magritte said:

Similar paintings

The Son of Man resembles The Great War on Façades (La Grande Guerre Façades), another Magritte painting featuring similar imagery. Both feature a person standing in front of a wall overlooking the sea. The Great War on Façades, however, features a woman holding an umbrella, her face covered by a flower. There is also Man in the Bowler Hat, a similar painting where the man's face is obscured by a bird rather than an apple.

In popular culture 

In Gary Braunbeck's novel Keepers, the antagonist figures (the ""Keepers"" of the title) resemble the nattily-dressed, bowler-hatted figures of Magritte's painting. Also, in the opening scene of the book, the reference is directly made and explained to this resemblance because of an apple-scented car air freshener printed with the image of the painting hanging in the protagonist's car.

In Lev Grossman's 2009 novel The Magicians the antagonist is a man wearing a suit, with his face obscured by a leafed branch suspended in midair.

In Jimmy Liao's illustrated book The Starry Starry Night, the protagonist girl, with the painting illustrated behind her, imitates the painting to express her protest against her parents' long term fighting. 

In 1970, Norman Rockwell did a playful homage to The Son of Man as a 13 by oil painting entitled Mr. Apple  in which a man's head is replaced, rather than hidden, by a red apple.

The music video to ""Astral Traveller"" by the band Yes features a similarly dressed man walking away from the camera throughout the video.  He turns to the camera at the end of the video to reveal a large picture of a green apple floating in front of his face.

The painting appears in Alejandro Jodorowsky's film The Holy Mountain, on a wall in the house of Jupiter. 

A parody of the painting, with Bart behind the floating apple, can be seen briefly at the start of The Simpsons episode ""Treehouse of Horror IV"". 

The set design, costumes, and promotional poster for the 1992 movie Toys reflect the painting's style.

The painting appears briefly on the video for Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson's song ""Scream"" (1995), on the “Gallery” section. 

The painting appears several times in the 1999 version of The Thomas Crown Affair, especially in the final robbery scenes when men wearing bowler hats and trench coats carry briefcases throughout the museum to cover Crown's movements and confuse the security team. 

It is referenced in the 2006 film Stranger Than Fiction.

In the film Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium (2007), the painting is seen hanging on the wall half finished; at the end of the film Mr Magorium is seen to be painting the rest of it.

This painting also shows up at the end of the film Bronson (2008). British prisoner Charlie Bronson takes a hostage and turns him into this particular portrait.

The cover of the book Rubies in the Orchard: How to Uncover the Hidden Gems in Your Business (2009) has a version of the painting, with a pomegranate.

In the movie 500 Days of Summer (2009), the bowler hat and green apple can be seen in Summer's apartment.

During his performance in the 2012 semi-final of UK talent show The Voice, judge (and the Script frontman) Danny O'Donoghue reenacted the scene depicted in the painting, donning the distinctive hat and clothing, with a model of the apple suspended in front of his face.

A parody painting can be found in Underground Cabins in Terraria.

Passage:
Rock Lobster
""Rock Lobster"" is a song written by Fred Schneider and Ricky Wilson, two members of The B-52's. It was produced in two versions, one by DB Records released in April 1978, and a longer version, which was part of the band's 1979 self-titled debut album, released by Warner Bros.   The song became one of their signature tunes and it helped launch the band's success.

""Rock Lobster"" was the band's first single to appear on the Billboard Hot 100, where it reached No. 56. A major hit in Canada, the single went all the way to No. 1 in the RPM national singles chart. Its follow-up was ""Private Idaho,"" in October 1980, which reached No. 74 in the US. It was well received by critics and was placed at No. 147 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. 

Composition and themes

The DB Records single version lasts 4'37"" and is rawer and faster than the 1979 Warner single version.  It has, however, almost the same lyrics of the second version, just including some extra lines in the listing of marine animals. The 1979 single version itself is an edit from the album version released in 1979, which lasts about seven minutes and contains an extra verse.

Its lyrics include nonsensical lines about a beach party and excited rants about real or imagined marine animals (""There goes a dog-fish, chased by a cat-fish, in flew a sea robin, watch out for that piranha, there goes a narwhal, here comes a bikini whale!""), accompanied by absurd, fictional noises attributed to them (provided by Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson — Pierson providing the higher-pitched noises and Wilson the lower-pitched ones); the chorus consists of the words ""Rock Lobster!"" repeated over and over on top of a keyboard line.

""Rock Lobster"" is written in the key of C minor (with a raised fourth in the chorus) and is in common time. Instruments used in the music include a baritone-tuned surf-style Mosrite electric guitar, a Farfisa Combo Compact organ, and drums. Kate Pierson played the song's bass line on a Korg SB-100 ""Synth Bass"" synthesizer.

Reception

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the song ""incredibly infectious"" and ""memorable"". 

Personnel

*Fred Schneider – vocals, cowbell
*Kate Pierson – vocals, Farfisa organ, synth bass
*Cindy Wilson – vocals, tambourine
*Ricky Wilson – electric guitar
*Keith Strickland – drums, percussion

Chart performance

The song was well-received overall, and was the band's first single to appear on the Billboard Hot 100, where it reached No. 56. In Canada, released on the Warner Bros. label, the single became a huge hit, eventually going on to reach No. 1 in the RPM-compiled national chart on May 24, 1980. Although Rock Lobster only reached No. 37 on the UK Singles Chart in August 1979, it fared better there when reissued in 1986, reaching No. 12 as a double A-side with Planet Claire. 

Weekly charts

Year-end charts

In popular culture

In spring 1980, John Lennon, whose post-Beatles music career had been on hiatus for nearly 5 years while he helped raise his son Sean, was prompted to record again after hearing ""Rock Lobster"";  according to Lennon, ""it sounds just like Ono's music, so I said to , 'It's time to get out the old axe and wake the wife up!'""   His return to the studio led to the release of Double Fantasy. At a 2002 B-52's concert in New York, Yoko Ono joined them onstage for the performance of this song. 

The song appears in the Family Guy episodes ""The Cleveland–Loretta Quagmire"" (where Peter plays it on guitar)  and ""Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q"" (as ""Iraq Lobster""), and in the 2008 movie The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie (as ""Rock Monster"").  

Early Commodore Amiga 500 units had ""B52/ROCK LOBSTER"" etched on the main circuit board. 

The song is playable in the video game Just Dance 4. 

Panic! at the Disco sampled the song's guitar riff for their song ""Don't Threaten Me with a Good Time"" on their fifth studio album Death of a Bachelor (2016).

It is claimed that the cocktail was invented by Hemingway after he spent time in the Left Bank, Paris. The cocktail is milky in appearance on account of the spontaneous emulsification of theAbsinthe. After the first sip, however, it becomes significantly less bubbly. Some recipes direct the person making the cocktail to use ingredients in addition to the Champagne and absinthes. Variants which use an alternative toAbsente or Pernod are sometimes given a different name, but are also sometimes still referred to as Death In The Afternoon. Béchamel sauce ( or;  ), also known as white sauce, is made from a white roux (butter and flour) and milk. The sauce first appeared in some Italian cooking books of the Rennaissance, but was introduced under its familiar name in Le Cuisinier François, published in 1651 by François Pierre La Varenne (1615–1678), chef de cuisine to Nicolas Chalon du Blé, marquis d'Uxelles. The foundation of French cuisine, the Cuiseier François ran through some thirty editions in seventy-five years. The original recipe for the drink claimed that it was invented ""by the author and three officers of the H.M.S. Danae after having spent seven hours overboard trying to get Capt. Bra Saunders’ fishing boat off a bank where she had gone with us in a N.W.G.Gale"" The original printed recipe claims that the author invented the cocktail after spending time in Paris, and enjoyed the Absinthe there. The recipe was published in So Red the Nose, or Breath in the afternoon, a 1935 cocktail book with contributions from famous authors. The drink is known for both its decadence and its high strength. It can be made with any of the following ingredients: Champagne, Absente, or a strong pastis, such as Pernadod. It has also been known to be served with a glass of red wine, or with a bottle of white wine, as well as with a selection of champagne and other spirits such as Cognac, Prosecco, Cognac and Trois Marchesi, and with a small amount of grappa, or even with a cup of red vermouth. Bibliophilia or bibliophilism is the love of books, and a bibliophile is an individual who loves books. Bibliophiles do not necessarily want to possess the books that they love; an alternative would be unusual bindings, autographed copies, etc. The term ""white sauce"" or sauce blanche may also be applied to a simple sauce consisting only of milk and melted butter, without flour or spices. National Hunt Flat races were created on July 15, 1891 when the stewards of the British and Irish Committees decided to abolish the disti races. The National Hunt flat race, informally known as National Hunt Bumper races, is a type of Flat racing run under National Hunt racing rules in Britain and Ireland. The word ""bibliophile"" was used in the English language for the first time in 1824, when it was used to describe a person who loves to read, admire and collect books. It is not to be confused with bibliomania, an obsessive–compulsive disorder involving the collecting of books to the extent that interpersonal relations or health may be negatively affected, and in which the mere fact that a physical object is a book is sufficient for it to be collected or beloved. In 1884, J. P. Morgan paid $24,750 for a 1459 edition of the Mainz Mainz edition of Boccaccio's Decameron. The sale was memorable due to the competition between ""Lord Spencer and the marquis of Blandford [which] drove [the price of a probable first edition of Decameron] to the astonishing sum of £2,260"". In 1883, a bookman is one who participates in writing, publishing, or selling books. The New York Public Library follows the same practice and refers to its readers as either book collectors and bibliomaniacs. The Library of Congress does not use the term 'bibliophily,' but rather refers to it as 'book collectors' and 'book lovers' It is customary in Italy to add a pinch of nutmeg to sauces such as Nantua and Soubise sauce, and it is also customary to add salt and white pepper to sauces like Mornay and Croque Monsieur. In the U.S. one to three tablespoons each of flour and butter per cup of milk makes a thin, easily pourable sauce. Two tablespoons of each makes a medium thick sauce, such as used to fill croquettes or as a soufflé base, and three tablespoons make an extra thick sauce. ction between the hunter and handicap horses and created a new amalgamated rule. The term 'bumper' arose because in the past because only amateur riders were allowed to compete and had an ungainly bumping style in comparison to the professionals. Bumpers are typically put at the end of a race meeting and such races are notorious for being difficult to predict the winner. The vast majority of National Hunt meetings in Ireland include a bumper. They are run much less frequently in Britain. The Farmers' Almanac was founded in Morristown, New Jersey, in 1818 by editor David Young and publisher Jacob Mann. It is famous for its long-range weather predictions and astronomical data, along with a blend of humor, trivia, and advice on gardening, cooking, fishing, and human interest. Conservation, sustainable living, and simple living are core values of the publication and its editors, and these themes are heavily promoted in every edition.Predictions for each edition are made as far as two years in advance. The U.S. retail edition of the Farmers’ Almanac weather predictions for seven U.s. climatic zones, defined by the publishers, in the continental United State. Predictions cover 16 months, from the previous September (when the almanac for the new year is released) through December of the published year. The total annual distribution of all Farmers'Almanac editions is more than 4 million copies. The farmersalmanac.com website was launched in 1997. The Almanac Publishing Company partnered with Buy the Farm LLC, based in Savannah, Georgia, for the purposes of publishing in video, television and new media, establishing ""Farmer's Almanac TV"" by 2006. The almanac is published by Almanac publishing Company and distributed by Geiger Bros.  in Lewiston, Maine. It has been in continuous publication since 1818 and is published in English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian. It also publishes a promotional version for businesses that businesses can personalize and distribute to customers. It was founded by David Young, who was succeeded by Samuel Hart Wright in 1851, and is in turn succeeded by his son, Berlin Hart Wright,. in 1875. Most editions of the Farmer's Almanac include a ""human crusade,"" advocating for a change in some accepted social practice or custom. Publishers point to ""many longtime Almanac followers claim that our forecasts are 80% to 85% accurate"" Professional meteorologists refute this pointing to historical results of below 50 percent accuracy rate. The 2014 Winter Outlook called for a winter storm to hit just about the time Super Bowl XLVIII is to be played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. The Office, MASH, Twin Peaks, The Dukes of Hazzard, Wings, Cold Case, The Last Starfighter, and Father of the Bride are all references to the Farmers' Almanac. The Almanac was used in Young Mr. Lincoln, a movie about the future president starring Henry Fonda. Country singer Randy Travis has a song titled, ""The Family Bible and The Farmer’s Almanac"" on his CD ""A Man Ain't Made of Stone"" The song is about his farmer grandfather and what a wise man he was, yet the only two books he owned were the ones told in the title. He got all the life advice he needed from those two books. It is not always clear to which publication a particular reference to meant to allude, so it is not often clear which publication the Almanac is referring to. The Farmers’ Almanac TV debuted on public television in the spring of 2006, bringing to life stories of grassroots living in both rural and urban America. The show – which featured segments in over a dozen lifestyle categories, including home and garden, sustainable living, cooking, natural cures, and weather – filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2009, in Chatham County, Georgia. It has been referenced in numerous television shows and movies, including: The Office,. MASH,. Twin Peaks,. The Duke of Hazard, and Wings,Cold Case, and The Last starfighter. It was also used in a court case that helped to acquit a young lawyer in a lawsuit against the federal government. It also was referenced in the book The Family Bible, which was written by the late, great, great-great-grandfather of the American farmer. Some of the best-known, most long-lived, and most established backing bands (with lead artist) include: Ace in the Hole (George Strait) The E Street Band (Bruce Springsteen) The Eagles (Linda Ronstadt) The Flecktones (Bela Fleck) The Four Seasons (Frankie Valli) The Funky Bunch (Marky Mark) The New Power Generation (Prince) The News (Huey Lewis) The Pips (Gladys Knight) The Revolution ( Prince) The Rumour (Graham Parker) The Waves (Katrina Leskanich) The Shondells (Tommy James) The Spiders from Mars (David Bowie) The Stooges (Iggy Pop) The Sunshine Band (KC) The Supremes (Diana Ross) The Tennessee Three (Johnny Cash) The Vandellas (Martha Reeves) The Wailers (Bob Marley)The Scoville scale is a measurement of the pungency (spicy heat) of chili peppers, such as the jalapeño, the bhut jolokia, and the world's current hottest pepper—the Carolina Reaper. Capsaicin is one of many related chemicals, collectively called capsaicinoids. The scale is named after its creator, American pharmacist Wilbur Scovilles. His method, devised in 1912, is known as the Scville Organoleptic Test. It is not a precise or accurate method to measure capsaic inoid concentration. The Scovile scale is an empirical measurement dependent on the capsaicIn sensitivity of testers. Another weakness is the sensory fatigue: the palate is quickly desensitised to capsaicins after a short time. The heat level based on this dilution, rated in multiples of 100 SHU, is its imprecision due to human subjectivity, depending on subjectivity and subjectivity of the taster's palate and number of mouth receptors, which varies greatly among people, which can no longer detect the heat in a short period of time within a few samples within a short test period. It can also be difficult to measure due to the human Subjective Subjectivity due to Subjectivity, Subjectivity and Subjectivity depending on the subject subject. It's also difficult to extract the exact weight of dried pepper in a solution of sugar water, then extract the heat components then diluted in a diluted solution of salt and sugar water. For more information, see: http://www.scoville.org/scville-scale.html. ""There can be only one"" is the belief and motto among the immortals in the original Highlander film, its sequels and spin-offs. The Carolina Reaper is currently the highest rated pepper in the world. Pungency values for any pepper are variable, owing to expected variation within a species—easily by a factor of 10 or more. A measurement of one part capsaicin per million corresponds to about 16 Scoville units, and the published method says that ASTA pungency units can be multiplied by 16. This conversion is approximate, and experts say that there is consensus that it gives results about 20–50% lower than the actual Scovilles method would have given. The original Highlander was released in 1986 and has been adapted into a TV series and a film, Highlander: The Final Frontier, which airs on PBS stations in the UK and the U.S. on September 11, 2013. For more information on the Highlander, visit the official Highlander website or watch the TV series on PBS.com.

David Nixon (29 December 1919 - 1 December 1978) was an English magician and television personality. At the height of his career, Nixon was the best-known magician in the UK. His magic shows included Tonight with David Nixon (1969), David Nixon's Magic Box (1970) and The David Nixon Show (1972) He also appeared as a panelist on TV and radio game shows, most notably on the UK TV version of What's My Line. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1973 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Magic Circle Headquarters in London. In the series of the same year, Nixon famously presented an episode of the programme the following year, in which the subject was none other than the series' regular British host, Eamann Andrews. Nixon was a keen chess player, and also presented Checkmate, a Thames Television series teaching the basics of the game. Nixon liked to use technology for humour and entertainment, when the key of chroma key beca key was used to play the game of Checkmate in the '70s and '80s. He died in 1978 at the age of 69, and was buried in Kensal Rise, London. He is survived by his wife, Margaret Burton, and two children, Michael Nixon and David Porter Nixon, and a step-son, David Nixon, Jr. The phrase ""There can be only one"" is also part of the lyrics in Queen song "" A Kind of Magic "" which is the closing theme music during Highlander's closing credits. In Highlander: The Search for Vengeance (2007) the character Marcus Octavius said ""There Can be Only One"" when he tried to behead Colin MacLeod. He didn't care about The Game. Marcus apparently always said this when he killed another immortal. He also became an accomplished double bass player and performed with a local band. In summer 1946, after leaving ENSA, he joined the Fol de Rols, a variety troupe based in Scarborough. The same year he got his first opportunity on television in a show called Café Continental. The partnership was a roaring success and the two subsequently appeared at the London Casino. In 1947 he married a singer named Margaret Burton. David Nixon was an influence on future UK magicians such as Wayne Dobson and Jerry Sadowitz. He developed a way to interact with a recording of himself apparently on the other side of a mirror. Nixon was a popular choice for pantomimes, which he enjoyed performing in and a favourite part was playing 'Buttons' in Cinderella. He was a heavy smoker and was first found to have cancer in 1976. He underwent treatment, which appeared to have been successful, but the disease returned a couple of years later and he died just short of his 59th birthday. Nixon died of lung cancer in Surrey in 1978. He is buried at St Paul's Cathedral, London, with his wife, Paula Marshall, and their two children, Nicholas and Vivienne Robinson. He also had a daughter, Mandy, who he had with his second wife, Vivienne, who died aged 28 in a car crash in 1956. He had a son, Nicholas, with Paula Marshall who died in 1956, the year after the birth of the couple's son Nicholas. Nixon had two daughters with his first wife, Margaret, and a daughter with Vivienne. His son Nicholas was also a magician and appeared in the film The Spider's Web (1960) Nixon was also involved in backing the development and manufacture of the Mellotron and the company Mellotronics. He even appeared in a Pathé news reel feature to demonstrate the instrument. He died in 1978 at the age of 59, and is buried with his family at St Peter's Cathedral in London, where he had lived since the early 1950s. His daughter Mandy was born in 1961. Nixon also had two children with PaulaMarshall, who had worked with him in his act. Nixon is buried in St Peter’s Cemetery in London with his son Nicholas, who appeared in The Spider”s Web ( 1960) and his daughter Vivienne who was also born in the early 1960s. The Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) is a centre for research into the polar regions and glaciology worldwide. It investigates issues relevant to the Arctic and Antarctic in the environmental sciences, social sciences and humanities. lar regions, including much material from the expeditions of Scott and Shackleton. Its Thomas H. Manning Polar Archives are named in honour of the British-Canadian Arctic researcher, a university alumnus. The library is also home to the ICSU's World Data Centre for Glaciology, Cambridge (WDCGC), funded by the Royal Society. The most recent addition to the library is the Shackleton Memorial Library, which in 1999 won a regional award from the Royal Institute of British Architects. This part of the building holds much of the library's Antarctic collection, as well as some of its subject-based material. The Polar Museum features artefacts (particularly from the heroic age of exploration), paintings, drawings, photographs, and other material relating to polar history, exploration, science and art. A series of exhibits shows how science is undertaken in the harsh conditions of the polar regions. The Museum is open Tuesdays to Saturdays, admission is free. Outside the institute stands a monument of British oak to those who lost their lives in Antarctica in pursuit of science. It was unveiled on 12 May 2011 by the sculptor, Oliver Barratt and Roderick Rhys Jones (Chairman of British Antarctic Monument Trust) The monument represents the mould from which a stainless steel needle has been cast; the needle was erected at Stanley on the Falkland Islands. The museum is one of the eight museums which make up the University of Cambridge Museums consortium.SPRI has several research groups, including the Polar Landscape and Remote Sensing Group. Its work focuses on processes which modify the polar and sub-polar environments, such as Arctic vegetation, and snow and ice cover. In particular, the group has been able to observe the melting of the Larsen Ice Shelf, the rapid retreat of ice in western Antarctica, and increased summer melting in northern Canada. This work has contributed greatly to understanding climate change. It is open to anyone with a polar interest to use for reference work and research. For more information, visit SPRI's website. The quetzal (; code: GTQ) is the currency of Guatemala. It was introduced in 1925 during the term of President José María Orellana. Until 1987, it was pegged to and domestically equal to the United States dollar. It is divided into 100 centavos or lenes in Guatemalan slang. In ancient Mayan culture, the bird's tail feathers were used as currency. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 3753. The Bank of Guatemala has introduced a polymer banknote of 1 quetzals on August 20, 2007. The banknotes were issued in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 100 quetzales. Until 1965, coins of 5 centavo and above were minted in 72% silver. The value is displayed in Mayan numerals, representing Guatemala's cultural history. In 1946, the Bank of Guatemalan took over the issuance of paper money, with its first issues being overprints on notes of the Central Bank. Except for the introduction of 50 quetzale notes in 1967, the denominations of bank notes were unchanged until ½ and 1Quetzal coins replaced notes at the end of the 1990s. The original lyrics of the nursery rhyme Three Blind Mice are: ""They all ran after the farmer's wife, who cut off their tails with a carving knife,Did you ever see such a sight in your life, as three blind mice?"" The rhyme was written by Thomas Ravenscroft, who was still a teenager in 1900, and published in The Second Musickse part of The Musicke melodie (09 of 16). The editor of the book, Deuteromelia or Deuteros, is now in the public domain and could be a possible author of the rhyme, as is the book's author, John W. Ivimey, who wrote the lyrics for The Complete Version of Ye Three blind Mice (1951). The original rhyme is available online at: http://www.themusickse.org.uk/Three-Blind-Mice-Rhyme-The-Second-Musickse-Part-Dame-The.html. For more information on The Second-Musicke-Melodie, see http:// www.musicks.org/The. Musickses/The-Complete-The Second-Theming-The Third-The rhyme (1952-1953). For more on The. Musickes, click here. ""Three Blind Mice"" was written in 1842 by amateur music composer Thomas Oliphant. The song was used as a theme song for The Three Stooges and a Curtis Fuller arrangement of the rhyme is featured on the Art Blakey live album of the same name. In 1985, Wilbur Snapp, the organist for the Clearwater Phillies, was thrown out of the game after what he considered a bad call. In 1992, Jason Patrick, keyboard for the Amarillo Texans independent baseball team, was also ejected for playing the song after a disputed call. The phrase is also used in several sports (basketball and hockey, for example, which have three referees), where it is seen as a derogatory phrase for poor referees. In 2012, during a Daytona Cubs – Fort Myers Miracle minor-league baseball game, umpire Mario Seneca tossed the public announcer Derek Deca for playing ""Three blind mice"" in the middle of an intro to their ""Hold Your Fire"" concert. In the 1962 James Bond film Dr. No, a calypso version of the song was included in the soundtrack, with new lyrics, in reference to three villainous characters in the film. In 1988, Ronnie Corbett, poking fun at Johnny Laine Cleo, said: “Those poor “Three blind Mice’s” are poor and poor.’’ “I’m sorry,” he said, “but they’re blind.” “They’ve been blind for a long time,’ he added. “And I’d rather be blind than have them blind”.‘“I don’t think it’ll happen to you, but if it does, you�’, he said. ‘’. ’‘It’ might be a good idea to have a little fun with it, but I don”t want you to think that it means ‘blindness’ or ‘blindness of the eye’ and ‘Blindness in the face’ is not the same thing as blindness of the mind’ – “Blind” is the word for “blind” in English. ””“Three Blind” means “three” or “one”, and “blind’ in English is “the same” as “mice” – “Mice“. Carla Lane died at a nursing home aged 87, at the end of last month. Her sitcoms, including Butterflies, Bread and The Liver Birds, established Lane as one of the best-loved writers. Today, her funeral service took place at 2pm at Liverpool Cathedral. She leaves two sons, Nigel and Colin, and a daughter, Toni. The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia was published from 1889 to 1891 by The Century Company of New York. It was a great expansion of the smaller Imperial Dictionary of the English Language, which in turn had been based on the 1841 edition of Noah Webster's American Dictionary. The completed dictionary contained over 500,000 entries, more than Webster's New International or Funk and Wagnalls New Standard, the largest other dictionaries of the period. It has been used as an information source for the makers of many later dictionaries, including editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, who cited it over 2,000 times in the first edition. In 1913, Stewart Archer Steger from the University of Virginia published his Ph.D. dissertation ""American Dictionaries"" and devoted a 14-page Chapter VI to Century Dictionary. He concluded the chapter with these words: ""Altogether, The Century dictionary far surpasses anything in American lexicography"".Digitization works are out of copyright, and efforts have been made to digitize the volumes.

The painting consists of a man in an overcoat and a bowler hat standing in front of a low wall, beyond which is the sea and a cloudy sky. The man's face is largely obscured by a hovering green apple, but the man's eyes can be seen peeking over the edge of the apple. The set design, costumes, and promotional poster for the 1992 movie Toys reflect the painting's style. In Lev Grossman's 2009 novel The Magicians the antagonist is a man wearing a suit, with his face obscured with a leafed branch suspended in midair. In Jimmy Liao's illustrated book The Starry Starry Night, the protagonist girl, with the painting illustrated behind her, imitates the painting to express her protest against her parents' long term fighting. In the film Mr Magorium (2007), the painting is seen hanging on the wall half finished at the end of the film. A parody of the painting, with Bart behind the floating apple, is seen briefly at the start of The Simpsons episode ""Treehouse of Horror IV"" The painting appears several times in the 1999 version of The Thomas Crown Affair, especially in the final robbery scenes when men wearing bowler hats and trench coats carry briefcases throughout the museum to cover Crown's movements and confuse the security team. In Gary Braunbeck's novel Keepers, the antagonist figures (the ""Keepers"" of the title) resemble the nattily-dressed, bowler-hatted figures of Magritter's painting. The music video to ""Astral Traveller"" by the band Yes features a similarly dressed man walking away from the camera throughout the video to reveal a large picture of a green apple floating in front to his face. There is also an apple-scented car air freshener printed with the image of the Painting hanging in the protagonist's car. The Holy Mountain, on a wall in the house of Jupiter, is a reference to the painting in Alejandro Jodorowsky's film The Holy Mountains. The Son of man is referenced in the 2006 film Stranger Than Fiction. It is also seen in the cover of the book How to Uncover the Hidden Gems in Your Business (2009) by Charlie Bronson, with a version of the portrait of the Rubies. ""Rock Lobster"" is a song written by Fred Schneider and Ricky Wilson, two members of The B-52's. It was produced in two versions, one by DB Records released in April 1978, and a longer version, which was part of the band's 1979 self-titled debut album, released by Warner Bros. The song was well received by critics and was placed at No. 147 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In Canada, the single became a huge hit, eventually going on to reach No. 1 in the RPM-compiled national chart on May 24, 1980. In spring 1980, John Lennon, whose post-Beatles music had been on hiatus while he helped raise son Sean, was prompted to record ""Rock Lobsters"" after hearing it. At a 2002 B- 52's concert in New York, Yoko Ono joined them onstage for the performance of the song. In the movie 500 Days of Summer (2009), the bowler hat and green apple can be seen in Summer's apartment. During his performance in the 2012 semi-final of UK talent show The Voice, judge (and the Script frontman) Danny O'Donoghue reenacted the scene depicted in the painting, donning the distinctive hat and clothing, with a model of the apple suspended in front of his face. In common time, the song is written in the key of C minor (with a raised fourth in the chorus) and is in common time. Instruments used in the music include a baritone-tuned surf-style Mosrite electric guitar, a Farfisa Compact organ, and drums. The lyrics include nonsensical lines about a beach party and excited rants about real or imagined marine animals, accompanied by absurd, fictional noises attributed to them (provided by Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson) The chorus consists of the words ""Rock lobster!"" repeated over and over on top of a keyboard line. In 1986, when reissued in 1986, it reached No. 12 as a double A-side with Planet Claire, reaching No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100, and No. 37 on the UK Singles Chart in August 1979. It has been played on the Korg SB-100 ""Synth Bass"" synthesizer on the soundtrack to the film The Grand Budapest Hotel, starring Tom Hanks and Liam Neeson, and on the TV series ""The Voice"" The song appears iPlayer for the first time at the end of this article. The song is played in the Family Guy episodes ""The Cleveland–Loretta Quagmire"" and ""Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q"" (as ""Iraq Lobster"") Panic! at the Disco sampled the song's guitar riff for their song ""Don't Threaten Me with a Good Time"" on their fifth studio album Death of a Bachelor (2016) Early Commodore Amiga 500 units had ""B52/ROCK LOBSTER"" etched on the main circuit board."

‘The unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable’ – Oscar Wilde
After a merry chase through English parliamentary procedure, hunting with dogs was finally banned by Act of Parliament on 18 November. Prime Minister Blair tried a final decoy to delay the ban until after the general election (he will need their votes), but with no luck. The horn has been sounded Tally-ho! The hunters are pledged to disrupt the nation, the general election and all things foreign (ie urban) until they get their way and are able to pursue small animals across the countryside and tear them to pieces for pleasure once more (more endearing are their badges enscribed ‘Bollocks to Blair’).
But contrary to Countryside Alliance and pro-hunting claims, according to a Mori Poll published in The Guardian on 18 December 2001, 83% of people in the UK think hunting is cruel, unnecessary or unacceptable. In a Gallup poll for the Daily Telegraph in 1997, 77% of rural dwellers disapproved of fox hunting.
The Act will outlaw the cruel and barbaric killing of animals for pleasure. Other blood ‘sports’ which involve cruelty to animals, such as hare coursing, badger baiting, cock fighting and dog fighting, were outlawed long ago. The pro-hunters claim that their pastime is not cruel and helps to rid the countryside of predatory pests which kill farm animals like lambs and chickens. In fact foxes feed mainly on rabbits and rats – a benefit to farmers. There are estimated to be 250,000 adult foxes in the UK, producing about 400,000 cubs a year, most of which will die in their first year of life. Humans kill about 400,000 foxes a year so a ban on fox hunting, which kills about 20,000 a year at most, will have little impact on the numbers.
Far worse than their disgusting pleasures, however, are the claims of the pro-hunting, landed elite that they are the guardians and custodians of the English landscape, who know best how to protect English heritage. The landowners have successfully harnessed a general feeling of grievance in rural areas as a result of a crisis in farming in order to defend their wealth, power and privilege. They shamelessly portray themselves as defenders of working people’s jobs, homes and futures.
The United Kingdom consists of 60 million acres. 41 million of these are designated ‘agricultural land’. 15 million acres are considered ‘waste’ and consist of forests, rivers, mountains and are predominantly owned by the Forestry Commission and the Ministry of Defence. That leaves four million acres for ‘urban plot’. Of this total 60 million acres, 69% is owned by 0.6% of the population. That means that 158,000 families own 41 million acres and 24 million families live on four million acres. According to current figures, land is more fairly distributed in Brazil than in the Britain.
English landowners have consistently damaged the English countryside in favour of profits and subsidies. They have persistently destroyed wildlife habitats like woodland and hedgerows. Their gamekeepers trap and poison birds of prey to protect their pheasants (for profitable shoots), and their sheep are dipped in noxious chemicals which poison farmworkers, rivers and fish. Conservators and guardians they are not!
Estimates vary as to the number of people who are employed directly in hunting. The Campaign for Rural Rights, launched by the Countryside Alliance in 1997, claims that 160,000 full and part-time jobs will be lost as a result of the ban. Research by the Produce Studies Group showed that the ban would threaten at least 16,000 jobs in hunting and associated trades and activities – 70% of them in rural areas. Independent research by Dr Neil Ward of the University of Newcastle found that fewer than 1,000 full-time jobs are directly linked to hunting.
If the hunting lobby were seriously concerned about the future of workers in the countryside (and they never have been before), then there are many other possible leisure activities which would involve many more people in work and participation than the rather select band who go hunting. And therein lies the rub! They don’t actually want to attract hoi polloi, the ordinary people, in any numbers to enjoy rural pursuits. They expect our sympathy for their civil liberty to chase freely over the countryside in pursuit of foxes, but don’t any of us dare to go for a walk across their land!

Passage:
Hippomenes
The name Hippomenes may also refer to the father of Leimone.

In Greek mythology, Hippomenes (), also known as Melanion (Μελανίων or  Μειλανίων),  was a son of the Arcadian Amphidamas  or of Megareus of Onchestus  and the husband of Atalanta. He was known to have been one of the disciples of Cheiron, and to have surpassed other disciples in his eagerness to undertake hard challenges.  Inscriptions mention him as one of the Calydonian hunters. 

Overview 

The main myth of Hippomenes' courtship of Atalanta, narrated by Pseudo-Apollodorus, Ovid,  Servius,  and Hyginus  was as follows.

Hippomenes fell in love with Atalanta, the virgin huntress who strongly disliked the idea of getting married. Disturbed by  men admiring her beauty as she ran through the forest, she declared that whoever wanted to marry her was to beat her in a footrace (herself being a notoriously swift runner), and that those who should try and lose would be punished by instant death.
Another version (followed by Hyginus) was that her father wanted her to be married, but she did not. She agreed to running races against her suitors because she thought she would never lose.

Atalanta raced all her suitors and outran all but Hippomenes, who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win a fair race with Atalanta, so he prayed to Aphrodite for help (the goddess, in the meantime, disliked Atalanta's neglect of love). 

Aphrodite gave him three golden apples – which came from her sacred apple-tree in Tamasus, Cyprus, according to Ovid,  or from the garden of the Hesperides according to Servius – and told him to drop them one at a time to distract Atalanta. After each of the first two apples, Atalanta was able to recover the lead, but when she stopped for the third, Hippomenes won the race. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.

Atalanta and Hippomenes were turned into lions by Cybele as punishment after having sex in one of her temples they entered to take a rest during their journey to Hippomenes' home (the Greeks believed that lions could not mate with other lions, but only with leopards). Ovid and Servius suggest that Hippomenes forgot to pay the tribute to Aphrodite he had promised for helping him, and consequently, during the two's stay at Cybele's temple, Aphrodite caused them to have sex after going mad with lust, knowing that this would offend Cybele, and this indeed resulted in Cybele (or Zeus according to Hyginus) transforming them into lions. Thereafter they drew Cybele's chariot, which Servius equates with the Earth itself.

According to some accounts, Hippomenes (Melanion) was the father of Parthenopaeus;   yet others stated Atalanta had her son by either Ares or Meleager prior to her marriage to Hippomenes.

In mythology who famously competed against Melanion?

See No Evil, Hear No Evil
See No Evil, Hear No Evil is a 1989 American comedy film directed by Arthur Hiller and produced by Marvin Worth for TriStar Pictures. It stars Richard Pryor as a blind man and Gene Wilder as a deaf man who work together to thwart a trio of murderous thieves. This is the third film reuniting Wilder and Pryor who had appeared previously in Silver Streak (1976) and Stir Crazy (1980).

Plot summary

A blind man named Wally Karew (Richard Pryor) and a deaf man named Dave Lyons (Gene Wilder) meet when Wally applies for a job in Dave's New York City concession shop. 
After a brief period of confusion and antagonism, Wally and Dave become close friends. Dave reads lips and guides Wally when they travel, and Wally tells Dave about invisible sounds and what people say behind his back. At a local bar, Wally defeats an aggressive bully in a fistfight with assistance from Dave, who uses clock-face directions to tell Wally where his opponent is. Dave hires Wally.

One morning, as Wally waits outside for the day's newspapers, a man walks into Dave's shop. When the man is approached by a beautiful woman named Eve (Joan Severance), he quickly removes a gold coin from a suitcase and places it in a box of coins sitting on the counter.  The woman takes the suitcase and shoots the man in the stomach as Dave - whose back is turned - reads the information on a box of antacid pills.  Dave neither sees nor hears the shooting, but he notices Eve's legs as she leaves the shop.  Wally, who heard the gunshot, walks into the shop and trips over the man's dead body.  Dave then rushes to help Wally and picks up the gun, which Eve left at the scene.  When the police arrive, they find Dave and Wally standing over the body with Dave holding the gun. Before they are arrested, Dave tells Wally to collect the coins from the box.

At the police station, Dave and Wally are interrogated by Captain Braddock (Alan North), a talented but merciless detective who immediately hates them and makes them his prime suspects. When Eve and her accomplice Kirgo (Kevin Spacey) - hoping to recover the coin - arrive to bail them out by posing as attorneys, Wally recognizes Eve's perfume and Dave recognizes her legs, but Braddock ignores them when they insist that she is the killer. Wishing to avoid Eve and Kirgo when they are released, Dave and Wally escape from the police station, but the criminals soon find them. Eve takes the coin from Wally's pocket and telephones her boss Mr. Sutherland (Anthony Zerbe) for instructions, allowing Dave to learn the criminals' plans by reading her lips.  When Kirgo tries to kill Dave and Wally, they use the fistfighting method they learned in the bar to knock him unconscious. They then steal an unattended police car, and drive away with Eve, Kirgo and Braddock chasing them. Working together to guide the patrol car, Dave and Wally evade both the police and the criminals, but they accidentally launch the car onto a waterborne garbage barge.

After hiding the police car, the two men walk to a motel and telephone Wally's sister Adele (Childs) for help. The police follow Adele and search her motel room, but she, Wally, and Dave avoid detection, and they drive away after the police have left. Having incorrectly read Eve's lips, Dave believes they need to find a woman named ""Grace George"", but Adele realizes that Eve must have been referring to a resort called ""Great Gorge"". At the resort, Wally impersonates a visiting professor while Dave steals the coin from Eve. Meanwhile, Adele distracts Kirgo by crashing her car into his. However, Kirgo and Eve kidnap Adele and take her to Sutherland's estate.

After a tragic mishap with the car, Dave and Wally put their rescue plan into action, with the result that Adele escapes but the two men are captured. In his study, Sutherland reveals that the coin is a room-temperature superconductor, which is extremely valuable. Kirgo and Sutherland are killed during an argument over sharing the profits from the coin's theft, after which Dave and Wally escape the study and have a violent altercation with Eve and her helicopter pilot. When the police arrive, the remaining criminals are arrested, and Wally and Dave are released having been cleared of the charges. Shortly thereafter, the two men go to a local park and reprise a scene from the beginning of the film by dumping ice-cream cones on each other's head; enjoying each other's company.

Reception

TriStar Pictures was looking to produce another film starring Wilder and Pryor, and Wilder agreed to do See No Evil, Hear No Evil only if he was allowed to re-write the script. The studio agreed and See No Evil, Hear No Evil premiered on May 1989 to mostly negative reviews. Many critics praised Wilder's and Pryor's, and Kevin Spacey's performances, but they mostly agreed that the script was terrible. Roger Ebert called it ""a real dud"",  the Deseret Morning News described the film as ""stupid"", with an ""idiotic script"" that had a ""contrived story"" and too many ""juvenile gags.""  On the other hand Vincent Canby called it ""by far the most successful co-starring vehicle for Mr. Pryor and Mr. Wilder"", while also acknowledging that ""this is not elegant movie making, and not all of the gags are equally clever.""  

The film holds 18% of positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite the negative reviews, the film was a box office success for its time, able to stay at number one for two weeks.
Question:
Who plays the deaf man in the 1989 film ‘See No Evil, Hear No Evil’?

Passage:
Long Walk to Freedom
Long Walk to Freedom is an autobiographical work written by South African President Nelson Mandela, and published in 1995 by Little Brown & Co. The book profiles his early life, coming of age, education and 27 years in prison. Under the apartheid government, Mandela was regarded as a terrorist and jailed on the infamous Robben Island for his role as a leader of the then-outlawed ANC. He has since achieved international recognition for his leadership as president in rebuilding the country's once segregated society.  The last chapters of the book describe his political ascension, and his belief that the struggle continues against apartheid in South Africa.

Mandela dedicated his book to ""my six children, Madiba and Makaziwe (my first daughter) who are now deceased, and to Makgatho, Makaziwe, Zenani and Zindzi, whose support and love I treasure; to my twenty-one grandchildren and three great-grandchildren who give me great pleasure; and to all my comrades, friends and fellow South Africans whom I serve and whose courage, determination and patriotism remain my source of inspiration.""

Overview

In the first part of the autobiography, Mandela describes his upbringing as a child and adolescent in South Africa, and being connected to the royal Thembu dynasty. His childhood name was Rolihlahla, which is loosely translated as ""pulling the branch of a tree"", or a euphemism for ""troublemaker"".

Mandela describes his education at a Thembu college called Clarkebury, and later at the strict Healdtown school, where students were rigorously put in routines. He mentions his education at the University of Fort Hare, and his practice of law later on. He also then writes; ""Democracy meant all men to be heard, and decision was taken together as a people. Majority rule was a foreign notion. A minority was not to be clashed by a majority."" (p. 29)

In the second part of the book, Mandela introduces political and social aspects of apartheid in South Africa, and the influences of politicians such as Daniel François Malan who implemented the nadir of African freedoms, as he officially commenced the apartheid policies. Mandela joined the African National Congress in 1950 and describes his organisation of guerrilla tactics and underground organisations to battle against apartheid.

In 1961, Mandela was convicted for inciting people to strike and leaving the country without a passport and sentenced to five years imprisonment. However, Mandela was shortly thereafter sentenced to life imprisonment for sabotage in what was known as the ""Rivonia Trial"", by Justice Dr. Quartus de Wet, instead of a possible death sentence. (p. 159)

Mandela describes prison time on Robben Island and Pollsmoor Prison. His 28-year tenure in prison was marked by the cruelty of Afrikaner guards, backbreaking labour, and sleeping in minuscule cells which were nearly uninhabitable. Unlike his biographer Anthony Sampson, Mandela does not accuse the warder James Gregory of fabricating a friendship with his prisoner. Gregory's book Goodbye Bafana discussed Mandela's family life and described Gregory as a close personal friend of Mandela. According to Mandela: The Authorised Biography, Gregory's position was to censor the letters delivered to the future president, and he thereby discovered the details of Mandela's personal life, which he then made money from by means of his book Goodbye Bafana. Mandela considered suing Gregory for this breach of trust.  In Long Walk to Freedom Mandela remarks of Gregory only that 
'I had not known him terribly well, but he knew us, because he had been responsible for reviewing our incoming and outgoing mail.' 

Later on in his sentence, Mandela met South African president, Frederik Willem de Klerk, and was released from prison in 1990. Unlike his friend Anthony Sampson's account, Mandela's book does not discuss the alleged complicity of de Klerk in the violence of the eighties and nineties, or the role of his ex-wife Winnie Mandela in that bloodshed. Mandela became the South African president in 1994.

Reviews

The book won the Alan Paton Award in 1995, and has been published in numerous languages, including an Afrikaans translation by Antjie Krog.

Film adaptation

Long Walk to Freedom has been adapted into a film titled Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom directed by Justin Chadwick, written by William Nicholson, and produced by Anant Singh. Mandela personally awarded the film rights to the book to Singh's company some years before 2009. Singh believes that as the film is based on Mandela's own writing, it will be the ""definitive"" biopic of him.  English actor Idris Elba portrays Mandela in the film.  The film was limited released on 29 November 2013 in the United States. Full release happened on Christmas Day 2013 in the United States. 
When the film was shown in London for Prince William and his wife, Nelson Mandela's death was announced.

Ghost writer

In an obituary of Mandela, The Times reported that the later chapters had been ""ghosted by a skilful US journalist"", and that Mandela had later started work on a second set of memoirs without a ghost writer.
Question:
""Whose autobiography was entitled """"A Long Walk to Freedom""""?""

Passage:
East Lyn River
The East Lyn is a river which rises high in Exmoor, in the English county of Somerset. It flows through the East Lyn Valley in Devon.

History

The Lynmouth Disaster occurred on the East Lyn river  due to rocks and fallen trees having been washed into the West Lyn river. These formed a log jam near Watersmeet, forming a landslide dam. When the pressure behind the dam increased to uncontrollable levels, the water broke out of the dam, and rushed down the East Lyn (via the convergence of the rivers) into Lynmouth, obliterating houses and ultimately resulting in 34 deaths. Boulders from the incident can still be seen today, lining the banks of the East Lyn as it travels into Lynmouth today.

Watercourse

The river is formed as the Upper East Lyn at Malmsmead from two minor tributaries, the Oare Water and Badgworthy Water. It flows for several miles, past Brendon and makes confluence with Hoar Oak Water at Watersmeet, where Watersmeet House is situated.  The river then passes through a narrow gorge section, before flowing downstream for a further  until the river meets with the West Lyn River and flows into the Bristol Channel at Lynmouth. 

Recreation

Angling

Angling interests especially in the summer are targeted towards the salmon which migrate up the river to spawn. There is also trout fishing. 

Walking

It is popular for walkers with the Two Moors Way near to much of the river.

Whitewater kayaking

Whitewater kayakers frequently run this river in the winter when seeking a challenging Grade 4 paddle.
Question:
The River Lyn is in which English county?
Answer:
Devon, England

By the Sleepy Lagoon
""By the Sleepy Lagoon"" is a light orchestral valse serenade by British composer Eric Coates composed in 1930. In 1940, lyrics were added with Coates's approval by Jack Lawrence, and the resultant song ""Sleepy Lagoon"" became a popular music standard of the 1940s.[http://www.jacklawrencesongwriter.com/songs/sleepy_lagoon.html The Story Behind The Song], jacklawrencesongwriter.com, Retrieved 14 November 2010.

Coates had originally been inspired to write the piece in 1930 while overlooking a beach in West Sussex. His son, Austin Coates, remembers:

It was inspired in a very curious way and not by what you might expect. It was inspired by the view on a warm, still summer evening looking across the ""lagoon"" from the east beach at Selsey towards Bognor Regis. It's a pebble beach leading steeply down, and the sea at that time is an incredibly deep blue of the Pacific. It was that impression, looking across at Bognor, which looked pink — almost like an enchanted city with the blue of the Downs behind it — that gave him the idea for the Sleepy Lagoon. He didn't write it there; he scribbled it down, as he used to, at extreme speed, and then simply took it back with him to London where he wrote and orchestrated it.""""Eric Coates in Sussex"", [http://www.musicweb-international.com/coates/sussex.htm Transcript of The Enchanted Garden], BBC local radio programme, devised, scripted and produced by Ian Lace. Available on MusicWeb, Retrieved 14 November 2010.

The resultant piece is a slow waltz for full orchestra lasting roughly four minutes in duration. Michael Jameson suggests that the piece is ""elegantly orchestrated"" with ""a shapely theme for violins presented in the salon-esque genre entirely characteristic of British light music in the 1920s and '30s"".  In 1942, Coates's original orchestral version was chosen (with added seagulls) to introduce the BBC Home Service radio series Desert Island Discs, which it still does to this day on BBC Radio 4. 

""Sleepy Lagoon""

In early 1940, songwriter Jack Lawrence came across the piano solo version of ""By the Sleepy Lagoon"" and wrote a song lyric, then took it to Chappell, the publisher of Coates's original melody. The head of Chappell's New York office, Max Dreyfus, was concerned that this lyric had been added without consulting its famous British classical composer. Dreyfus warned Lawrence that Coates ""may resent your tampering with his melody."" Dreyfus also didn't think the melody belonged in the popular genre and that it was better suited to its original treatment as a light classical piece.

Later that year, Lawrence attempted to contact Coates in person. Britain was in the middle of World War II, and contrary to Dreyfus' fears, Coates thought the lyrics fitted so well that he retorted he could hardly believe it had been written to a pre-existing melody:

You have set the words to my music so cleverly that one would never suspect that the music had been written first!""
 
The resulting song was published as a collaboration of Lawrence and Coates. After Lawrence showed the song to bandleader Harry James, it was recorded for a major hit (again counter to Dreyfus' thoughts). The James recording was released by Columbia Records as catalog number 36549. It first reached the Billboard Best Seller chart on 17 April 1942 and lasted 18 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 1.

Other hit versions were recorded by Dinah Shore, David Rose, Fred Waring, Glenn Miller and others. A recording with Tom Jenkins and his Palm Court Orchestra was made in London on 15 March 1949. It was released by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalogue number B 9768. Peter Kreuder, piano with rhythm recorded the tune in 1949. The song made the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960, in a version by the Platters, found originally on the flipside of the 1960 top ten ""Harbor Lights"".  A Khmer language version was apparently recorded in the 1960s.

In 2012, the musical piece became the main musical theme of the water fountain spectacle Aquanura at the Dutch theme park Efteling. Aquanura is the third largest permanent fountain show in the world and the largest in Europe. As the show is performed nightly on a large lake, the creaters used ""By the Sleepy Lagoon"" as an introduction and linking melody throughout the show. The musical piece was partly rearranged and rerecorded by the Dutch Brabant Orchestra especially for the show.

beyond the pale - Wiktionary
beyond the pale
Etymology[ edit ]
From pale ‎(“jurisdiction of an authority, territory under an authority's jurisdiction”), suggesting that anything outside the authority's jurisdiction was uncivilized. The phrase was in use by the mid-17th century, and may be a reference to the general sense of boundary, but is often understood to refer specifically to the English Pale in Ireland. In the nominally English territory of Ireland, only the Pale fell genuinely under the authority of English law, hence the terms within the pale and beyond the pale. The boundary of the Ashdown Forest (a royal hunting forest) was also known as the Pale, consisting of a paled fence and a ditch inside, to allow deer to jump in, but not back out.

""Block Buster!"" (also sometimes listed as ""Blockbuster!"") is a 1973 single by Sweet. Written by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, and produced by Phil Wainman, ""Block Buster!"" was the band's sole UK No. 1 hit. Released in January 1973, it spent five weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart,  and also made #1 in the Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Austria and Ireland, and #3 in Finland, Switzerland, Denmark and Norway. Outside Europe it fared less well as it peaked at #29 in Australia and at #73 on the American Billboard Hot 100.

Music and lyrics

Its riff was considered markedly similar to fellow RCA act David Bowie's ""The Jean Genie"", released shortly before, but all parties maintain that this was pure coincidence.

Some controversy rose after the band's performance of the song on the British television program Top of the Pops at December 25, 1973. In this performance, Sweet's bassist Steve Priest wore a Swastika.

Caviinae
Caviinae is a subfamily uniting all living members of the family Caviidae with the exception of the maras, capybaras, and Kerodon.  The subfamily traditionally contained the guinea pig-like forms along with the cursorially adapted (running) Kerodon.  Molecular results suggest the Caviinae as so defined would be paraphyletic and Kerodon is more closely related to maras and capybaras than to other caviines.   This led Woods and Kilpatrick (2005) to unite Kerodon and capybaras into the subfamily Hydrochoerinae within the Caviidae. These studies also suggest  Microcavia and Cavia are more closely related to one another than either is to Galea.

Agadoo
""Agadoo"" is a novelty song recorded by the band Black Lace in 1984. ""Agadoo"" peaked at number two in the UK Singles Chart,  and spent 30 weeks in the top 75. It went on to become the eighth best-selling single of 1984 in the UK, despite being banned on BBC Radio 1 because it ""was not credible"".

In a survey for dotmusic in 2000, respondents voted ""Agadoo"" as the fourth most annoying song of all time.  In a poll for Q magazine in 2003, a panel of music writers voted ""Agadoo"" as the worst song of all time, saying: ""It sounded like the school disco you were forced to attend, your middle-aged relatives forming a conga at a wedding party, a travelling DJ act based in Wolverhampton, every party cliche you ever heard.""  The panel also described it as ""magnificently dreadful"".

Origins and recording

The song's origins date back to 1971, when Michel Delancray and Mya Symille recorded it as ""Agadou"" in French.   It had been written based on a tune that had apparently come from Morocco.  Club Med used it as their theme song from 1974.  It was covered by several artists and groups, including Patrick Zabé in 1975 and the Saragossa Band (a German group) in 1981. 

The Black Lace group was made up during its heyday by the duo of performers Dene Michael and Alan Barton. One of the early versions of the song became popular in a Derby nightclub called Gossips, with the bar staff making a novelty dance; when Black Lace performed at the club in 1981, they learnt the dance and recorded their own version, which was the first version in English. This was verified on BBC Radio Derby in 2006.

Black Lace's version of the song was produced by Neil Ferguson at his Woodlands studio under the direction of John Wagstaff and arranged by Barry Whitfield.

Chart performance 

Despite being banned on BBC Radio 1 because it ""was not credible"", the track proved to be a commercial hit. In the UK Singles Chart, ""Agadoo"" debuted at number 86 on 20 May 1984. The song didn't enter the top 40 until the end of July, then peaking at number 38. In its fourth week in the top 40, ""Agadoo"" reached number 2, with George Michael's ""Careless Whisper"" holding it off the top spot. By early November, the song was still in the top 40, but it fell out after the first week in that month. By 13 January 1985, its last appearance in the chart, ""Agadoo"" had spent 35 weeks in the top 100. It was revealed to be the eighth best-selling single of 1984 around that time. Fourteen years after its original release, the song was remixed and re-released. It re-entered the top 100 at number 64 on 16 August 1998, but only stayed in the chart for a week.

The song has found success in other countries as well, such as Ireland, New Zealand and France. In the Irish Singles Chart, the song peaked at number 5, but only spent 5 weeks in the charts overall. ""Agadoo"" spent a longer 11 weeks in the New Zealand Singles Chart, debuting at number 37 on 21 October 1984 and hitting a peak of number 9 in its sixth week. The song fell out the chart quite abruptly, falling 25 places to number 44 in its final appearance in the chart before falling out completely. In the French Singles Chart, the song peaked at number 48 in its first and only week on 17 November 1984.

Parodies and derivative versions

Black Lace themselves recorded an X-rated version of the song entitled ""Have a Screw"", which was written by Black Lace members Alan Barton and [http://www.reverbnation.com/colingibbblacklace Colin Gibb] and released on the B-side of the 12-inch vinyl ""Gang Bang"". 

The Australian satirical TV series CNNNN ran a fake cross-promotion for Agadoo: The Musical.

In 1986, the song was parodied in ""The Chicken Song"" by the satirical television programme Spitting Image.  The track's composer Philip Pope had previously parodied the song as ""Shagadoo"" in Radio Active.

The song was also used as the basis of a chant by fans of Liverpool for defender Daniel Agger.

Anarchist band Chumbawamba recorded a version of ""Agadoo"" for the Peel Sessions. The producer of the Black Lace version, Neil Ferguson, was also Chumbawamba's regular producer at the time and later a full member of the band. 

It was parodied in a Vanilla Mini Wheats commercial in 2006 and by The Maynards in 2013, who recorded a bluegrass version of the song.

In November 2009, Black Lace recorded a version called ""Agadir"" to promote a new air service by easyJet from Gatwick airport to Agadir.

2007 and 2009 re-releases

In August 2007, the ""Agadoo 206 Mix"" was released as the song was used in a TV ad to promote Peugeot's new 206 car. The song hit the UK charts. Black Lace members [http://www.reverbnation.com/colingibbblacklace Colin Gibb] and Rob Hopcraft then used the song for a special charity 'Agadoo Day'.
On 20 March 2009, it was announced that the song was being released in a new version by Dene Michael from Black Lace's original lineup and new member Ian Robinson. A video for the release, titled ""Agadoo"" (Mambo 2009 remix), was directed by Bruce Jones, who played Les Battersby-Brown in television soap opera Coronation Street.

FIRST U.S. MISSILES ARRIVE BY PLANE AT A BRITISH BASE ...
FIRST U.S. MISSILES ARRIVE BY PLANE AT A BRITISH BASE - NYTimes.com
FIRST U.S. MISSILES ARRIVE BY PLANE AT A BRITISH BASE
By JON NORDHEIMER
Published: November 15, 1983
Text of Briton's statement, page A14.
LONDON, Nov. 14 - American- made cruise missiles arrived today at an air base in England, the British Government announced. They are the first of NATO's new generation of medium- range missiles to be deployed in Western Europe.
Britain's Defense Secretary, Michael Heseltine, told a deeply divided House of Commons that the shipment, delivered to Greenham Common air base by a United States plane, meant that an unspecified number of cruise missiles would be operational on schedule by the end of the year.
Shouting to make himself heard over howls of protest from opposition legislators, he said, ''I have to inform the House that earlier today the first cruise missiles were delivered by air.''
'Reckless Cynicism' Charged
Neil Kinnock, the Labor Party leader, accused the Government of ''reckless cynicism'' in permitting deployment while the Soviet Union and the United States are continuing arms negotiations in Geneva.
''The installation of cruise weapons makes Britain a more dangerous place today than it was yesterday,'' Mr. Kinnock said. ''It increases the risk for our country without contributing to the defense of the country.''
Antiwar groups in Britain said tonight that the deployment at Greenham Common would open a new round of protest demonstrations and actions against the missiles.
For her part, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher discussed the missiles' arrival in a speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet in London, saying, ''It is our destiny to be living at a time when there exist weapons of war of a dimension hitherto unknown.''
Arrival Reported in Soviet
The Soviet press reported briefly and without commentary the arrival of the missiles in Britain. Soviet leaders have said that the new American missiles scheduled for deployment across Western Europe would make a continuation of the arms negotiations with the United States in Geneva impossible. But diplomats in Moscow noted that the last statement by Yuri V. Andropov, the Soviet leader, was ambivalent on whether bringing missiles into Europe or actually deploying them would be cause for a Soviet walkout. (Page A15.)
The arrival of the missiles at Greenham Common, a Royal Air Force base used by the United States about 50 miles west of London in the heart of Berkshire, came two weeks after the House of Commons, after a heated debate, voted overwhelmingly to go ahead with deployment. The delivery of mobile launchers and other components of the cruise system began immediately.
Next week, the West German Parliament is to hold its debate on the stationing of the American missiles. The Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl has a comfortable parliamentary majority that is expected to approve deployment of the systems, which are scheduled to be operational by Dec. 15.
The cruise missiles delivered to Britain today are among 41 weapons that are to be deployed in initial deliveries to Britain, Italy and West Germany by the first of next year. By then, both Britain and Italy are to receive 16 cruise missiles, while West Germany is to receive nine Pershing 2 ballistic missiles.   572 Missiles by 1988
The 41 weapons are the first of 572 cruise and Pershing missiles that are to be deployed by 1988. All of the Pershing 2's will go to West Germany; the additional cruise missiles will be deployed not only in Britain and Italy but also in Belgium and the Netherlands.
The arrival of the missiles came after 3 years and 11 months of efforts by the North Atlantic allies to get the Soviet Union to agree to remove the SS-20 medium-range missiles it placed on its frontiers in the late 1970's. According to figures given to Parliament today by Mr. Heseltine, the Russians have increased the number of SS-20's confronting Europe from 81 in 1979 to 252 today. The United States Air Force puts the current total at more than 260.
West Germany is scheduled to begin deploying the first components of 108 Pershing 2 ballistic missiles later this month and Italy is preparing sites for the first of the 112 cruise missiles it has agreed to take. Deployment of a total of 96 cruise missiles by the Netherlands and Belguium is still contingent on final approval by the governments of those countries and will not take place until a year or more after most of the missiles in Britain, Germany and Italy are operational.
The cruise missile is essentially a small, pilotless aircraft that carries an explosive warhead, conventional or nuclear. It is called a cruise missile because it cruises like an airplane rather than being fired into a trajectory like a ballistic missile.
Powered by Light Engine
It has a navigational system and is powered by a light turbofan engine rather than by the rockets that drive ballistic missiles, and has a range of 1,500 miles. The Pershing 2, by comparison, is a ballistic missile with a range of 1,100 miles. Soviet officials have made clear that they are more concerned about the Pershings, with their great accuracy and speed, than with the slower, ground-hugging cruise.

Passage:
Anton Geesink
Antonius Johannes ""Anton"" Geesink (April 6, 1934 – August 27, 2010) was a Dutch 10th-dan judoka from Utrecht. He was a two-time World Judo Champion (1961 and 1965), Olympic Gold Medalist (1964) and won 21 European championships.

Judo career

Geesink first participated in the European Championships in 1951, and placed second in his category. The following year, he won his first European title. Through to 1967, twenty more European titles followed.

At the 1956 World Championships, Geesink was eliminated in the semi-finals against Yoshihiko Yoshimatsu.  At the 1961 World Championships, Geesink, then 5th dan,  became World Champion in the open class, defeating the Japanese champion Koji Sone. Japanese judokas had won all the World Championship titles contested up to that point.

Judo debuted as an official sport at the 1964 Summer Olympics, which were held in the sport's home country, Japan. Although Japan dominated three of the four weight divisions (light, middle and heavy), Anton Geesink won the final of the open weight division, defeating Akio Kaminaga in front of his home crowd.  

After winning the 1965 World Championships and a last European title in 1967, Geesink quit competitive judo.

Anton Geesink was one of the few 10th Dan grade judoka (jūdan) recognized by the IJF but not by Kodokan at that rank. Promotions from 6th to 10th Dan are awarded for services to the sport of judo. In 2010 there are three living 10th dan grade judoka (jūdan) recognized by Kodokan: Toshiro Daigo, Ichiro Abe and Yoshimi Osawa. The Kodokan has not awarded the 10th Dan to anybody outside Japan.

Professional wrestling career

In October 1973, All Japan Pro Wrestling owner Giant Baba recruited Anton Geesink to join AJPW. Baba sent him to Amarillo, TX and Dory Funk Jr. and Terry Funk trained him for a month. He worked for All Japan from 1973 to 1978, as a popular part-timer.

Geesink's notable professional wrestling opponents included Bruno Sammartino, Gorilla Monsoon, Dick Murdoch, Dory Funk Jr., Bobby Duncum, Bob Remus (Sgt. Slaughter), Don Leo Jonathan, and Jumbo Tsuruta.

International Olympic Committee work

In 1987, he became a member of the board of the Dutch National Olympic Committee, and a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

Geesink was among the IOC members suspected of accepting bribes during the scandal surrounding the election of Salt Lake City as the host of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Geesink's name was cleared by the IOC which nevertheless issued him a warning for the appearance of a conflict of interest which could have damaged the reputation of the IOC.

Honors

Geesink was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the Japanese government in 1997.  

His home town of Utrecht has a street named after him — which is the street he lived on for some time up until his death in August 2010.

On January 29, 2000, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Kokushikan University, a Japanese university known for its sport education and of which four alumni are Olympic gold medalists in judo, with the following praise: 

ヘーシンク氏は、一九六四年東京オリンピックにおいて、柔道無差別級で外国人選手として初めて金メダルを獲得し、その後、武道精神をもって国際平和に貢献するとともにオランダ・日本両国民の文化交流・友好関係の促進に努め、また柔道を教育学や生体学的角度から研究し、その普及発展のために尽力された。
武道の精神を重視する本大学は、柔道の国際的普及における同氏の功績を讃え、国士舘大学名誉博士の学位を贈呈した。

At the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Mr. Geesink won the gold medal in the open class as the first non-Japanese. Since then, with the spirit of budō, he has contributed to the international peace and promoted the cultural exchange and friendship between the people of the Netherlands and of Japan. Furthermore, he explored judo in light of education and somatology and has been devoted to its diffusion and development. To honor his contribution to the worldwide diffusion of judo, this university, as a body which prizes the spirit of budō, awarded him an honorary doctorate of Kokushikan University.

Passage:
Tinikling
Tinikling is a traditional Philippine dance which originated during the Spanish colonial era.  The dance involves two people beating, tapping, and sliding bamboo poles on the ground and against each other in coordination with one or more dancers who step over and in between the poles in a dance. It is traditionally danced to rondalla music, a sort of serenade played by an ensemble of stringed instruments which originated in Spain during the Middle Ages.

History 

The name ""tinikling"" is a reference to birds locally known as tikling, which can be any of a number of rail species; the term tinikiling literally means ""tikling-like."" 

The dance originated in Leyte, an island in the Visayas in the central Philippines. It imitates the movement of the tikling birds as they walk between grass stems, run over tree branches, or dodge bamboo traps set by rice farmers. Dancers imitate the tikling bird's legendary grace and speed by skillfully maneuvering between large bamboo poles. 

Legend has it that tinikling originated during the Spanish rule of the Philippines, when natives worked on large plantations under the control of the King of Spain. Those who didn't work productively were punished by standing between two bamboo poles, some of which were adorned with thorns . To avoid being clapped in the ankles by the sticks, the natives would jump in and out of the sticks as they neared their feet. Thus, the movements of the dance were created  This however, is a mere legend and has no historical basis.

Today tinikling is taught throughout the United States. In grades K-12 the dance is used as an aerobic exercise for physical education classes, to help expand physical movements such as hand coordination, foot speed, and also rhythm. Tinikling is commonly performed on special occasions such as the Filipino Independence Day as a celebration of Filipino culture and Filipino pride.
 

The dance 

The bamboo is used as a percussive instrument as it is banged against the ground (or a piece of wood to make it easier to hold) and each other in a pattern. The bamboo has to be closed hard enough to make a sound, and the dancers must be quick enough to not get their foot (or feet) caught. As the dance continues, the banging of the bamboo becomes faster and harder, the sound of the clashing bamboo and the quickness of feet demonstrated by the dancers thrilling the crowd.

For this traditional folk dance, females wear a dress called balintawak or patadyong, and males wear an untucked embroidered shirt called the barong tagalog. The balintawak are colorful dresses with wide arched sleeves and the patadyong is a pineapple fiber blouse paired with checkered skirts. The barong Tagalog uniform is usually lightweight long sleeved shirts and worn with red trousers. Dancers wear no footwear while performing. 

When performed by dance troupes or in cultural shows, Tinikling is typically performed in the ""Rural Suite,"" which includes dances originating from Filipino Christians that have a more ""folksy"" character.  These dances originae mostly from the islands of Visayas and Luzon and imitate the simplicity and joy of the lifestyle of the Filipino villagers living in those regions.  Other filipino folk dances of this category include Sayaw sa Bangko, Maglalatik, and Pandanggo sa Ilaw.

In the United States, this dance has been altered into a four-beat rhythm to adjust to popular music. In some cases, it has been used in conjunction with traditional Filipino martial arts to demonstrate fleetness of foot and flow of movement.  As mentioned earlier, tinikling is used as aerobic exercise for physical education classes in the United States for grades K-12. Instead of using traditional bamboo poles, most schools create their poles using plastic PVC pipe or wooden dowels.  Another alternative is to tie elastic bands to the ankles of two students. The two students switch between jumping with their feet apart and their feet together to simulate the movement of the wooden poles. This way, more students are engaged in the aerobic exercise, rather than just the dancer. 

Similar dances are found throughout Asia, such as the Cheraw dance from India, Múa Sạp from Vietnam, Lao Kra Top Mai from Thailand, Robam Kom Araek from Cambodia, Karen or Chin Bamboo Dance from Myanmar, Alai Sekap in Brunei, Ami Bamboo Dance from Taiwan, and Magunatip from Sabah, East Malaysia.

Vicente I. De Veyra compiled tinikling music in his book, Mga Ambahan.

Wilkins Micawber
Wilkins Micawber is a fictional character from Charles Dickens's 1850 novel, David Copperfield.  He was modelled on Dickens' father, John Dickens, who like Micawber was incarcerated in debtors' prison (the King's Bench Prison) after failing to meet his creditors' demands.

Micawber's long-suffering wife, Emma, stands by him despite his financial exigencies that force her to pawn all of her family's heirlooms.  She lives by the maxims, ""I will never desert Mr. Micawber!"" and ""Experientia does it!"" (from Experientia docet, ""One learns by experience."")
 
Micawber is hired as a clerk by the scheming Uriah Heep, who assumes wrongly that Micawber's debts arise from dishonesty.  But working for Heep allows Micawber to expose his boss as a forger and a cheat. To start anew, Micawber and his family emigrate to Australia with Daniel Peggotty and Little Em'ly, where Micawber becomes manager of the Port Middlebay Bank and a successful government magistrate.

In Hablot Knight Browne's illustrations for the first edition, Micawber is shown wearing knee-breeches, a top hat, and a monocle.

Popular culture

Micawber is known for asserting his faith that ""something will turn up"".  His name has become synonymous with someone who lives in hopeful expectation.  This has formed the basis for the Micawber Principle, based upon his observation:

""Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds nought and six, result misery."" - (Chapter 12)

[The amounts quoted are equivalent to £20, £19 97½p and £20 2½p, in the United Kingdom's present, decimal, currency.]

The character was played by W.C. Fields in the 1935 screen classic, Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger.  Bob Hoskins took the role in a 1999 BBC serial.

Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones named one of his guitars (an early 1950s Fender Telecaster with a Gibson PAF humbucking pickup installed in the neck position) ""Micawber"". Richards is known to be a fan of Dickens. Of the unusual moniker attached to the instrument, Richards said, ""There's no reason for my guitar being called Micawber, apart from the fact that it's such an unlikely name. There's no one around me called Micawber, so when I scream for Micawber everyone knows what I'm talking about.""

In addition, the character formed the basis of Micawber, a 2001 ITV drama series written by John Sullivan and starring David Jason in the title leading role.

In the U.S. Supreme Court opinion of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 562 (2007), Justice Souter criticized the court below for an approach to pleading that ""would dispense with any showing of a reasonably founded hope that a plaintiff would be able to make a case; Mr. Micawber's optimism would be enough."" (quotations and citations omitted).

Entry into general English

The character of Wilkins Micawber has given rise to the English noun ""Micawber"" and the adjectives ""Micawberish"" and ""Micawberesque"". The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a Micawber as ""one who is poor but lives in optimistic expectation of better fortune"".  Judge David Halpern described Craig Whyte's legal arguments in a case heard in 2013 as ""pure Micawberism"". 

Quotations

Besides the Micawber Principle, Micawber is notable for a number of memorable quotations:
* I have no doubt I shall, please Heaven, begin to be more beforehand with the world, and to live in a perfectly new manner, if -if, in short, anything turns up. - (Chapter 1)
* Every happiness and prosperity! If, in the progress of revolving years, I could persuade myself that my blighted destiny had been a warning to you, I should feel that I had not occupied another man's place altogether in vain. - (Chapter 12)
* You HEEP of infamy! - (Chapter 52)
* I trust that the labour and hazard of an investigation -of which the smallest results have been slowly pieced together, in the pressure of arduous avocations, under grinding penurious apprehensions, at rise of morn, at dewy eve, in the shadows of night, under the watchful eye of one whom it were superfluous to call Demon, combined with the struggle of parental Poverty to turn it, when completed, to the right account, may be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet water on my funeral pyre.  I ask no more. Let it be, in justice, merely said of me, as of a gallant and eminent Naval Hero, with whom I have no pretensions to cope, that what I have done, I did, in despite of mercenary and selfish objectives, ""FOR ENGLAND, HOME AND BEAUTY."" Remaining always, &c, &c, Wilkins Micawber.
* Welcome poverty!..Welcome misery, welcome houselessness, welcome hunger, rags, tempest, and beggary! Mutual confidence will sustain us to the end!

Film and television portrayals

Quotations from the 1935 film

*Boy, as I have frequently had occasion to observe: ""When the stomach is empty, the spirits are low!""
* Remember my motto ""Nil Desperandum! -Never despair!""

* (featuring Bob Hoskins as Micawber) ""I could not depart this metropolis without paying a valedictory visit to my dear friend Copperfield, in whose debt I shall forever remain (I speak metaphorically of course!)""

Passage:
Mary Had a Little Lamb
""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" is an English language nursery rhyme of nineteenth-century American origin. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 7622.

Background

The nursery rhyme was first published by the Boston publishing firm Marsh, Capen & Lyon, as an original poem by Sarah Josepha Hale on May 24, 1830, and was inspired by an actual incident. 

As a young girl, Mary Sawyer (later Mary Tyler) kept a pet lamb that she took to school one day at the suggestion of her brother.  A commotion naturally ensued. Mary recalled: ""Visiting school that morning was a young man by the name of John Roulstone, a nephew of the Reverend Lemuel Capen, who was then settled in Sterling. It was the custom then for students to prepare for college with ministers, and for this purpose Roulstone was studying with his uncle. The young man was very much pleased with the incident of the lamb; and the next day he rode across the fields on horseback to the little old schoolhouse and handed me a slip of paper which had written upon it the three original stanzas of the poem..."" 

There are two competing theories on the origin of this poem.  One holds that Roulstone wrote the first four lines and that the final twelve lines, less childlike than the first, were composed by Sarah Josepha Hale; the other is that Hale was responsible for the entire poem. 

Mary Sawyer's house, located in Sterling, Massachusetts, was destroyed by arson on August 12, 2007.   A statue representing Mary's Little Lamb stands in the town center.  The Redstone School, which was built in 1798, was purchased by Henry Ford and relocated to a churchyard on the property of Longfellow's Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Massachusetts.

The rhyme is also famous for being the first thing recorded by Thomas Edison on his newly invented phonograph in 1877. It was the first instance of recorded verse. In 1927, Edison reenacted the recording, which still survives.  The earliest recording (1878) was retrieved by 3-D imaging equipment in 2012. 

Blues musicians Buddy Guy and Stevie Ray Vaughan both popularized the song in their own albums: Guy composing his own bluesy version of the song for his album A Man and the Blues in 1968 and Vaughan covering Guy's version in his 1983 debut album, Texas Flood, with both also infusing the first four lines of the nursery rhyme, ""A-Tisket, A-Tasket"", into the song. In 1972, Paul McCartney released a version of the song. Just as he had done with the 16th-century poem Golden Slumbers which was released on The Beatles' Abbey Road LP in 1969, he added his own melody to the lyrics. The single was a top 20 hit in Britain although both the choice for and the saccharine arrangement of ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" did much to erode his standing with leading rock journalists. McCartney played the song during Wings' 1972 summer tour and it was included in the Spring 1973 James Paul McCartney television special. It is commercially available on the 1993 CD issue of the Wings Wild Life LP.

Text

In the 1830s, Lowell Mason set the nursery rhyme to a melody adding repetition in the verses:

Mary had a little lamb,
His fleece was white as snow,
And everywhere that Mary went,
The lamb was sure to go.

He followed her to school one day,
Which was against the rule,
It made the children laugh and play
To see a lamb at school.

And so the teacher turned it out,
But still it lingered near,
And waited patiently about,
Till Mary did appear.

""Why does the lamb love Mary so?""
The eager children cry.
""Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know,""
The teacher did reply.

Note: This melody is the British version, which is slightly different from the American version.
Question:
According to the nursery rhyme, whose lamb followed her to school?

Mary (album)
Passage:
Soleirolia
Soleirolia soleirolii (,  syn. Helxine soleirolii) is a plant in the nettle family.  It has a number of common names, including baby's tears, angel's tears, mind-your-own-business, peace-in-the-home, pollyanna vine, polly prim, mother of thousands,  and the Corsican curse. It has also been called Irish moss; however, it is not a moss, nor should it be confused with Sagina subulata or Chondrus crispus (an alga), which are also known as ""Irish moss"". 

Description

It is a delicate-looking creeping herb with juicy bright green or yellow leaves and multitudes of tiny white flowers. It grows close to the ground in mats and is sometimes used in ornamental gardens alongside ferns and other moisture-loving types of plant.

The leaves are usually slightly stalked, about 5 mm across. The minute flowers produce oval seeds. 

Distribution

This species is native to the northern Mediterranean region in and around Italy and nearby islands, but it has been introduced and cultivated nearly worldwide as an ornamental and garden plant. 

Habitat

It can be grown indoors as a houseplant and used in habitats for amphibians. It prefers shade and moderate moisture. It can even grow submersed in swampy environments.  In colder regions the plant dies back during winter, but it returns with lush growth as the temperature increases. It is capable of vegetative reproduction, so to eradicate it once it has become established in an area, the entire plant must be removed, or else it can sprout new growth. It is a common weed in many places.  Nurseries grow several varieties, including gold, yellow, and white breeds, but the mossy-green type is most popular with gardeners.

This species, the only member of the monotypic genus, Soleirolia,  was named after Joseph-François Soleirol by Esprit Requien. Soleirol, an amateur botanist, originally collected the plant in Corsica.
Question:
The plant soleirolia soleirolii of the nettle family has a number of common names, including baby's tears, angel's tears, mind-your-own-business, peace-in-the-home, pollyanna vine, the Corsican curse, Irish moss and which other?
Answer:
Mother of thousands

1998 Winter Olympics
The 1998 Winter Olympics, officially the , was a winter multi-sport event celebrated from 7 to 22 February 1998 in Nagano, Japan.

72 nations and 2,176 participants contested in 7 sports and 68 events at 15 venues. The Games saw the introduction of women's ice hockey, curling and snowboarding. National Hockey League players were allowed to participate in the men's ice hockey.

The host was selected on June 15, 1991, over Salt Lake City, Östersund, Jaca and Aosta. They were the third Olympic Games and second winter Olympics to be held in Japan, after the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo. Nagano is so far the southernmost city to host a Winter Olympics, next to Squaw Valley, host of the 1960 Winter Olympics. The games were succeeded by the 1998 Winter Paralympics from 5 to 14 March. These were the final Winter Olympic Games under the IOC Presidency of  Juan Antonio Samaranch.

Host city selection

Other candidate cities for the 1998 Olympics were Aosta, Italy; Jaca, Spain; Östersund, Sweden; and Salt Lake City, United States. The host city selection was held in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 15 June 1991, at the 97th IOC session. Nagano prevailed over Salt Lake City by just 4 votes. In June 1995, Salt Lake was chosen as the host of the following 2002 Winter Olympics.

Mascots

Sukki, Nokki, Lekki and Tsukki, also known as the Snowlets are the 1998 Winter Olympic mascots and are four snowy owls. They represent respectively fire (Sukki), air (Nokki), earth (Lekki) and water (Tsukki) and together they represent the four major islands of Japan.

Highlights

Bjørn Dæhlie won 3 gold medals in cross-country skiing, making him the Winter Olympic competitor with the most wins ever. Alpine skier Hermann Maier survived a fall in the downhill and went on to win gold in the super-G and giant slalom. Netherlands won 5 of the 10 speed skating events, including 2 each by Gianni Romme and Marianne Timmer. Canada beat Denmark in the women's curling final, securing the latter their first Winter Olympic medal ever.

* Women's ice hockey was contested at the Olympic Games for the first time ever, and the United States beat the Canadians 3–1 for the gold medal. United States went undefeated in the women's tournament. The Czech Republic defeated Russia by a score of 1–0 for the men's gold medal, while Finland won both the men's and women's bronze medals for ice hockey.
* Cross-country skier Bjørn Dæhlie of Norway won three gold medals in Nordic skiing to become the first winter Olympian to earn eight career gold medals and twelve total medals.
* Curling returned as an official sport, after having been demoted to a demonstration event after the inaugural Winter Games in Chamonix in 1924.
* Snowboarding debuted as an official sport.

100m Olympics history - from Jesse Owens to Usain Bolt ...
100m Olympics history - from Jesse Owens to Usain Bolt | Daily Mail Online
comments
The men’s 100 metres final has been the blue riband event at every Olympic Games, generating the greatest hype and excitement.
It is an event done and dusted in 10 seconds or less, but it carries a great history and dozens of stories.
Times have tumbled over the decades, with Jim Hines the first athlete to run under ten seconds in an Olympic final in 1968.
History men: Jesse Owens (left) was the golden boy in 1936, while Usain Bolt ruled in 2008
But the advance from cinder to rubberized artificial tracks, the advent of hi-tech running spikes and kits, and the fact that Olympic sprinters now devote their entire year to training help to ever lower records.
We will have to wait and see if the current world record of 9.58 seconds, held by Usain Bolt, will be bettered in London.
But in the meantime, enjoy these video clips of every Olympic 100m final from Berlin in 1936 to the last Olympics in Beijing.
 
2008 Beijing - Usain Bolt (Jamaica) 9.69
The uncatchable Bolt smashes the world and Olympic records and is so far ahead with 30 metres to go, he cruises over the finish line before celebrating in trademark fashion.
2004 Athens - Justin Gatlin (USA) 9.85
The American Gatlin runs a great race but is almost caught on the line by Portugal’s Francis Obikwelu and his compatriot Maurice Greene. His celebration must also be one of the most reserved in Olympic 100m history. 
2000 Sydney - Maurice Greene (USA) 9.87
Following a false start, Greene bursts through the centre to win by a clear margin, an achievement that obviously overwhelms him.
1996 Atlanta - Donovan Bailey (CAN) 9.84
High drama in Atlanta as Britain’s Linford Christie, the defending champion, is disqualified for two false starts. After 10 minutes, the race finally gets underway with Bailey storming from behind to win. 
1992 Barcelona - Linford Christie (GBR) 9.96
A great moment for British athletics as Christie, at 32, became the oldest Olympic 100m champion, just edging out Frankie Fredericks of Namibia.
1988 Seoul - Ben Johnson (CAN) 9.79 (*later disqualified)
Johnson wins by some distance – and sets a new world record – but is stripped of the title two days later after the post-race drug test indicated steroid use. Carl Lewis, who came in second, was awarded the gold medal.
1984 Los Angeles - Carl Lewis (USA) 9.99
The long limbs of Lewis carry him away from his rivals to win the first of four gold medals at the Los Angeles Games.
1980 Moscow - Alan Wells (GBR) 10.25
The tightest of 100m wins as Wells and Cuba’s Silvio Leonard cross the line in a photo finish, locked on the same time of 10.25.
1976 Montreal - Hasely Crawford (TRI) 10.06
Crawford, in the inside lane, just holds off the challenge of Jamaican Don Quarrie to win the gold and make amends for the 1972 final, when he pulled up and didn’t finish.
1972 Munich - Valeriy Borzov (SOV) 10.14
Borzov, from the Soviet Union, claims a fairly comfortable victory and, with Robert Taylor of the United States second, a small Cold War success.
1968 Mexico City - Jim Hines (USA) 9.95
Hines dominates this race in Mexico City, setting a sub-10 second time which was equal to the world record at the time. This was the first Olympics held on an artificial ‘Tartan’ track. 
1964 Tokyo - Bob Hayes (USA) 10.0
Running on a churned-up cinder track in spikes he had to borrow after his were lost, Hayes ran ten seconds flat to equal the then world record.
1960 Rome - Armin Hary (GER) 10.2
Only six in the final in Rome, as the German Hary, running in the outside lane, took gold on the line from Dave Sime of the United States. Britain’s Peter Radford was third.
1956 Melbourne - Bobby Morrow (USA) 10.62
Morrow achieved great fame in the States after winning a hat-trick of gold medals in Melbourne, of which the 100m was the first.
1952 Helsinki - Lindy Remigino (USA) 10.79
In a thrilling final, Remigino appears to lunge forward over the line, thinking he had won. But Jamaica’s Herb McKenley was right behind him and almost took glory. The officials took some time deciding, but handed it to Remigino. All six runners were separated by just a tenth of a second. 
1948 London - Harrison Dillard (USA) 10.3
It’s hard to tell from the video, but this final was a dead heat between Dillard, who was actually a hurdles specialist, and another American Barney Ewell. The photograph on the line showed a win for Dillard by the narrowest of margins.
1936 Berlin - Jesse Owens (USA) 10.3
In these incredible video clips, we see the great Jessie Owens winning his four gold medals in Berlin as an unimpressed Adolf Hitler looks on.
Question:
Who became the oldest Olympic 100 metres Champion when he won Gold in 1980?
Answer:
A.P. Wells

The album was the band's first number one, and became their biggest seller. It has been certified 6x Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry for sales of over 1.8 million copies. It was voted the 86th greatest album of all time by Q magazine readers in 1998. It is one of only two Texas albums (along with The Greatest Hits) to be certified6x Platinum in the United Kingdom. Worldwide, sales of White on Blondes are estimated at around 4-5 million copies, with sales in France peaking at #2 on the French Album Charts. In a Gallup poll for the Daily Telegraph in 1997, 77% of rural dwellers disapproved of fox hunting. In 2001, 83% of people in the UK think unnecessary hunting is cruel and barbaric. In 2010, White onBlonde was nominated in the BRIT Awards Best Album in the past 25 years. The band has released five singles, including ""Say What You Want (All Day, Every Day)"" - a new version of the 1997 hit featuring additional rap vocals by the Wu-Tang Clan. The single was released as a double A-sided single with ""Say How You Want"" and ""Put Your Arms Around Me"" The band have also released the single ""Halo"" and the album ""Black Eyed Boy"" The album has been nominated for a number of awards, including a Grammy, a Brit Award, and a BAFTAs award. The group have released two singles since the release of the album: ""Put your arms around me"" (UK #10) and ""Insane"" ( UK #4) The band's last single was ""Hale"" (US #10), which was released in November 2004. The song was released on the album's re-issue as a single with the single 'Halo' (UK No. 1). The album also appeared on the soundtrack to the film ""The Godfather"" (U.S. A.D.E.A.R. and UK No. 2). The band also released a single, ""BlackEyed Boy,"" which peaked at #5 on the UK charts in December 2004. In the U.S., the album was also a major success in various European countries, such as France where it peaked at No.1 on the German Album Ch charts. In 2007, the band released a second album, ""Texas,"" which was produced by the band themselves, along with Mike Hedges and former Eurythmics star Dave Stewart. Pro-hunters claim that their pastime is not cruel and helps to rid the countryside of predatory pests. In fact foxes feed mainly on rabbits and rats – a benefit to farmers. English landowners have consistently damaged the English countryside in favour of profits and subsidies. Their gamekeepers trap and poison birds of prey to protect their pheasants. Their sheep are dipped in noxious chemicals which poison farmworkers, rivers and fish. They don’t actually want to attract hoi polloi, the ordinary people, in any numbers to enjoy rural pursuits. They expect our sympathy for their civil liberty to chase freely over the countryside in pursuit of foxes, but don't any of us dare to go for a walk across their land!Barnaby Mitchell: The myth of the 'Hippomenes' courtship of Atalanta and Servius, narrated by Pseollodorus, Ovid, Servius and Hyginus, follows Ovid’s tale of the ‘unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable’? If so, which ‘sport’ do you think Oscar Wilde described as ‘The unspeakable’ and why? If you’re a fox hunter, the answer is ‘Fox-hunter’. If you are not a foxhunter, the question is: ‘What do you like to do with your time?’ If you want to know the answer, you can go to foxhunting.org.uk and search for ‘Hippomanes’ or ‘Atalanta’, the main character in the Greek myth. The name Hippomenes may also refer to the father of Leimone. He was known to have been one of the disciples of Cheiron, and to have surpassed other disciples in his eagerness to undertake hard challenges. In Greek mythology, he was a son of the Arcadian Amphidamas or of Megareus of Onchestus, and the husband of AtALanta. In the main myth, he is said to have fallen in love with the Calydonian huntsman, Atalantus. He is also known as the son of Melanion, and may have been a disciple of the Greek philosopher, Plato. See No Evil, Hear No Evil is a 1989 American comedy film directed by Arthur Hiller and produced by Marvin Worth for TriStar Pictures. It stars Richard Pryor as a blind man and Gene Wilder as a deaf man who work together to thwart a trio of murderous thieves. This is the third film reuniting Wilder and Pryor who had appeared previously in Silver Streak (1976) and Stir Crazy (1980) The film is based on the Greek myth of Atalanta, the virgin huntress who disliked the idea of getting married and ran races against her suitors to prove she would never lose. The blind man, Wally Karew, and the deaf man, Dave Lyons, meet when Wally applies for a job in Dave's New York City concession shop. Wally and Dave become close friends, and Wally tells Dave about invisible sounds and what people say behind his back. In the film, Wally defeats an aggressive bully in a fistfight with assistance from Dave, who uses clock-face directions to tell Wally where his opponent is. When the man is approached by a beautiful woman named Eve (Joan Severance), he quickly removes a gold coin from a suitcase and places it in a box of coins sitting on the counter. The woman takes the suitcase and shoots the man in the stomach, but he neither sees nor hears the shooting. Wally then rushes to the man's dead body and picks up the gun, which Eve had left at the scene, which he then picks up and leaves the shop. The film was released on November 14, 1989. It is the second film to be released by TriStar, the third by Paramount, the fourth by Troma and the sixth by Criterion. It was released in UK cinemas on November 21, 1989, and in Australia on November 22, 1989,. The film has been released in the UK on November 23, 2009, and  in the U.S. on November 24, 2009. The UK release date for the film is November 25, 2009; the US release date is November 26, 2009 (the UK release dates for the UK release are November 27, 2009 and November 28, 2009). The U.K. release date of the film has not yet been released, but it is expected to be in cinemas in the United States on November 30, 2010, and possibly in Europe on November 29, 2010. Dave Lyons (Gene Wilder) and Wally Karew (Wallace ""Wally"" Karew) are framed for the murder of Eve (Kevin Spacey) Eve and her accomplice Kirgo (Alan North) try to bail them out by posing as attorneys. They steal an unattended police car, and drive away with Eve, Kirgo and Braddock chasing them. Dave and Wally evade both the police and the criminals, but they accidentally launch the car onto a waterborne garbage barge. The two men go to a local park and reprise a scene from the beginning of the film by dumping ice-cream cones on each other's head. See No Evil, Hear No Evil premiered on May 1989 to mostly negative reviews. Roger Ebert called it ""a real dud"",  the Deseret Morning News described the film as ""stupid"", with an ""idiotic script"" that had a ""contrived story"" and too many ""juvenile gags"" The film holds 18% of positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite negative reviews, the film was a box office success for its time, able to stay at number one for two week. It was a co-starring vehicle for ""Mr. Pryor and Mr. Wilder"", while also acknowledging that ""this is not elegant movie making, and not all of the gags are clever,"" Vincent Canby called it 'by far the most successful co- starring vehicle' for Mr. Pryor, ""by far"" the ""most successful vehicle"" for Wilder and ""the most successful"" for Pryor,  Vincent Canby called it ""by far the most successful vehicle for Mr.Wilder and Pryor on the box office at the same time in 1989 as ""The Godfather and The Godfather 2"". The film was released on May 25, 1989, by TriStar Pictures, and was directed by Robert De Niro. The film is based on a true story about two men who try to steal a coin from a bank. It has been released on Blu-ray and DVD in the U.S. and in the UK. Long Walk to Freedom is an autobiographical work written by Nelson Mandela. The book profiles his early life, education and 27 years in prison. Under the apartheid government, Mandela was regarded as a terrorist and jailed on Robben Island for his role as a leader of the then-outlawed ANC. He has since achieved international recognition for his leadership as president in rebuilding the country's once segregated society. The last chapters of the book describe his political ascension, and his belief that the struggle continues against apartheid in South Africa. Mandela dedicated his book to'my six children, Madiba and Makaziwe (my first daughter) who are now deceased, and to my twenty-one grandchildren and three great-grandchildren who give me great pleasure' Unlike his biographer Anthony Sampson, Mandela does not accuse the warder James Gregory of fabricating a friendship with his prisoner. Gregory's book Goodbye Bafana discussed Mandela's family life and described Gregory as a close personal friend of Mandela. According to Mandela: The Authorised Biography, Gregory's position was to censor the letters delivered to the future president, and he thereby discovered the details of Mandela's personal life, which he then made money from by means of his book. Mandela considered suing Gregory for this breach of trust, but decided not to do so because he was a friend of his prisoner, not a co-conspirator in the struggle for freedom. The author is also known for his work as a playwright and director, including the 1989 film ‘See No Evil, Hear No Evil’. He is the inspiration for the TV series ‘Nelson Mandela’s Long Walk To Freedom’, which is based on the book and was released in 1995 by Little Brown & Co. The film was based on a book written by Mandela himself, and was directed by Robert De Niro, who was also the director of ‘The Godfather’ and ‘ The Godfather: Part II’ (1998). The book is available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom won the Alan Paton Award in 1995. It has been published in numerous languages, including an Afrikaans translation. The East Lyn is a river which rises high in Exmoor, in the English county of Somerset.

The Most Luxurious Al Jumeirah Hotel in the Arab World has a 0.00% daily rate excluding taxes & AED fees. The hotel is located in the city of Burj Al Arab, the most affluent Arab city in the Middle East, and has a 1,000-room hotel complex. It is located on the banks of the River Lyn in Devon, England. The river is formed as the Upper East Lyn at Malmsmead from two minor tributaries, the Oare Water and Badgworthy Water. It flows for several miles, past Brendon and makes confluence with Hoar Oak Water at Watersmeet, where Watersmeet House is situated. It then flows downstream for a further until the river meets with the West Lyn River and flows into the Bristol Channel at Lynmouth. The Lynmouth Disaster occurred on the East Lyn river  due to rocks and fallen trees having been washed into the WestLyn river. These formed a log jam near Watersmeet,. forming a landslide dam. When the pressure behind the dam increased to uncontrollable levels, the water broke out of the dam, and rushed down the EastLyn (via the convergence of the rivers) into Lynmouth, obliterating houses and ultimately resulting in 34 deaths. Boulders from the incident can still be seen today, lining the banks  of the Eastlyn as it travels to Lynmouth today. The River Lyn is popular for walkers with the Two Moors Way near to much of the river.Whitewater kayakers frequently run this river in the winter when seeking a challenging Grade 4 paddle. There is also trout fishing in the river, especially in the summer for salmon which migrate up the river to spawn. In an obituary of Mandela, The Times reported that the later chapters had been ""ghosted by a skilful US journalist"", and that Mandela had later started work on a second set of memoirs without a ghost writer. ""By the Sleepy Lagoon"" is a light orchestral valse serenade by British composer Eric Coates composed in 1930. In 1940, lyrics were added with Coates's approval by Jack Lawrence, and the resultant song became a popular music standard of the 1940s.

Dreyfus warned Lawrence that Coates ""may resent your tampering with his melody"" Coates thought the lyrics fitted so well that he could hardly believe it had been written to a pre-existing melody. After Lawrence showed the song to bandleader Harry James, it was recorded for a major hit. It first reached the Billboard Best Seller chart on 17 April 1942 and lasted 18 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 1. The song made the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960, in a version by the Platters, found originally on the flipside of the 1960 top ten ""Harbor Lights"" A Khmer language version was apparently recorded in the 1960s. In 2012, the musical piece became the main musical theme of the water fountain spectacle Aquanura at the Dutch theme park Efteling. The musical piece was partly rearranged and rerecorded by the Dutch Brabant Orchestra especially for the show. The phrase was in use by the mid-17th century, and may be a reference to the general sense of boundary, but is often understood to refer specifically to the English Pale in Ireland. In the nominally English territory of Ireland, only the Pale fell genuinely under the authority of English law, hence the terms within the pale and beyond the pale. The boundary of the Ashdown Forest (a royal hunting forest) was also known as the Pale, consisting of a paled fence and a ditch inside, to allow deer to jump in, but not back out. In addition, it calls into question the wisdom of their consignment beyond the Pale in Twentieth Century Britain, in addition to the Radical Right and Minorities in Britain, and in addition by their refusal to be British. The term ""beyond the pale"" is used to refer to areas outside the authority's jurisdiction, suggesting that anything outside the Authority's jurisdiction was uncivilized. It is also used as an idiom: beyond the extent or limits (of the thing named). The phrase may be used other than as a term of endearment, such as in the song ""By the Sleepy Lagoon"" by the band The Kinks, or in the film ""The Kinks"" by The Doors, which is based on the song. ""Block Buster!"" (also sometimes listed as ""Blockbuster!"") is a 1973 single by Sweet. Released in January 1973, it spent five weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart, and also made #1 in the Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Austria and Ireland. Outside Europe it fared less well as it peaked at #29 in Australia and at #73 on the American Billboard Hot 100. Its riff was considered markedly similar to fellow RCA act David Bowie's ""The Jean Genie"", released shortly before, but all parties maintain that this was pure coincidence. Some controversy rose after the band's performance of the song on the British television program Top of the Pops at December 25, 1973. In this performance, Sweet's bassist Steve Priest wore a Swastika. In 1984, the song was voted as the fourth most annoying song of all time in a Q poll for Q magazine. It went to become the eighth best-selling single of the 75th anniversary of the Q poll. The song was recorded by the band Black Lace in 1984 and recorded in ""Agadoo"" in 1984. It was released as a single by RCA Records in 1973, and was the group's sole UK No. 1 hit. It has since been remade in several versions, including a version with a different bassist and a different version of the lyrics. It is the only Sweet song to feature on the album ""Sweet"" (which was released the same year as the single ""Block Buster!""). It was also the first Sweet single to be released in the US, with a remastered version being released the following year. The single was also released in Australia, where it reached No. 29 on the US Hot 100 chart. It also appeared in the UK charts in 1973 and 1974, as well as the US charts in 1974 and 1975. The music video was directed by Mike Chapman and produced by Mike Wainman. The video was shot in the studio at the end of 1972 and the beginning of 1973. It features the song's lead singer, Nicky Chinn, and the songwriter, Mike Chapman, on a variety of instruments, including the bass, the guitar, the drums, the keyboards and the synthesizer. In the UK, the single was released in 1973 as a double A-side, with the B-side being released a month later. The B-Side was released a few weeks later, and it was the first time the single had been released in Europe outside of the Netherlands and Germany. The song's origins date back to 1971, when Michel Delancray and Mya Symille recorded it as ""Agadou"" in French. Club Med used it as their theme song from 1974. It was covered by several artists and groups, including Patrick Zabé in 1975 and the Saragossa Band (a German group) in 1981. One of the early versions of the song became popular in a Derby nightclub called Gossips, with the bar staff making a novelty dance. When Black Lace performed at the club in 1981, they learnt the dance and recorded their own version, which was the first version in English. The track was banned on BBC Radio 1 because it ""was not credible"", the track proved to be a commercial hit. It has found success in other countries as well, such as Ireland, New Zealand and France. In the Irish Singles Chart, the song peaked at number 5, but only spent 5 weeks in the charts overall. The song was parodied in a Vanilla Wheats commercial in 2006 and in a Mini Nards commercial in 2007. It is also used as the basis of a chant by fans of Liverpool band Agger. In November 2009, Chumbawamba recorded a version of "" Agadoo"" for the Peel Sessions. The producer of the Black LACE version was Neil Ferguson, who was also a full member of the band. In 2006, the track's track's composer Philip Pope had previously parodied the song as ""The Chicken Song"" by the satirical television programme Spitting Image. A version of the track was also used for a commercial for the defender Daniel Agger's football club, Liverpool Agger, in 2013, who recorded a bluegrass version of 'Agadoo' in May 2013. The version was produced by Neil Ferguson at his Woodlands studio under the direction of John Wagstaff and arranged by Barry Whitfield. In January 1985, its last appearance in the chart, ""Ag adoo"" had spent 35 weeks inThe song was revealed to be the eighth best-selling single of 1984 around that time. It re-entered the top 100 at number 64 on 16 August 1998, butonly stayed in thechart for a week. Fourteen years after its original release, thesong was remixed and re-released. In October 2007, the band Chumbwamba recorded an X-rated version, written by Black Laces members Alan Barton and Colin Gibb, and released on the B-side of the 12-inch vinyl ""Gang Bang"" Disney Animation’s “Zootopia” narrowly slipped by Laika’S stop-motion “Kubo and the Two Strings” to lead the 44th Annie Awards nominations. “Inside Out,” its heart-tugging journey through the mind of an 11-year-old girl, took home the top prize at the 43rd Annie Awards on Saturday night. Comedy duo Garfunkel & Oates’ “How to Train Your Dragon 2’ won the best animated film award at the 42nd annual Annie Awards honoring the best in film and TV/broadcast. The first U.S. made cruise missiles arrived today at an air base in England, the British Government announced. The shipment, delivered to Greenham Common air base by a United States plane, meant that an unspecified number of cruise missiles would be operational on schedule by the end of the year. The missiles are the first of NATO's new generation of medium- range missiles to be deployed in Western Europe. The British Government said tonight that the deployment would open a new round of protest and actions against the missiles' arrival in a speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet in London. The UK Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, discussed the arrival of the missiles’ arrival in her part of the speech at Lord's banquet. She said: ‘It is our destiny to be living at a time when there exist weapons of a dimension of war.’ The UK Government said today that the installation of the cruise weapons makes Britain today a more dangerous place than it was yesterday. The U.N. Security Council voted in favour of the deployment of cruise weapons in a vote held in Geneva today. The vote was held in favor of deploying the missiles in a meeting held in front of the UN Security Council. The decision was taken by the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who said the deployment was ‘a matter of national security’ and ‘should not be seen as a matter of political expediency’. The United States and the UK agreed that the missiles would not be deployed until after the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, where they will be deployed on a ‘timely’ basis. The missile deployment is expected to take place in the next few weeks. It is not known whether the missiles will be used in the Winter Olympics or the Summer Games in Sochi or the Winter Games in Vancouver, Canada. The arrival of the missiles at Greenham Common came two weeks after the House of Commons voted overwhelmingly to go ahead with deployment. The delivery of mobile launchers and other components of the cruise system began immediately. Next week, the West German Parliament is to hold its debate on the stationing of the American missiles. The cruise missile is essentially a small, pilotless aircraft that carries an explosive warhead, conventional or nuclear. It is called a cruise missile because it cruises like an airplane rather than being fired into a trajectory like a ballistic missile. It has a navigational system and is powered by a light turbofan engine rather than by the rockets that drive ballistic missiles, and has a range of 1,500 miles. The Russians have increased the number of SS-20's confronting Europe from 81 in 1979 to 252 today. The United States Air Force puts the current total at more than 260. All of the Pershing 2's will go to West Germany; the additional cruise missiles will be deployed not only in Britain and Italy but also in Belgium and the Netherlands. The Netherlands and Belguium are still contingent on final approval by the governments of those countries and will not take place until a year or more after most of the Missiles in Britain, Germany and Italy are operational. The first of 572 cruise and Pershing missiles that are to be deployed by 1988 are expected to be operational by Dec. 15. The missiles are scheduled to be ready for use by the end of the first quarter of 1988. They will be armed with a variety of warheads, including cruise, ballistic and sub-sonic missiles, as well as high-altitude cruise missiles, such as the Tomahawk cruise missile, which can carry a nuclear warhead. The U.S. government plans to have the missiles operational by the start of the second half of 1988, and the first of the third quarter of that year. The total number of cruise missiles in use by 1988 will be 572, with the majority of that number in West Germany, Britain, Italy and Belgium. The number of Pershings in use will be less than 100, with most of them being short-range. Anton Geesink was one of the few 10th Dan grade judoka (jūdan) recognized by the IJF but not by Kodokan at that rank. He was also a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) He was among the IOC members suspected of accepting bribes during the scandal surrounding the election of Salt Lake City as the host of the 2002 Winter Olympics. He won the first gold medal in the open class as the first non-Japanese judoka to win the gold medal at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. He worked for All Japan Pro Wrestling from 1973 to 1978, as a popular part-timer. His notable professional wrestling opponents included Bruno Sammartino, Gorilla Monsoon, Dick Murdoch, Dory Funk Jr., Bobby Duncum, Bob Remus (Sgt. Slaughter), Don Leo Jonathan, and Jumbo Tsuruta. In 1997, he was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the Japanese government. He lived in Utrecht, Netherlands, where he had a street named after him. He died in August 2010, at the age of 80. He is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son. He had a son and a daughter-in-law, both of whom are also judoka. He also has a son, who is a professional judo fighter and a father-of-two, who competes in the middleweight division. He has a daughter, who competed in the women's version of judo at the 2012 London Olympics. His son is a judo coach and has coached at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. His daughter is a former judo champion and now works as a coach in the U.S. She is married to a judoka, who also competed at the London Olympics in 1964. She won a gold medal for her country in women's judo in the judo open class at the 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2010 there are only three living 10th dan grade judokas recognized by Kodakan: Toshiro Daigo, Ichiro Abe and Yoshimi Osawa. In 2000, he received an honorary doctorate by Kokushikan University, a Japanese university known for its sport education and of which four alumni are Olympic gold medalists in judo, with the following praise:  “He has contributed to the international peace and promoted the spirit of budō, he has explored the light of somatology and has been devoted to judo education.”    “I am proud to say that I am the son of two judo champions.’’ nce involves two people beating, tapping, and sliding bamboo poles on the ground and against each other in coordination with one or more dancers. It is traditionally danced to rondalla music, a sort of serenade played by an ensemble of stringed instruments which originated in Spain during the Middle Ages. Tinikling is commonly performed on special occasions such as the Filipino Independence Day as a celebration of Filipino culture and Filipino pride. In the United States, this dance has been altered into a four-beat rhythm to adjust to popular music. In grades K-12 the dance is used as an aerobic exercise for physical education classes, to help expand physical movements such as hand coordination, foot speed, and also rhythm. For this traditional folk dance, females wear a dress called balintawak or patadyong, and males wear an untucked embroidered shirt called the barong tagalog. In some cases, it has been used in conjunction with traditional Filipino martial arts to demonstrate fleetness of foot and flow of movement. The dance originated in Leyte, an island in the Visayas in the central Philippines. It imitates the movement of the tikling birds as they walk between grass stems, run over tree branches, or dodge bamboo traps set by rice farmers. The bamboo has to be closed hard enough to make a sound, and the dancers must be quick enough to not get their foot (or feet) caught. As the dance continues, the banging of the bamboo becomes faster and harder, the sound of the clashing bamboo and the quickness of feet demonstrated by the dancers thrilling the crowd. The name ""tinikling"" is a reference to birds locally known as tikled, which can be any of a number of rail species; the term tinikiling literally means ""tikling-like"" and is used to refer to the dance in the Philippines. For more information, visit tinikling.org or go to the official website of the Filipino Dance Association (Filipino Dance Association) or the official YouTube channel of the Filipino dance association (Philippine Dance Association). For more details on the dance, go to www.filipinodance.org. ""Yummy Yummy Yummies"" is a bubblegum pop song by Arthur Resnick and Joey Levine, first recorded by Ohio Express in 1968. Their version reached No. 4 on the U.S. Pop Singles chart and No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart. In Time Magazine's 2011 list of top 10 songs with silly lyrics it ranked No. 8. The song has been used in a commercial for Kinder chocolate, in The Simpsons in the episode ""Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie"", and in Monty Python's Flying Circus. It also makes an appearance in the movie Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. The Tinikling, a dance using bamboo poles, is the (or a) main national dance of which 7,000-island nation? The answer is: Islas Filipinas (or the State of Ohio) The song is a fictional character from Charles Dickens's 1850 novel, David Copperfield. He was modelled on Dickens' father, John Dickens, who like Micawber was incarcerated in debtors' prison (the King's Bench Prison) after failing to meet his creditors' demands. He is known for asserting his faith that ""something will turn up"". His name has become synonymous with someone who lives in hopeful expectation, and with the expectation that his income, annual expenditure and annual income will result in happiness, and he is a monocle, a top hat, and a top-breeches, a hat-bches, top hat and top hat. He also has a wife, Emma, who stands by him despite his financial exigencies that force her to pawn all of her family's heirlooms. She lives by the maxims, ""I will never desert Mr. Micawsber!"" and ""Experientia does it!"" (from Experientia docet, ""One learns by experience."") The song also appears in Daniel Peggotty's Em'ly and Little Em'ty, where Micawbs becomes the manager of the Port Middlebay Bank and a successful government magistrate for the first time in the first edition of the book, Habotty and the Little Em’ly. It has since been covered by many artists, including Giorgio Moroder, Julie London, Baccara, and The Rolling Stones. It is also featured in Dave Barry's Book of Bad Songs, and in Futurama's ""Last McSupper"" scene of the film Super Size Me. It was also used in the TV show ""How Not to Be Seen"" (facetiously credited to ""Jackie Charlton and the Toenails"") The character was played by W.C. Fields in the 1935 screen classic, Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger. Bob Hoskins took the role in a 1999 BBC serial. Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones named one of his guitars ""Micawber"" The character formed the basis of Micawber, a 2001 ITV drama series written by John Sullivan and starring David Jason in the title leading role. Judge David Halpern described Craig Whyte's legal arguments in a case heard in 2013 as ""pure MicawBERism"" The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a Micawbser as ""one who is poor but lives in optimistic expectation of better fortune"". The character has given rise to a number of memorable quotations, including: ""Welcome poverty!..Welcome misery, welcome houselessness, welcome hunger, rags, tempest, and beggary! Mutual confidence will sustain us to the end!"" and ""I ask no more. Let it be, in justice, merely said of me, as of a gallant and eminent Naval Hero, with whom I have no pretensions to cope, that what I have done, I did, in despite of mercenary and selfish objectives, ""FOR ENGLAND, HOME AND BEAUTY."" Remaining always, &c, & c, Wilkins Micawbers. ""Never despair! -Never despair!"" ""I have no doubt I shall, please Heaven, begin to be more beforehand with the world, and to live in a perfectly new manner, if -if, in short, anything turns up"" ""I shall depart this metropolis without paying a valedictory visit to my dear friend Copperfield, in whose debt I shall speak metaphorically of!"" ""When the stomach is empty, the spirits are low!"" ""Remember my motto ""Nil Desperandum!"" - never despair!""""I will never forget you, my friend, and I will not forget you."" ""I will always remember you, and you will always be with me."" ""Never forget me, and never forget me!"" ""Never, ever forget you!"" ""You are my friend and I am your friend."" ""You have never forgotten me, nor will I forget you"" ""You will never be forgotten, and neither will I."" ""What was the first name of Dickens''? ""Mr. Micawsber""? ""The Who's Who"" ""The Dickensian"" ""Who's Who?"" ""Who the Dickensian?"" ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" is an English language nursery rhyme of nineteenth-century American origin. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 7622. The rhyme is also famous for being the first thing recorded by Thomas Edison on his newly invented phonograph in 1877. Buddy Guy and Stevie Ray Vaughan both popularized the song in their own albums: Guy composing his own bluesy version of the song for his album A Man and the Blues in 1968 and Vaughan covering Guy's version in his 1983 debut album, Texas Flood. In 1972, Paul McCartney released a version. Just as he had done with the 16th-century poem Golden Slumbers which was released on The Beatles' Abbey Road LP in 1969, he added his own melody to the lyrics. This British version is the slightly different from the American version:According to the nursery. rhyme, whose lamb followed, Mary had a little lamb. It is commercially available on the 1993 CD issue of the Wings Wild Life LP. The earliest recording (1878) was retrieved by 3-D imaging equipment in 2012. It was the first instance of recorded verse. In 1927, Edison reenacted the recording, which still survives. The song was a top 20 hit in Britain but both the choice for and the saccharine arrangement of ""Mary had a Little lamb"" did much to erode his standing with leading rock journalists. It's a number of common names, including baby's tears, baby's mind, angel's tears and pe-own-your-business, pele's mind. It also has a name for a plant in the nettle family: Helirolia (Soleiroli) which is a solei (solei) in the family of Heliaceae. The word ""lamb"" is used to refer to a pet lamb that Mary Tyler kept as a young girl. The poem was written by Sarah Josepha Hale on May 24, 1830, and was inspired by an actual incident. There are two competing theories on the origin of this poem. One holds that Roulstone wrote the first four lines and that the final twelve lines, less childlike than the first, were composed by SarahJosepha Hale; the other is that Hale was responsible for the entire poem. The original poem was published by the Boston publishing firm Marsh, Capen & Lyon, as an original poem. The 1998 Winter Olympics, officially the, was a winter multi-sport event celebrated from 7 to 22 February 1998 in Nagano, Japan. They were the third Olympic Games and second winter Olympics to be held in Japan, after the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo. The Games saw the introduction of women's ice hockey, curling and snowboarding. The host city selection was held in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 15 June 1991, at the 97th IOC session. Nagano prevailed over Salt Lake City by just 4 votes. In June 1995, Salt Lake was chosen as the host of the following 2002 Winter Olympics. The games were succeeded by the 1998 Winter Paralympics from 5 to 14 March. These were the final Winter Olympic Games under the IOC Presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch. It is not a moss, nor should it be confused with Sagina subulata or Chondrus crispus (an alga), which are also known as ""Irish moss"". It is a delicate-looking creeping herb with juicy bright green or yellow leaves and multitudes of tiny white flowers. It grows close to the ground in mats and is sometimes used in ornamental gardens alongside ferns and other moisture-loving types of plant. In colder regions the plant dies back during winter, but it returns with lush growth as the temperature increases. To eradicate it once it has become established in an area, the entire plant must be removed, or else it can sprout new growth. It can be grown indoors as a houseplant and used in habitats for amphibians. It prefers shade and moderate moisture. The leaves are usually slightly stalked, about 5 mm across, and the minute flowers produce oval seeds. Nurseries grow several varieties, including gold, yellow, and white breeds, but the mossy-green type is most popular with gardeners. It was named after Joseph-François Soleirol by Esprit Requien, an amateur botanist, originally collected the plant in Corsica. It has a number of common names, including baby's tears, angel's tears and mind-your-own-business, pollyanna vine, the Corsican curse, and mother of thousands. The 1998 Winter Olympic mascots are the four snowy owls. They represent respectively fire (Sukki), air (Nokki), earth (Lekki) and water (Tsukki), and together they represent the four islands of Japan. 72 nations participated in the 1998 Winter Olympic Games. Curling returned as an official sport, after having been demoted to a demonstration event after the inaugural Winter Games in Chamonix in 1924. Women's ice hockey was contested at the Olympic Games for the first time ever, and the United States beat the Canadians 3–1 for the gold medal. Denmark won their first winter Olympic medal (and only one to date) when they won a silver medal in the women's curling event. There were 68 events contested in 7 sports (14 disciplines) and 68 nations took part in the Games. The 100m final has been the greatest event at every Olympic Games, generating the greatest hype and generating the most excitement. Jesse Owens was the first athlete to run under ten seconds in an Olympic final in 1968, while Usain Bolt ruled the gold in 2008. The men’s 100m has been run in 10 seconds or less, but it carries a lot of history and tradition, with Jim Hines, Bob Costello, and others all having done it. The women's 100m is the only event that has been done and dusted in less than 10 seconds, and it was run in the closing ceremony of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. It is the first Winter Olympic event to be held in a country that is not a member of the European Union (EU) or the United Nations (UN). It is also the only Winter Olympics to have been held in Japan, with the exception of the 1992 Winter Games, which was held in Oslo, Norway. It was the last Winter Olympics held in Germany, where it was held from 1988 to 1992. The Games were held in Nagano, Japan, and Shizuoka, Japan. They were the first Olympics to be hosted by a nation that did not have a Winter Games team. The games were held on the island of Honshu, in the north of Japan, which is home to the majority of the country's Olympic athletes. They also hosted the Winter Paralympic Games in 1992, which were also held in Shizuoku, Japan and in 1998. The Winter Games began on February 8, 1998, and ended on February 18, 1998. They took place in venues across the country, including in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagasaki, Nagano and Shikoku, and in the cities of Nagasaki and Shiga, with a total of 72 nations taking part. There are 68 nations in the Winter Olympics Games, with 68 nations competing in all 14 disciplines. The current world record of 9.58 seconds, held by Usain Bolt, will be bettered in London. Enjoy these video clips of every Olympic 100m final from Berlin in 1936 to the last Olympics in Beijing. The uncatchable Bolt smashes the world and Olympic records and is so far ahead with 30 metres to go, he cruises over the finish line before celebrating in trademark fashion. Justin Gatlin runs a great race but is almost caught on the line by Portugal’s Francis Obikwelu and his compatriot Maurice Greene. Lindy Remigino appears to lunge forward over the line, thinking he had won. But Jamaica’S Herb McKenley was right behind him and almost took six seconds to decide. All runners were separated by just a tenth of a second. Jesse Owens looks unimpressed as we see the great winning his four gold medals in Berlin. Who became the oldest Olympics 100m champion? Ask me.

Swarkestone
Swarkestone is a village and civil parish in Derbyshire, England. The population at the 2011 Census was 187. 

Swarkestone has a very old village church, a full cricket pitch, a plant nursery/ garden centre and restaurant called ""Swarkestone Nursery"", the Crewe and Harpur pub, a canal with locks and moorings. It was mentioned twice in Domesday as Sorchestun or Suerchestune, when it was worth twenty shillings.Domesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003. ISBN 0-14-143994-7 p.742 & 749

Swarkstone Bridge

The ancient bridge at Swarkestone crosses the River Trent about 6 miles south of Derby and was for about 300 years the Midlands' main crossing of the Trent. The only crossing between Burton Upon Trent and Nottingham, it is currently Grade I Listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

History

Swarkestone bridge was built in the 13th century to cross the river and its surrounding marshes, between the villages of Swarkstone and Stanton by Bridge.[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid
1088337 Swarkestone Bridge and Causeway], English Heritage, retrieved 7 September 2014 It was financed by the two Bellamont sisters. Both had become engaged and were to throw a joint celebration; their fiances, however, had to meet the local barons on the far side of the river. Following a storm the Trent became swollen; eager to return to their brides-to-be and their party, the men tried to ford the river on horseback: both were swept away and drowned. The Bellamont sisters commissioned the bridge so that no one else would suffer the tragedy they had. Neither sister married and both died in poverty having exhausted their fortune on building the bridge.

Swarkstone bridge is three quarters of a mile long and has 17 arches. It is the longest stone bridge in England, and the longest inland bridge in England.

In 1745, Swarkstone Bridge was the furthest point South Bonny Prince Charlie, and his troops, got in his attempt to reclaim the British Throne.

According to Pevsner, the present part actually crossing the river, which has 5 arches, dates from the 18th century and was designed by Thomas Harrison.  Substantial work was carried out in 1795–1797 by Thomas Sykes, County Surveyor of Bridges for Derbyshire, at a cost of  £3,550.

The Bridge Today

The bridge is undersized for modern traffic and is scarcely two-lane for cars at several points. Though there is a weight limit of 7.5 tonnes, the walls of the bridge often take damage from traffic.

Local Legends

The bridge is subject to several local legends. It is supposed to be haunted by the ghosts of the two Bellamont Sisters that constructed the bridge. Others have alleged the bridge is haunted by Bonny Prince Charlie's troops.
 The most commonly reported phenomenon is the sound of horses approaching at speed when there is nothing about.

The bridge is also subject to a local legend which says that the river must claim 3 lives every year in order for it to be 'pacified'. The bridge is a local accident black-spot, with 15 reported road-traffic accidents between 2008 and 2010.[http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Fatal-crash-car-road-says-expert/story-11566348-detail/story.html#axzz2On4yqTMl A CAR that caused a fatal crash on Swarkestone Bridge should not have been on the road, according to a police vehicle examiner. | This is Derbyshire]

History

Evidence of the Beaker people living near Swarkestone was discovered in the 1950s. At that time it was estimated that people had lived near Swarkestone for at least 3,800 years.  The only surviving Bronze Age barrow cemetery in the Trent valley is at Swarkestone Lows near the A50. The barrow is a registered national monument. 

In the Domesday Book, Swarkestone was held by the King (William the conqueror) and by Henry de Ferrers.

In the Battle of Swarkestone Bridge during the English Civil War (1643) it was defended by the Royalists against the Parliamentarians, but the outnumbered Cavaliers lost the day.

In 1745 during the Jacobite Rebellion led by Bonnie Prince Charlie, the advance party of his army reached here to gain control of the crossing of the Trent. Finding no reports of support from the south, they turned back to Derby; the invading army then retreated to Scotland and final defeat at the Battle of Culloden. Swarkestone thereby being the most southerly point reached during that army's advance on London.

Sport

Swarkestone cricket club has gained quite a reputation in recent years. After gaining promotion to the Derbyshire Premier Cricket League in 2011, they finished 2nd in the subsequent year and won the Premier League in the 2013 season, thus becoming the top league team in Derbyshire.

The Pavilion

Nearby is the Jacobean grandstand called Swarkestone Hall Pavilion and walled area, formerly connected with Harpur Hall, where (it is believed, see Pevsner, loc. cit.), they used to bait bulls. The pavilion is attributed to John Smythson who also designed Bolsover Castle, and is Grade I Listed.  It was repaired and is now owned by the Landmark Trust who maintain it and rent it out to holidaymakers.

Answer:
","Passage:
Gentleman thief
A gentleman thief, lady thief, or  in the East, is a recurring stock character. A gentleman or lady thief usually has inherited wealth and is characterised by impeccable manners, charm, courteousness and the avoidance of physical force or intimidation to steal. As such, they do not steal to gain material wealth but for the thrill of the act itself, often combined in fiction with correcting a moral wrong, selecting wealthy targets, or stealing only particular rare and challenging objects.

In popular culture

In fictional works, the phantom thief is typically superb at stealing while maintaining a gentleman's manners and code of honour; for example, Robin Hood is a former Earl who steals from the rich to give to the poor, Raffles only steals from other gentlemen (and occasionally gives the object away to a good cause); Lupin steals from the rich who do not appreciate their art or treasures and redistributes it; Saint Tail steals back what was stolen or taken dishonestly, or rights the wrongs done to the innocent by implicating 'the real' criminals. Sly Cooper and his gang steals from other thieves and criminals.

by Richard Jauron, Department of Horticulture
A native of Mexico, marigolds have been grown in gardens throughout the world for hundreds of years.  Today, they are one of the most popular bedding plants in the United States.  Marigolds are easy to grow, bloom reliably all summer, and have few insect and disease problems.  The marigold's only shortcoming (for some people) is its pungent aroma.
There are numerous marigold varieties available to home gardeners.  Many of the commonly grown marigolds are varieties of African and French marigolds. Less known are the triploid hybrids and the signet marigolds. The African marigolds (Tagetes erecta) have large, double,  yellow-to-orange flowers from midsummer to frost.  Flowers may measure up to 5 inches across. Plant height varies from 10 to 36 inches.  African marigolds are excellent bedding plants.  Tall varieties can be used as  background plantings.  Suggested African marigolds for Iowa include varieties in the Inca and Perfection series. (A series is a group of closely related varieties with uniform characteristics, such as height,  spread, and flowering habit.  The only characteristic that varies within a series is flower color.)  African marigolds are also referred to as American marigolds.
The French marigolds (Tagetes patula) are smaller, bushier plants with flowers up to 2 inches across.  Flower colors are yellow, orange, and mahogany-red.  Many varieties have bicolored flowers.  Flower heads may be single or double.  Plant height ranges from 6 to 18 inches.  The French marigolds have a longer blooming season than the African marigolds.  They generally bloom from spring until frost.  The French marigolds also hold up better in rainy weather.  French marigolds are ideal for edging flower beds and in mass plantings.  They also do well in containers and window boxes.  Queen Sophia and Golden Gate are excellent French marigold varieties.  Varieties in the Boy, Early Spice, Hero, Janie, and Safari series also perform well in Iowa.
The triploid hybrids are crosses between the tall, vigorous African marigolds and the compact, free-flowering French marigolds.  Triploid hybrid marigolds are unable to set seed.  As a result, plants bloom repeatedly through the summer, even in hot weather.  One problem with the triploids is their low seed germination rate.  Average germination is around 50 percent.  Since the triploid hybrids are unable to produce viable seed, they also know as mule marigolds.
Signet marigolds (Tagetes tenuifolia) are quite different from most marigolds. Signet marigold plants are bushy with fine, lacy foliage.  The small, single flowers literally cover the plants in summer.  Flower colors range from yellow to orange.  They are also edible.  The flowers of signet marigolds have a spicy tarragon flavor.  The foliage has a pleasant lemon fragrance.  Signet marigolds are excellent plants for edging beds and in window boxes.  The varieties Golden Gem and Lemon Gem do well in Iowa.
There are basically three planting options available to home gardeners when planting marigolds.  Marigold seed can be sown directly outdoors when the danger of frost is past or started indoors 6 weeks prior to the last frost date.  Marigolds are also available as bedding plants at garden centers.
Planting site requirements for marigolds are full sun and a well-drained soil.  Plant spacing varies from 6 to 9 inches for the French marigolds and up to 18 inches for the taller African marigold varieties.
Summer care of marigolds is simple.  Water occasionally during dry weather and pinch off faded flowers to encourage additional bloom.  Tall African marigolds may require staking to prevent the plants from falling over or lodging during storms.
While marigolds are seldom bothered by insects and diseases, they are not problem free.  Spider mites can devastate marigolds in hot, dry weather. Grasshoppers can also cause considerable damage.  Aster yellows is an occasionally disease problem.  In a related matter, some gardeners plant marigolds in their vegetable gardens to repel harmful insects.  While the marigolds are an attractive addition to the garden, research studies have concluded they aren't effective in reducing insect damage on vegetable crops.

Liz Doogan-Hobbs MBE Takes Home Top Prize At National Business Award
December 6, 2012
Liz Doogan-Hobbs’
Liz Doogan-Hobbs’ story is the stuff of legend. Suffering a near fatal accident as a world champion sportswoman, she pursued a career in broadcasting before launching the phenomenally successful Liz Hobbs Group Ltd events company, credited with galvanising the dwindling British live music and horse-racing industries. Today, the 52 year old, from Newark has been named as winner of the 2012 NatWest everywoman Award, honouring the most passionate and dedicated woman business owner who has overcome significant challenges to achieve success.
The qualities that helped Liz Doogan-Hobbs become a World Champion have undoubtedly aided her meteoric business success.  It takes a certain type of person with raw grit and determination to suffer a near fatal accident and come back to successfully defend a world title, but Liz did just this when she became the World Water Ski Race Champion for the second time in 1983.
After retiring from competitive sport, Liz worked in media and entertainment before moving into artist management for sports, theatre and television personalities. Fusing her passions for sport and music she identified an opportunity to provide music concerts after sporting events.  This had two major benefits as a business model – with attendance at sporting events, horse racing in particular, in decline the introduction of live music opened the sport up to a new audience.  Furthermore the music industry was feeling the squeeze with the rise of internet downloads yet live performances continued to provide a significant income for artists.
Despite early scepticism the racing and music industries embraced the idea, which has since taken off.  Liz Hobbs Group now provides the largest revenue stream to the racing industry and has since expanded into other sports. Listed as one of the Sunday Times Fast Track 100 companies, Liz Hobbs Group turns over £7m annually and has worked with some of the world’s biggest artists including Tom Jones, Rod Stewart and Razorlight. Outside of work she has supported numerous charities and this year aims to raise £1 million for Breast Cancer Research.
The NatWest everywoman Awards are celebrating 10 years of showcasing the diversity and phenomenal success of women business owners across the UK. In the past decade, these awards have raised the profile of hundreds of women of all ages, across every imaginable sector, demonstrating the impact of female owned enterprises, which contribute a staggering £130 billion to the UK economy each year*.  The extraordinary achievements of previous winners and finalists have played a huge role in encouraging other women to start and grow a business.
Winner Liz Doogan-Hobbs MBE commented: “I would like to say thank you to NatWest Everywoman Awards, the sponsor of this award, my NatWest rock Andy Procter, and of course my family, who I’m thrilled are here. Coming here today and being among such inspirational businesswomen, I never imagined I would be crowned as the winner of the NatWest everywoman Award.  Everybody as individuals have the opportunity to realise their potential, they just have to want it!”
Commenting on this year’s winners, everywoman co-founder, Karen Gill MBE, says, “Over the past ten years we have uncovered incredible stories of professional triumphs, so many of which have been in the face of incredible adversity.  This year more than ever the judges were humbled by the extraordinary tenacity and determination shown by the finalists.  Drive to succeed takes on new meaning with these women and the word ‘inspiring’ doesn’t do justice to their achievements. We know that there are thousands of women around the UK with a business idea and we are here to support them as their concept turns into reality.  Today’s winners are testimony that with hard work and persistence – dreams of enterprise can come true.”
Andy Procter, Senior Relationship Manager, NatWest commented: “We are so proud of everything that Liz has achieved with the Liz Hobbs Group and there could not be a more worthy winner of the NatWest everywoman Award. The challenges that Liz has had to overcome to make her business the success that it is today have been significant and I have been privileged to work with Liz through some of these. I look forward to continuing to support Liz and her business, and to witnessing many more award successes!”
The awards were hosted by Olivia Sterns, of Bloomberg Television at the Dorchester and attended by a host of high profile women entrepreneurs including Cath Kidston MBE; Chrissie Rucker MBE, founder of The White Company; Anna Lee, co-founder of Storm Watches, and Eve Lom.

A+E Networks
On this day, writer Fyodor Dostoevsky is led before a firing squad and prepared for execution. He had been convicted and sentenced to death on November 16 for allegedly taking part in antigovernment activities. However, at the last moment he was reprieved and sent into exile.
Dostoevsky’s father was a doctor at Moscow’s Hospital for the Poor, where he grew rich enough to by land and serfs. After his father’s death, Dostoevsky, who suffered from epilepsy, studied military engineering and became a civil servant while secretly writing novels. His first, Poor People, and his second, The Double, were both published in 1846–the first was a hit, the second a failure.
On December 22, 1849, Dostoevsky was led before the firing squad but received a last-minute reprieve and was sent to a Siberian labor camp, where he worked for four years. He was released in 1854 and worked as a soldier on the Mongolian frontier. He married a widow and finally returned to Russia in 1859. The following year, he founded a magazine, and two years after that he journeyed to Europe for the first time.
In 1864 and 1865, his wife and his brother died, the magazine folded, and Dostoevsky found himself deeply in debt, which he exacerbated by gambling.
In 1866, he published Crime and Punishment, one of his most popular works. In 1867, he married a stenographer, and the couple fled to Europe to escape his creditors. His novel The Possessed (1872) was successful, and the couple returned to St. Petersburg. He published The Brothers Karamazov in 1880 to immediate success, but died a year later.

Question:
Which Russian author was reprieved from execution at the last minute?
Answer:
Fiodor Dostoevsky
","['Trent', 'Trent (disambiguation)', 'TRENT']",3876,triviaqa,en,,61dd0325b82ea97a7b6700acf7f12662ddfaa88d785c9a31," A gentleman thief, lady thief, or  in the East, is a recurring stock character. A gentleman or lady thief usually has inherited wealth and is characterised by impeccable manners, charm, courteousness and the avoidance of physical force or intimidation to steal. They do not steal to gain material wealth but for the thrill of the act itself, often combined in fiction with correcting a moral wrong, selecting wealthy targets, or stealing only particular rare and challenging objects. In fictional works, the phantom thief is typically superb at stealing while maintaining a gentleman's manners and code of honour. Western gentlemen/lady thieves include: Simon Templar, also known as ""The Saint"" from the novel series by Leslie Charteris, and Selina Kyle from the Batman series. Eastern phantom thieves include the following: Arsène Lupin and elements in other crime fictions and detective fictions. The term is also used in Eastern media such as anime and manga, and draws inspiration from Arsèn Lupin, the grandson of the author of Hidan Aria, and the granddaughter of Arsèe Lupin. In Japanese, the term is ""Shinshi"" (gentleman in Japanese) and refers to a character who can transform into Kamen Rider from 2009's Kamenden Rider Decade Series Kamen Riders. The character's name approximately translates to ""phantom thief,"" and she is the archrival of Hajime Kindaichi in the case Files of Detective Conan by Gosho Aoyama. For more information on this article, visit the website of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Literature and the Japan Institute for the Study of the Arts (JSAI) or visit the JSAI's website at: http://www.jsui.org.jp/jsai/jesai/JSAi/index.html. The article was originally published in the online version of this article as ""Gentleman thief: A Glossary of Terms for Gentleman Thieves and Lady Thieves"". It has been updated to include the term ""Phantom Thief"" for the sake of completeness and to make clear that JSAi is a term for the gentleman thief and not a lady thief. We are happy to clarify that this article has been amended to reflect that the term phantom thief does not refer to the lady thief in the Japanese version of the Kaidan Rider series. We apologise for any confusion caused by this. Marigolds have been grown in gardens throughout the world for hundreds of years. Marigolds are easy to grow, bloom reliably all summer, and have few insect and disease problems. They are one of the most popular bedding plants in the United States. They have a longer blooming season than the French marigolds. They hold up to 18 inches in the French spring bloom. They also do well in rainy weather. They can be used as edging in mass plantings and as background plantings. There are numerous marigold varieties available to home gardeners. Many varieties have single or double bored flowers or double-bored flowers. The only characteristic that varies within a series is flower color. There is no way of knowing which of the characters are based on real-life people. The author has never met any of the actors who appear in the series. He has only seen the first two episodes of the first season of the anime adaptation of the manga Fullmetal Alchemist. He also has never seen the second episode of the series, but he has seen the third and the fourth. He is not allowed to watch the third or the fourth episodes until the final episode is released. He will not be able to see the fifth or the sixth episodes until after the release of the second season. He cannot see the seventh and the seventh episodes. He can only see the eighth and the ninth episodes after they are released. The final episode will be released after the 10th anniversary of the third season of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood of the Sun"" on November 14. The series is based on the book ""Mysterious Joker"" by Jack O'Brien, who is also known as ""Jack Joker"" and ""Clara"" in the anime. The book is published by Simon & Schuster and is available on DVD and Blu-ray in the U.S. and on Blu-Ray in the UK. It is also available in Europe and Australia. It will be available in North America and Australia on November 15 and 19, 2014. It has not yet been released in Australia and the UK on November 19 and 20, 2014, but it is expected to be released in Europe by the end of the year. The first episode is entitled ""The Phantom Thief"" and is the first of a two-part series.

FIFA Ballon d'Or
The FIFA Ballon d'Or (, ""Golden Ball"") is an annual association football award given to the world's best male player by the sport's governing body, FIFA, and the French publication France Football since 2010. It is awarded based on votes from international media representatives and national team coaches and captains, who select the player they deem to have performed the best in the previous calendar year. A fusion between the former Ballon d'Or and the men's FIFA World Player of the Year award, the FIFA Ballon d'Or is considered the most prestigious individual award in world football. 

Since its inception, the FIFA Ballon d'Or has been dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of their ongoing rivalry. Barcelona's Messi won the inaugural Ballon d'Or, before reclaiming the title the following two years and again in 2015. Ronaldo, who plays for Real Madrid, won two successive awards in the intervening years.

Background

Prior to 2010, the leading individual awards in association football were the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award.   The original Ballon d'Or, also known as the European Footballer of the Year award, had been awarded by the French publication France Football since 1956. European sports journalists invited by France Football selected the recipients from among European or Europe-based players. The FIFA World Player of the Year award, presented by the governing body FIFA from 1991, was international in scope. Winners were chosen by the national team coaches and captains under FIFA's jurisdiction. 
  
From 2005, the winners of the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award were identical each year. Following the introduction of a global Ballon d'Or format in 2007, France Football and FIFA opted to merge the two awards. The creation of the FIFA Ballon d'Or was subsequently announced during the FIFA World Cup held in South Africa in 2010. The inaugural award was presented that same year to the Argentine Lionel Messi.  For historical purposes, both organisations regard the FIFA Ballon d'Or as a continuation of their respective former awards.   The FIFA World Player of the Year award continues as a women's-only award. 

The winner of the FIFA Ballon d'Or is chosen by international media representatives and national team coaches and captains. In a voting system based on positional voting, each voter is allotted three votes, worth five points, three points and one point, and the three finalists are ordered based on total number of points. Voters are provided with a shortlist from which they can select the three players they deem to have performed the best in the previous calendar year.

Limburger
Limburger is a cheese that originated during the 19th century in the historical Duchy of Limburg, which is now divided among modern-day Belgium, Germany, and Netherlands. The cheese is especially known for its pungent odor caused by the bacteria Brevibacterium linens, which smells like strong body odor and particularly smelly feet. 

Manufacture

While today most Limburger is produced in Germany, Herve cheese is a type of Limburger which is still produced in the territory of the old Duchy of Limburg. Herve is located near Liège, and the borders separating Belgium from the Netherlands and Germany. The ""Pays de Herve"" is a hilly area between the Vesdre and Meuse rivers.

In the US, it was first produced in 1867 by Rudolph Benkerts in his cellar from pasteurized goat's milk.  A few years later, 25 factories produced this cheese. The Chalet Cheese Cooperative in Monroe, Wisconsin is the only American company that makes this cheese. It is also manufactured in Canada, where it is a German-Canadian cultural marker, by the Oak Grove Cheese Company in New Hamburg, Ontario.

Description

In its first month, the cheese is firmer and more crumbly, similar to the texture of feta cheese. After about six weeks, the cheese becomes softer along the edges but is still firm on the inside and can be described as salty and chalky. After two months of its life, it is mostly creamy and much smoother. Once it reaches three months, the cheese produces its notorious smell because of the bacterium used to ferment Limburger cheese and many other smear-ripened cheeses.   This is Brevibacterium linens, the same one found on human skin that is partially responsible for body odor and particularly foot odor.

Uses

One of the most traditional forms of eating limburger is the limburger sandwich. After three months, when the cheese has ripened, it becomes spreadable. The cheese is often spread thick (> 0.5 cm) on firm-textured 100% rye bread, with a large, thick slice of onion, and is typically served with strong black coffee or lager beer. Alternatively, for heartier eaters, chunks or slices of the cheese up to 1.5 cm thick can be cut off the block and placed in the sandwich. This sandwich still remains very popular among the descendants of German immigrants residing in the midwest part of America, such as in Cincinnati, or German Village in Columbus, Ohio. However, it is markedly less popular among the descendants born after ca. 1960, mainly because of the permeating smell, and the inconvenience of going to specialty cheese and sausage shops to obtain it. In Wisconsin, the Limburger sandwich can be found on menus at certain restaurants, accompanied by brown mustard. 

Limburger and its characteristic odor are a frequent butt of jokes and gags. Reactions to, and misinterpretations of, the smell of limburger cheese were gags used in numerous Little Rascals and Three Stooges comedy shorts.  Also, the arch-enemy of the Biker Mice from Mars has the name Lawrence Limburger, complete with terrible body odor.

In 2006, a study showing that the malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) is attracted equally to the smell of Limburger and to the smell of human feet earned the Ig Nobel Prize in the area of biology.   The results of the study were published in the medical journal The Lancet on 9 November 1996.

Nutrition facts

28 grams of Limburger contains 5 grams of saturated fat and 8 grams of total fat. 67 of the 92 calories in the 28 grams are from fat.

From which country does 'Limburger' cheese come?

Black Sheep Brewery
The Black Sheep Brewery is a brewery in Masham in the Borough of Harrogate in North Yorkshire, England.

History

The Black Sheep Brewery was established by Paul Theakston in 1991. Following a successful launch as a Business Expansion Scheme, it became a public limited company (plc) in 1992. Paul Theakston had been managing director of Theakstons brewery, also in Masham, since 1968. He began at the age of 23, taking over from his father, Frank Theakston.

Theakstons brewery was bought by Matthew Brown following disagreements between members of the family and other shareholders, and in 1987 Matthew Brown was in turn taken over by Scottish and Newcastle. Paul Theakston left in 1988, and after a hiatus of more than a year purchased the North Yorkshire Malt Roasting Company, originally part of the former Lightfoot's brewery site, from an animal feed company, in order to start a new brewery in Masham.

Theakston wanted to use the Lightfoot name to bring back an old brewing tradition; however it was discovered that this name had already been trademarked by Scottish and Newcastle. The associations of Masham with sheep led Theakston to come up with the name ""Sheep Brewery"" which rapidly became ""Black Sheep"" at his wife's suggestion.The first and original Black Sheep Best Bitter was sold at the Bruce Arms by its Landlord, David Young.

The brewery produces a range of well-hopped bitters, to distinguish itself from Theakston's range of fruity and yeasty beers. The brewery quickly became successful after formation, and now produces over 75,000 barrels a year. The brewery has capitalised on its popularity by converting unused parts of the original maltings into a visitors centre to promote visits to the brewery itself.

The brewery re-launched their Emmerdale Ale as a lower-alcohol beer (formerly 5%) on 27 January 2006 at The Crown in Manfield for the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA). The launch party saw Chris Chittell (Eric Pollard from the Emmerdale TV series) pull the first pint of the new brew. Emmerdale Ale is no longer brewed. The night also marked the rebranding of Black Sheep's Special Ale (in cask form) as Black Sheep Ale, the name that it has been sold as in bottles since 1992, bringing both into line. 

In 2008, the brewery launched Draught Golden Sheep, a blonde cask beer with a refreshing citrus-hop flavour. It remains a seasonal brew. This, like all Black Sheep beers and indeed the brewing plant itself was created by Paul Ambler, Head Brewer since 1992 and later Operations Director. Paul Ambler has now retired. Comments Paul Theakston, ""Over the years, Paul Ambler has been a fierce champion of the quality of our beer, which is the keystone of our success"".

All bottled beers brewed by the Black Sheep Brewery are suitable for both vegetarians and vegans.

According to the website, ""...Riggwelter takes its name from the local Yorkshire Dales dialect – when a sheep is on its back and can’t get up without help, local dialect says it is riggwelted.  This dialect word comes from the old Viking words: ‘rigg’(rygg) meaning back and ‘velte’ to overturn (the words and their meaning are still largely the same in the modern North Germanic languages).   Riggwelter is also popular in Sweden, being in the top 20 of bottled ales sold in that country.

It is awarded based on votes from international media representatives and national team coaches and captains, who select the player they deem to have performed the best in the previous calendar year. Lionel Messi won the inaugural award in 2009, before reclaiming the title the following two years and again in 2015. Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays for Real Madrid, won two successive awards in the intervening years. The FIFA World Player of the Year award continues as a women's-only award. For historical purposes, both organisations regard the FIFA Ballon D'Or as a continuation of their respective former awards. The inaugural award was presented that same year to the Argentine Lionel Messi. In a voting system based on positional voting, each voter is allotted three votes, worth five points, three points and one point, and the three finalists are ordered based on total number of points. Voters are provided with a shortlist from which they can select the three players they can choose from, with the winner being announced during the FIFA World Cup held in South Africa in 2010. The winner is chosen by international media Representatives and national Team Coaches and Captains. The award is presented by the French publication France Football, which has published the award since 1956. The original BallonD'Or, also known as the European Footballer of the. Year award, had been awarded by France Football since 1956 and was presented by European sports journalists from among European or Europe-based players. In 2005, France Football and FIFA opted to merge the two awards and the creation of the Ballond'Or was announced in 2007. The Ballon was presented at the 2010 World Cup and Lionel Messi was the first player to win the award. In 2009, Barcelona's Messi was awarded the inaugural Ballon. Messi and Real Madrid's Ronaldo have been the two most successful players in the history of the award, with Ronaldo winning the award in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, as well as the 2014 World Cup.

In the US, it was first produced in 1867 by Rudolph Benkerts in his cellar from pasteurized goat's milk. The Chalet Cheese Cooperative in Monroe, Wisconsin is the only American company that makes this cheese. It is also manufactured in Canada, where it is a German-Canadian cultural marker, by the Oak Grove Cheese Company in New Hamburg, Ontario. The cheese is often spread thick (> 0.5 cm) on firm-textured 100% rye bread, with a large, thick slice of onion, and is typically served with strong black coffee or lager beer. In Wisconsin, the Limburger sandwich can be found on menus at certain restaurants, accompanied by brown mustard. In 2006, a study showing that the malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) is attracted equally to the smell ofLimburger and to the smells of human feet earned the Ig Nobel Prize in the area of biology. The results of the study were published in the medical journal The Lancet on 9 November 1996.28 grams of Limburster contains 5 grams of saturated fat and 8 grams of total fat. 67 of the 92 calories in the 28 grams are from fat. The Limburge sandwich still remains very popular among the descendants of German immigrants residing in the midwest part of America, such as in Cincinnati, or German Village in Columbus, Ohio. However, it is markedly less popular among descendants born after ca. 1960, mainly because of the permeating smell, and the inconvenience of going to specialty cheese and sausage shops to obtain it. The arch-enemy of the Biker Mice from Mars has the name Lawrence Limburgers, complete with terrible body odor. The character was one of the first recurring television detectives. He played the role of Detective Chief Superintendent Tom Lockhart in the Associated-Rediffusion detective series Murder Bag, Crime Sheet and No Hiding Place from 1956 to 1967. His distinguished appearance often led to roles in English series including Dickens, Edward London, Edward Dickens of London, and Edward Edward Edward Damp; he played such parts in a 1984 film The Case of Marcel Duchamp. He also appeared in a 1951 BBC TV series entitled Sherlock Holmes, the earliest TV adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes tales. The Black Sheep Brewery is a brewery in Masham in the Borough of Harrogate in North Yorkshire, England. The brewery was established by Paul Theakston in 1991. It became a public limited company (plc) in 1992. It now produces over 75,000 barrels a year. It re-launched their Emmerdale Ale as a lower-alcohol beer (formerly 5%) on 27 January 2006 at The Crown in Manfield for the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) The launch party saw Chris Chittell (Eric Pollard from the EmMERdale TV series) pull the first pint of the new brew. In 2008, the brewery launched Draught Golden Sheep, a blonde cask beer with a refreshing citrus-hop flavour. This, like all Black Sheep beers and indeed the brewing plant itself was created by Paul Ambler, Head Brewer since 1992 and later Operations Director. All bottled beers brewed by the brewery are suitable for both vegetarians and vegans, and are available at a large number of UK pubs in the Riggwelter UK pubs. Black Sheep Ale (formerly Special Ale), 44%* Black Sheep Best Bitter, 3.8%. The brewery's best-known product, available in the UK pubs is Black Sheep Bitter (5.9%* Bitter), 5.9%. Black Sheep Cask Ale (4.8%* Cask) is available in pubs in England and Wales, and is available on draught in cans in the U.S. and Australia. The Black Sheep ale is available at pubs in Britain and Australia, and can be ordered in cans and bottles from the Black Sheep store in London or the B&Q in the City of London. It is also available in Germany and France. The Brewery is owned by Scottish and Newcastle, who also own Newcastle and Scottish & Scottish Brewing Company. The name Black Sheep was chosen because of its association with sheep. The associations of Masham with sheep led Theakstons to come up with the name ""Sheep Brewery"" which rapidly became ""Black Sheep"" at his wife's suggestion. It was discovered that the Lightfoot name had already been trademarked by Scottish & Newcastle. TheakStons brewery was bought by Matthew Brown following disagreements between members of the family and other shareholders, and in 1987 Matthew Brown was in turn taken over by Scottish&Newcastle. The brewer's son Clive Francis is also an actor. He appeared in several films such as Carrington V.C. and Reach for the Sky. Riggwelter takes its name from the local Yorkshire Dales dialect. The word comes from the old Viking words: ‘rigg’(rygg) meaning back and ‘velte’ to overturn. It is also popular in Sweden, being in the top 20 of bottled ales sold in that country.

""Dakota"" is a song by the Welsh band Stereophonics. It was the first single from their fifth studio album Language. Sex. Violence. Other? and was released on February 28, 2005. It was the first Stereophonics single to reach #1 on the UK Singles Chart or to chart on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song spent a total of 20 weeks on the UK singles chart, and it also topped the download chart, remaining on the chart for 22 weeks, half of which were spent in the top 10. The single received good reviews, James Masterton calling it the single of the year.
""Dakota"" was the first Stereophonics single to achieve success on alternative rock radio stations in the United States, and as such represents their American breakthrough single.[citation needed] Before ""Dakota"", no Stereophonics single had charted on any rock charts in the U.S. After its release in February, the single steadily gained ground on U.S. alternative rock radio. However, since the Stereophonics lacked a fanbase or previous popular success in America, the single was at a great disadvantage and was initially added to very few station playlists. Nevertheless, the popularity of the song and its championing by such stations as WBCN led ""Dakota"" slowly to gain airplay and playlist adds across the country over a period of many months. It became one of the 50 most-played songs in the US by mid-May 2005. However, the song lingered just within the top 50 for months and seemed destined to just miss the Modern Rock Tracks chart, a compilation of just the top 40 most-played alternative rock songs in the US.
But ""Dakota"" continued to gain support across the U.S. and eventually become the first Stereophonics song to chart on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. It first charted on July 9, 2005, almost half a year after its original release. The song reached #34 on the chart; it was their first and so-far only single to make the chart.

Passage:
Rick Deckard
Rick Deckard is a fictional character and the protagonist of Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?.

He was portrayed by Harrison Ford in the 1982 film adaptation Blade Runner directed by Ridley Scott and by James Purefoy in the 2014 BBC Radio 4 adaptation directed by Sasha Yevtushenko. 

Overview 

Rick Deckard is a specialist plainclothes police officer with the San Francisco Police Department in the early 21st Century, who goes after ""andys"" as they are called. In the film adaption (see below), he was/is with the Replicant Detection Division (i.e. Blade Runner unit) of the Los Angeles Police Department. In this version the apprehension and termination of such renegade androids (here known as replicants) is euphemistically referred to as 'retirement'.  Given the nature of this role he could also be considered an officially sanctioned bounty hunter (In the original novel the bounty hunter nature of the position is made more obvious). In both novel & film versions, he begins the story as a selfish, self-involved cop who seemingly sees no value in android life. His experiences within the novel cause him to develop empathy towards androids and all living things. In the film it is implied that he had already begun to undergo this sea change prior to the start of the film, causing his original resignation some time (around May 2019) before its opening. 

Deckard is married to Iran who is one of the more empathetic characters in the novel. She is able to allow herself to go into a depression and sadness with others over the state of humanity, and is able to find the empathy necessary to care for an electric toad at the end of the novel. 

Adaptation 

In the film, the bounty hunters are replaced by police ""Blade Runners"", the androids are called ""replicants"", terms not used in the original novel. The novel depicts Deckard as obsequious and officious ""little man"", so much so it is interesting to note that Dustin Hoffman was involved in the film production for a short time. However it is not documented as to how Hoffman was going to play the character.  In the novel Deckard is human and has a wife but because of the many versions of the film and because of script and production errors, the back story of the movie version of Rick Deckard becomes unclear. The viewer has to make up their own mind as to whether Deckard is a replicant or not and therefore whether he has a past or not. The voice over in the theatrical release indicates Deckard is divorced, as it mentions an ex-wife. However the voice over has been removed from subsequent versions and so this detail is not mentioned. If the viewer takes the perspective that Deckard is a replicant then the ""ex-wife"" only becomes an implanted memory.   Philip K. Dick approved of Harrison Ford's performance, saying that Ford had brought to life ""a genuine, real, authentic Deckard."" 

Before he resigned from his position just prior to the events of the film, Deckard had amassed such a reputation as a Blade Runner that he had gained the nicknames Mr. Nighttime and the Boogeyman.
Question:
Who played Rick Deckard in Blade Runner?
Answer:
Harrison Ford (actor)
Passage:
Headington
Headington is a suburb of Oxford, England.  It is at the top of Headington Hill overlooking the city in the Thames Valley below. The life of the large residential area is centred upon London Road, the main road between London and Oxford.

History

The site of Headington shows evidence of continued occupation from the Stone Age, as the 2001 field excavations in Barton Lane found, suggesting a date in the 11th century BC. Pottery was found on the Manor Ground, suggesting an Iron Age settlement there in the 7th century BC. Roman kilns from about AD 300 have been found, including one now on display at the Museum of Oxford. Anglo-Saxon burial remains from about AD 500 have also been discovered.

Headington's toponym is derived from the Old English Hedena's dun, meaning ""Hedena's hill"", when it was the site of a palace or hunting lodge of the Kings of Mercia. In a charter of 1004, Ethelred II of England, ""written at the royal ville called Headan dune"", gave land in Headington to Frideswide's priory, which included the quarry and the area around it.

Henry I granted a chapel at Headington to the Augustinian canons regular of the Priory of St Frideswide, Oxford when the priory was founded in 1122.Lobel, 1957, pages 157–168 The Church of England parish church of Saint Andrew was built in the middle of the 12th century and enlarged in the 13th century.Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, page 336 The bell tower was started in the 13th or 14th century and completed in about 1500. St. Andrew's was repaired in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Gothic Revival architect J.C. Buckler restored the building and lengthened the nave in 1862–1864.

Headington developed rapidly in the early 20th century, significant amounts of housing developed around the medieval village, now known as Old Headington, around the original parish church of St Andrew. In 1927, it became an urban district separate from the Headington Rural District and in 1929 it was added to the city of Oxford. The other side of the London Road is called New Headington. 

Oxford United was originally Headington United F.C. Until 2001 its home ground was the Manor Ground, which had its main entrance on London Road. In 2001 Oxford United moved to the Kassam Stadium near Blackbird Leys. The Manor Ground has since been demolished and a private hospital built on the site.

The City of Oxford Silver Band began as the Headington Brass Band having been founded in the 19th century.

In 2002 a re-warding of the City created a ward called Headington representing both sides of the London Road, from Bury Knowle Park to Headley Way, with two elected representatives. The first councillors for this  ward were David Rundle (2002–) and Stephen Tall (2002–2008). Ruth Wilkinson was elected to succeed Stephen Tall in May 2008, and Mohammed Altaf-Khan to succeed David Rundle in 2014.

Headington today

Headington has a large and growing population. Headington's main employment sectors are medicine, education, and research. In the centre of Headington are a number of shops, pubs, cafés, restaurants, and other services. The area also includes the main campus of Oxford Brookes University, Ruskin College (which moved in its entirety from central Oxford to its Headington site in 2012), and the city's main hospitals, including the John Radcliffe, Nuffield and Churchill.

Headington's most famous modern landmark is The Headington Shark, made by John Buckley for local broadcaster Bill Heine in 1986.

Headington has a number of green spaces including Headington Hill and Bury Knowle parks. Close by is Shotover Hill, a heath and woodland area with views over Oxfordshire, and listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The Warneford Meadow a wild grassland, bought in 1918 by public subscription for the adjacent Warneford Hospital has been registered as a Town Green and has thus escaped development.

Sport and leisure

Headington has a non-league football team Headington Amateurs F.C. who play at the Barton Recreation Ground.

Notable residents

J. R. R. Tolkien, author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, lived at 76 Sandfield Road in Headington from 1953 until 1968. C. S. Lewis, author of The Chronicles of Narnia, moved to the district in 1921 (he was born in Northern Ireland in 1898) and lived there until moving to The Kilns at nearby Risinghurst in 1930. He lived there until his death in 1963 at The Kilns.  Lewis is buried at Holy Trinity Church at Headington Quarry.

A more recent resident was John Simpson, senior editor of the Oxford English Dictionary. A number of Oxford academics have decamped to Headington over the years, preferring it to North Oxford where most dons lived. They include Lord Krebs, David Marquand and Anthony Kenny. Sir Isaiah Berlin, the historian A. B. Emden, the chemist Dalziel Hammick, Lord Elton, Michael Ernest Sadler and John Johnson (the University Printer) were also among them. Others included music producer Adam Lee, the author Elizabeth Bowen, Robert Maxwell and Lord Nuffield (William Morris) and Anne Diamond, the television presenter and author. Brian Aldiss, the science fiction writer, lives in Old Headington. Emma Watson, Hermione Granger from the Harry Potter films, lives in Headington. She also attended Headington School.

Passage:
Whey
Whey is the liquid remaining after milk has been curdled and strained. It is a co-product of the manufacture of cheese or casein and has several commercial uses. Sweet whey is manufactured during the making of rennet types of hard cheese like cheddar or Swiss cheese. Acid whey (also known as ""sour whey"") is a co-product produced during the making of acid types of dairy products such as cottage cheese or strained yogurt.

Whey proteins consist of α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, serum albumin, immunoglobulins, and a proteose-peptones. 

Production 

To produce cheese, rennet or an edible acid is added to heated milk. This makes the milk coagulate or curdle, separating the milk solids (curds) from the liquid whey. Sweet whey is the co-product of rennet-coagulated cheese and acid whey (also called sour whey) is the co-product of acid-coagulated cheese. Sweet whey has a pH greater than or equal to 5.6, acid whey has a pH less than or equal to 5.1.

Uses 

Whey is used to produce whey cheeses such as ricotta, whey butter, so-called brown cheeses such as Brunost (technically not cheeses at all), and many other products for human consumption. The fat content of whey is low; for example 1,000 kg of whey are required to make typically 1 kg of whey butter.[https://archive.org/stream/CAT31283652/circbai161_djvu.txt C.F. Doane, ""Whey Butter"", Bureau of Animal Industry, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Circular 161 [full text], 23 June 1910.] It is also an additive in many processed foods, including breads, crackers, and commercial pastry, and in animal feed. Whey proteins consist primarily of α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin. Depending on the method of manufacture, whey may also contain glycomacropeptides (GMP).

Dairy whey remaining from home-made cheesemaking has many uses.  It is a flour conditioner and can be substituted for skim milk in most baked good recipes that require milk (bread, pancakes, muffins, etc.).

Whey protein (derived from whey) is often sold as a nutritional supplement. Such supplements are especially popular in the sport of bodybuilding.  In Switzerland, where cheese production is an important industry, whey is used as the basis for carbonated soft drinks such as Rivella and Montino.
In Iceland, liquid whey is sold as Mysa.

Throughout history, whey was a popular drink in inns and coffee houses.  When Joseph Priestley was at college at Daventry Academy 1752–1755, he records that, during the morning of Wednesday 22 May 1754, he “went with a large company to drink whey.”   This was probably ‘sack whey’ or ‘wine whey.'

Another use of whey is to make ‘Cream of Tartar Whey’:  ""Put a pint of blue milk [blue milk is characterized by the appearance on its surface, eighteen or twenty-four hours after it is drawn, of small, indigo-blue fungal spots that rapidly enlarge until the whole surface is covered with a blue film.] over the fire, when it begins to boil, put in two tea spoonfuls of cream of tartar, then take it off the fire, and let it stand till the curd settles to the bottom of the pan, then put it into a basin to cool, and drink it milk warm.”

Whey was also used in central Spain to enrich bakery products. In some traditions, it was used instead of water to produce bread dough.

In areas where cheese is made, excess whey byproduct is sometimes sprayed over hay fields as a fertilizer.

Whey cream and butter

Cream can be skimmed from whey. Whey cream is saltier, tangier, and “cheesier” than (""sweet"") cream skimmed from milk, and can be used to make whey butter. Due to the low fat content of whey the yield is not high, with typically 2 to 5 parts of butter manufactured from 1,000 parts of whey. Whey cream and butter are suitable for making butter-flavoured food, as they have a stronger flavour of their own. They are also cheaper to manufacture than sweet cream and butter.

Health

Because whey contains lactose, it should be avoided by those who are lactose intolerant. Dried whey, a very common food additive, contains 6% lactose. When used as a food additive, whey can contribute to quantities of lactose far above the level of tolerance of most lactose-intolerant individuals.

Liquid whey contains lactose, vitamins, protein, and minerals, along with traces of fat.

In 2005 researchers at Lund University in Sweden found that whey can help regulate and reduce spikes in blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes by increasing insulin secretion.

People can be allergic to whey or other milk proteins (this is an allergy, not lactose intolerance). As whey proteins are altered by high temperatures, whey-sensitive people may be able to tolerate evaporated, boiled or sterilised milk. Hard cheeses are high in casein but low in whey proteins, and are the least allergenic for those allergic to whey proteins. However, casein proteins (which are heat-stable) are the most important allergens in cheese, and an individual may be allergic to either or both types of protein.

Protein

Whey protein is the name of globular proteins that can be isolated from whey. It is typically a mixture of globinstagers beta-lactoglobulin (~65%), alpha-lactalbumin (~25%), and serum albumin (~8%), which are soluble in their native culture forms, independent of pH.
Question:
The terms curds and whey are associated with making what?
Answer:
Cheeses
Passage:
Cromford railway station
Cromford railway station is a railway station owned by Network Rail and managed by East Midlands Trains (EMT) Train operating company (TOC). It is located in the village of Cromford in Derbyshire, England. The station is on the Derwent Valley Line  north of Derby towards Matlock.

Description

The now unstaffed station is served by East Midlands Trains, who operate the service from Nottingham to Matlock (via Derby). For journeys beginning at Cromford, the full range of tickets for travel for any destination in the country are purchased from the guard on the train at no extra cost. Journey time to Derby is approximately 26 minutes. During service disruption, buses will pick up or set down on the A6 main road. Services are approximately hourly, Monday to Saturday, following service improvements in December 2009.

The station, and, in particular, the old Waiting Room, was the setting for the cover artwork of Oasis' single ""Some Might Say"".

Services

The station is served by East Midlands Trains Local with services formed using diesel multiple units of Classes 153, 156, or 158. The service operates from Newark Castle (weekdays only) & Nottingham to Matlock via Derby. Journey time to Derby is approximately 22 minutes. Services are hourly each way Monday to Saturday and two-hourly on Sundays. 

In 2015 East Midlands Trains announced Cromford winner of the 'station environment award'.

History

Originally known as ""Cromford Bridge"", it was opened by the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway in 1849.  This is one of the few stations on the line that has been preserved and is a Grade 2 listed building. It is said to have been designed by G.H.Stokes, son-in-law of Joseph Paxton. It is believed that Stokes also designed Station House (built in 1855), the extremely ornate former Station Master's residence opposite the station on the side of the hill as well as the ornate villa style waiting room, on what was the 'up' platform. According to English Heritage,  this is the original station building. The present station building on the opposite (down) platform was added by the Midland Railway at a later date

Willersley Tunnel, 764 yd long is immediately north of the station.

Following many years of neglect and decline, a long lease on the main station building was purchased by the Arkwright Society, and the building has been restored and improved, re-opening as office space in May 2009. Station House, of which the old Waiting Room is a part, is now self-contained holiday accommodation. 

In the year 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010 journeys from the station had increased by 16.88%. 

Incidents

2009 murder

In September 2009, the station was the site of the motiveless murder of a taxi driver, Stuart Ludlam, by gun fanatic, Colin Cheetham.

Britain and Ireland's top 10 Mountain Ranges
When many people think of the geography of Great Britain, it's likely that they picture  the gentle green rolling hills of the English Cotswolds or our mostly flat urban cities such as London. In actual fact, in between the busy towns and cities lie some pretty spectacular hills and a fair few mountainous regions too. We have put together our 10 top mountain regions in Britain and Ireland.
1. Cairngorms
Scotland
We’ve put the Cairngorms National Park in the number 1 spot  as it’s Britain’s most massive and spectacular Mountain range. Boasting  incredible native forests, dramatic crystal clean rivers and lochs, plenty of  wild Scottish moorland, these beautiful mountains sit in the centre of Scotland  and boast some of Britain’s best views. It is also the largest National Park in  the UK incorporates many beautiful towns and villages. The local wildlife is  extensive and the region plays host to 25% of Britain’s threatened species  making it a great place to see wildlife that you’re unlikely to spot anywhere  else.
2. Mourne Mountains
Northern Ireland
The Mourne Mountains are a granite range which form the  highest peaks in Northern Ireland. The highest of these is Slieve Donard at  850m. The area has been designated an area of outstanding natural beauty and is  very popular with hill walkers and nature lovers. The mountains were said to  have inspired CS Lewis in the writing of the ‘Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe’ with much of Narnia based on this mysterious mountain range. The area was most  recently used as the backdrop for critically acclaimed movie ‘Philomena’ starring Dame Judi Dench.
3. Black Mountains
Wales
Based  on the Eastern side of the Brecon Beacons National Park, the Black Mountain’s  take their name from unsurprisingly from the colour of the landscape in the  region. Sitting on the border between Wales and Herefordshire in England, the  mountains are often confused with the Black Mountain Range which sits on the  Westerly side of the Brecon Beacons. To confuse things even more there is a  mountain within the range called the Black Mountain!
4. MacGillycuddy's Reeks
Ireland
MacGillycuddy's  Reeks means ‘the black stacks’ and sits in County Kerry, Ireland. The centre of  Ireland is pretty much surrounded with mountain ranges but this range contains  the highest peaks in Ireland. The highest mountain is Carrauntoohil which is  1038m high. The range is close to the very pretty Killarney National Park.
5. Grampian Mountains
Scotland
The Grampians occupy a fair proportion of Scotland as one of  the 3 major mountain ranges in the country. It is in the region traditionally  called the Scottish ‘highlands’ and home to Britain’s 2 highest peaks in that  of Ben Nevis and Ben Macdui. Widely regarded as Britain’s most spectacular  view, Glen Coe sits within the range close to Ben Nevis and the town of Fort  William. The Jacobite Steam Railway is an incredible way to see the range as  the ‘Hogwarts Express’ powers along the now famous viaduct with the Grampians forming  a majestic backdrop to a magical and unforgettable journey.
6. Berwyn Range
Wales
Sitting just east of the Snowdonia National Park, this Welsh  range of mountain’s is largely forgotten and overlooked as the peaks sit  slightly lower than its famous neighbour. The bonus is that this region of  mountains and uplands is wholly unspoilt and perfect for anyone looking to get  away from the tourists and walkers who flock to Snowdonia. The mountains top  800m so it’s still a good climb and decent walk for lovers of solitude and  beautiful scenery.
7. Snowdonia
Wales
Snowdonia National Park sits in north Wales and is probably  the most popular region of the country to visit. Mount Snowdon is a challenging  climb for competent walkers but a unique railway will take you to the summit if  you want the views without the exertion. The Snowdonia region can’t boast the  dizzy heights of the Grampian Mountains but with lots of small lakes, steam  railways and simply beautiful views, and lots of attractions this well visited  region is worth a visit all year round.
8. Lake District
England
England is packed with National Parks and rolling hills but  many of these are too low to be classified as mountains. The Lake District  National Park in England’s North West can boast both rolling hills, classic  English countryside and villages, England’s largest lake (Windermere) and  spectacular mountains surrounding them. Although the main draw of the Lake District  is somewhat inevitably the lakes, some of the mountains such as England’s  highest; Scafell Pike (978m) provide an incredibly challenging climb and  rewarding views for those with the inclination.
9. Cheviot Hills
England
The Cheviot Hills sit on the England and Scotland border  just in the north of the Northumberland national Park. The highest hill is the  Cheviot itself which sits at a not unspectacular 815m. The southern area  borders Kielder Forest and is a great open region for walking, roaming and  enjoying the English countryside.
10. Sperrin Mountains
Northern Ireland
The Sperrin Mountains is one of the largest mountainous  regions in Ireland and is a glacial area of upland. The Sperrin's are famous  for their purple heather laded slopes which make this an area of outstanding  natural beauty. It is largely undiscovered though it has a high population in  the urban areas which are incorporated into the Sperrin region.

Passage:
Thomas Arne
Thomas Augustine Arne (; 12 March 1710, London – 5 March 1778, London) was an English composer, best known for the patriotic song Rule Britannia. He also wrote a version of God Save the King, which became the British national anthem, and the song A-Hunting We Will Go. Arne was the leading British theatre composer of the 18th century, working at Drury Lane and Covent Garden.

Early life

Arne was born to an Anglican father and Catholic mother in Covent Garden, and baptised at St. Paul's Church in Covent Garden.

His father and grandfather were both upholsterers and both became officials of the City Company of Upholsterers.  His grandfather fell upon hard times and died in the debtors' prison of Marshalsea.  Arne's father earned enough money not only to rent 31 King Street, a large house in Covent Garden,  but also to have Arne educated at Eton College. In later life, he too lost most of his wealth and had to supplement his income by acting as a numberer of the boxes (ticket counter) at Drury Lane Theatre.

Arne was so keen on music that he smuggled a spinet into his room and, damping the sounds with his handkerchief, would secretly practise during the night while the rest of the family slept. He also dressed up as a liveryman in order to gain access to the gallery of the Italian Opera. It was at the opera that Arne first met the musician and composer Michael Festing, who was a major influence on him. Festing not only taught him to play the violin, but also took him to various musical events, including going to compete against  Thomas Roseingrave for the post of organist at Hanover Square, and a visit to Oxford in 1733 to hear George Frideric Handel's oratorio Athalia.

Upon leaving school, Arne was articled to a solicitor for three years. However, Arne's father discovered his son leading a group of musicians at what was probably one of Festing's musical gatherings. Following this disclosure of his son's real interest and talent, he was persuaded (again probably by Festing) to allow the young Arne to give up his legal career and to pursue music as a living.

Musical career

Between 1733 and 1776, Arne wrote music for about 90 stage works, including plays, masques, pantomimes, and opera. Many of his dramatic scores are now lost, probably in the disastrous fire at Covent Garden in 1808.[http://www.answers.com/topic/thomas-and-sally-or-the-sailor-s-return-opera-in-1-act?cat
entertainment Thomas and Sally, or The Sailor's Return, opera ...: Information and Much More from Answers.com] Arne's sister, Susannah Maria Arne, was a famous contralto, who performed in some of his works, including his first opera, Rosamund. (With her marriage to the Drury Lane actor Theophilus Cibber she became known professionally as ""Mrs Cibber"".) With their brother Richard, they would often perform Arne's works together. 

Arne was a Freemason  and active in the organisation, which has long been centred in the Covent Garden area of London, where Arne lived for many years.

Arne's Catholicism meant that he never composed music for the Church of England, unlike most other leading English composers of his time. 

On 15 March 1737,  Arne married singer Cecilia Young, whose sister, Isabella was the wife of John Frederick Lampe. During this period Arne's operas and masques became increasingly popular, and he received the patronage of Frederick, Prince of Wales, at whose country home, Cliveden, the Masque of Alfred, featuring ""Rule Britannia"", was debuted in 1740.

In 1741, Arne filed a complaint in Chancery pertaining to a breach of musical copyright and claimed that some of his theatrical songs had been printed and sold by Henry Roberts and John Johnson, the London booksellers and music distributors. The matter was settled out of court. Arne was certainly one of the very first composers to have appealed to the law over copyright issues. 

In 1750, after an argument with David Garrick, Susannah left Drury Lane for Covent Garden Theatre, and Arne followed. In 1755 during a period spent in Dublin, he separated from Cecilia, who, he alleged, was mentally ill. He began a relationship with one of his pupils, Charlotte Brent, a soprano and former child prodigy. Brent performed in several of Arne's works, including the role of Sally in his 1760 opera Thomas and Sally and Mandane in his 1762 opera Artaxerxes. Eventually Brent and Arne went their separate ways and she married a violinist named Thomas Pinto in 1766.

During the 1760s Arne frequently collaborated with the Irish writer Isaac Bickerstaffe. Thomas and Sally was the first English comic opera to be sung throughout (it contained no dialogue). Artaxerxes was one of the most successful and influential English operas of the 18th century and is the only known attempt to write an Italianate, Metastasian opera seria, in the English language.  It was frequently performed in London into the 1830s and it was the most popular full-length English opera before the 20th century.   In a 1791 visit to London, Joseph Haydn was impressed by a performance of Artaxerxes he attended and admitted that he had no idea such an opera existed in the English language.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/oct/22/artaxerxes-thomas-arne-linbury-studios Artaxerxes: the opera that time forgot | Music | The Guardian]I

In 1769 Arne composed the song Soft Flowing Avon, with lyrics by Garrick, for the Shakespeare Jubilee held by Garrick in Stratford-upon-Avon to commemorate the life of William Shakespeare.

In 1777, shortly before his death, Arne and his wife were reconciled. They had one son, Michael Arne who was also a composer. Arne is buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, London. A blue plaque, unveiled in 1988, commemorates Arne at 31 King Street in Covent Garden.

Passage:
Sanka
Sanka is a brand of instant decaffeinated coffee, sold around the world, and was one of the earliest decaffeinated varieties. Sanka is distributed in the United States by Kraft Foods.

History

Decaffeinated coffee was developed in 1903 by a team of researchers led by Ludwig Roselius in Bremen, Germany.  It was first sold in Germany and many other European countries in 1905–06 under the name Kaffee HAG (short for Kaffee Handels-Aktien-Gesellschaft, or Coffee Trading Public Company).  In France, the brand name became ""Sanka"", derived from the French words sans caféine (""without caffeine"").  The brand came to the United States in 1909–10, where it was first marketed under the name ""Dekafa"" or ""Dekofa"" by an American sales agent.

In 1914, Roselius founded his own company, Kaffee Hag Corporation, in New York. When Kaffee Hag was confiscated by the Alien Property Custodian during World War I and sold to an American firm, Roselius lost not only his company, but also the American trademark rights to the name. To re-establish his product, he began to use the Sanka brand name in America.

In Europe, the Hag company used the Sanka brand in many countries (The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland amongst others) as a cheaper alternative to the premium brand Coffee Hag. The brand disappeared in these countries after World War II, but it continued until the 1970s as the premium brand in France. First marketed in the U.S. in 1923, Sanka was initially sold only at two Sanka Coffee Houses in New York, but it soon was brought into retail.

Radio, television and other entertainment

The intensive American advertising campaigns included the 1927 broadcasts of Sanka After-Dinner Hour (aka Sanka Music, Sanka After-Dinner Music, Sanka Music Hour and Sanka After-Dinner Coffee Hour), heard at 6:30pm Tuesdays on New York's WEAF.  Sanka was a sponsor of I Love Lucy, The Twilight Zone and The Andy Griffith Show during their respective runs on CBS television in the 1950s and early 1960s.  The Andy Griffith Show Sanka sponsor spots featured the cast members.  It was also a sponsor of the The Goldbergs (1920s-to about 1960 on radio and television not related to the U.S. 2013 ABC television series) where on many programs Mrs. Goldberg (Gertrude Berg) would address the camera and talk to the TV audience and tell them about Sanka coffee. After the sales pitch she would walk away, usually from the window, and start the show.

With such promotion, Sanka became a nationwide sales success with General Foods Corporation taking over distribution in 1928 as a defensive measure, since Sanka directly competed with its non-caffeine coffee substitute Postum. The bright orange label that made Sanka easily identifiable to consumers found its way into coffee shops around the country in the form of the decaf coffee pot. Coffee pots with a bright orange handle are a direct result of the American public's association of the color orange with Sanka, no matter which brand of coffee is actually served. Businesses that serve rival Folgers decaffeinated coffee usually have green-handled pots.

The 1941 Laurel and Hardy comedy Great Guns includes a scene in which Stan Laurel, in an Army mess hall line, is handed a cup of coffee.  He asks ""Sanka?"", and the mess attendant replies, ""You're welcome!""  In the song, ""Bianca,"" in Cole Porter's 1948 musical-comedy Kiss Me, Kate, the lyric ""I would gladly give up coffee for Sanka,"" is included.  Sanka is also mentioned in the 1982 film Fast Times at Ridgemont High, when the science teacher Mr. Vargas declares, ""Look, I'm a little slow today. I just switched to Sanka, so have a heart.""  It is indicated at the end of the film that Mr. Vargas switches back to coffee.

In the 2007 ""Family Guy"" episode ""Peter's Daughter"", four elderly women advertise Sanka by dancing on a beach and chanting ""Don't you wanna wanna Sanka"" in a homage to the Fanta adverts of earlier that decade. It is later mentioned in the episode ""Mother Tucker"" when Thelma Griffin asks for ""a fish sandwich and a Sanka"".

Also, in the third season of the television program ""Entourage"" (episode ""What About Bob?""), the character Bob Ryan, a legendary movie producer who seems to be out of touch with reality, asks for Sanka at a meeting with one of the studio executives while negotiating a deal for one of his scripts.

Sanka albums

In France, Café Sanka issued heraldic picture albums in the same style as the Coffee Hag albums. However, only six albums of the planned 42 were ever published.
Question:
Thanks to the color scheme used on cans and jars of Sanka, the handles on restaurant pots of decaffeinated coffee are traditionally what color?
Answer:
Orange (album)
Passage:
Wanda Ventham
Wanda Ventham (born 5 August 1935) is an English actress, known primarily for her role as Colonel Virginia Lake in the 1970s science-fiction television series UFO, and for her recurring role as Cassandra Trotter's mother Pamela Parry in the sitcom Only Fools and Horses from 1989–92. She has also appeared in two episodes of The Saint alongside Roger Moore.

In April 2014,  People magazine featured her in its ""Most Beautiful People in the World"" edition. 

Early life

Ventham was born in Brighton, the daughter of Gladys Frances (née Holtham) and Frederick Howard Ventham.  She originally held aspirations of becoming an artist and attended art school for one year, working as a scenic painter for the Connaught Theatre during her school holidays. It was her exposure to professional theatre that prompted her to leave art school and pursue a career in acting.  She trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama, along with Judi Dench,  graduating in 1956. 

Career

Ventham's first film role was in My Teenage Daughter (1956), with Anna Neagle and Sylvia Syms. She also appeared in Carry On Cleo (1964) and Carry On... Up the Khyber (1968). She starred alongside Mark Burns in the mystery film, Death is a Woman (1966). Her best known role was on television as Col. Virginia Lake, second in command to Cmdr. Ed Straker (Ed Bishop) in the cult series UFO.

Ventham's numerous other TV credits include regular roles in Heartbeat as Fiona Weston, Hetty Wainthropp Investigates as Margaret Balshaw, and The Rag Trade as Shirley. She also played a love interest for Arthur Daley in Minder, Susan's mother in Coupling, and Deborah's mother in Men Behaving Badly. She appeared in the lead role in the 15-part BBC series The Lotus Eaters (1972–73), opposite Ian Hendry, and made a guest appearance in Rutland Weekend Television. She was in an episode of Danger Man, and the series Patrick McGoohan completed immediately afterwards - the allegorical spy series The Prisoner, as well as the sitcoms Executive Stress and Next of Kin, and the sketch show The Two Ronnies.

She has appeared in Doctor Who on three occasions over three decades: as Jean Rock in The Faceless Ones (1967), as Thea Ransome in Image of the Fendahl (1977) and as Faroon in Time and the Rani (1987). Her appearance in Image of the Fendahl was opposite Denis Lill. Ventham and Lill would later play Pamela and Alan Parry in the sitcom Only Fools and Horses.

In 2014, she and her husband Timothy Carlton appeared in the BBC adaptation of Sherlock as the parents of Sherlock Holmes, who is played by their son Benedict Cumberbatch.  Ventham appeared in Holby City as Myrtle McKee, a hospital patient who leads a double life. 

Personal life

Ventham married her first husband James Tabernacle in 1957  and they had one daughter, Tracy Tabernacle. They were divorced on 12 November 1974.  She met actor Timothy Carlton in 1970 while filming sequences for the drama series A Family at War  and they have been married since April 1976.  The couple appeared together in Series 2 of BBC drama The Lotus Eaters in 1973 and Series 3 of BBC series Sherlock in 2014 as the parents of the title character, played by their real son, actor Benedict Cumberbatch.

The Human Body Parts
The Human Body Parts
The Human Body: Body Parts
The human body is the entire structure of a human organism, and consists of a head, neck, torso, two arms and two legs. By the time the human reaches adulthood, the body consists of close to 10 trillion cells, the basic unit of life. Groups of cells combine and work in tandem to form tissue, which combines to form organs, which work together to form organ systems.
Superficial anatomy or surface anatomy is important in human anatomy being the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily identified from the contours or other reference points on the surface of the body. With knowledge of superficial anatomy, physicians gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures.
Common names of well known parts of the human body, from top to bottom:
Head - Forehead - Jaw - Cheek - Chin
Neck - Shoulders
Arm - Elbow - Wrist - Hand - Fingers - Thumb
Spine - Chest - Thorax
Abdomen - Groin
Hip - Buttocks - Leg - Thigh - Knee - Calf - Heel - Ankle - Foot - Toes
The eye, ear, nose, mouth, teeth, tongue, throat, adam's apple, breast, penis, scrotum, clitoris, vulva, navel are also superficial structures.

Passage:
Maryam Mirzakhani
Maryam Mirzakhani (; born May 13, 1977) is an Iranian-American mathematician and a professor of mathematics at Stanford University.   

In 2014, Mirzakhani became both the first woman and the first Iranian honored with the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics.   The award committee cited her work in ""the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces"". 

Her research topics include Teichmüller theory, hyperbolic geometry, ergodic theory, and symplectic geometry.

Early life and education

Mirzakhani was born in 1977 in Tehran, Iran. She went to high school in Tehran at Farzanegan, National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (NODET).

In 1994, Mirzakhani won a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad, the first female Iranian student to do so. In the 1995 International Mathematical Olympiad, she became the first Iranian student to achieve a perfect score and to win two gold medals.

She obtained her BSc in mathematics (1999) from Sharif University of Technology in Tehran. She went to the United States for graduate work, earning a PhD from Harvard University (2004), where she worked under the supervision of the Fields Medalist Curtis McMullen. She was also a 2004 research fellow of the Clay Mathematics Institute and a professor at Princeton University. 

Research work

Mirzakhani has made several contributions to the theory of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. In her early work, Mirzakhani discovered a formula expressing the volume of a moduli space with a given genus as a polynomial in the number of boundary components. This led her to obtain a new proof for the formula discovered by Edward Witten and Maxim Kontsevich on the intersection numbers of tautological classes on moduli space, as well as an asymptotic formula for the growth of the number of simple closed geodesics on a compact hyperbolic surface, generalizing the theorem of the three geodesics for spherical surfaces.  Her subsequent work has focused on Teichmüller dynamics of moduli space. In particular, she was able to prove the long-standing conjecture that William Thurston's earthquake flow on Teichmüller space is ergodic. 

Most recently as of 2014, with Alex Eskin and with input from Amir Mohammadi, Mirzakhani proved that complex geodesics and their closures in moduli space are surprisingly regular, rather than irregular or fractal.  The closures of complex geodesics are algebraic objects defined in terms of polynomials and therefore they have certain rigidity properties, which is analogous to a celebrated result that Marina Ratner arrived at during the 1990s. The International Mathematical Union said in its press release that, ""It is astounding to find that the rigidity in homogeneous spaces has an echo in the inhomogeneous world of moduli space.""

Mirzakhani was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014 for ""her outstanding contributions to the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces"". 

At the time of the award, Wisconsin professor Jordan Ellenberg explained her research to a popular audience:

President Hassan Rouhani of Iran congratulated her. 

Personal life

She is married to Jan Vondrák, a Czech theoretical computer scientist who works at IBM Almaden Research Center.   They have a daughter named Anahita () .

Passage:
Lúcio Costa
Lúcio Marçal Ferreira Ribeiro Lima Costa  (27 February 1902 – 13 June 1998) was a Brazilian architect and urban planner, best known for his plan for Brasília. 

Career

Costa was born in Toulon, France, son of Brazilian parents.  His father Joaquim Ribeiro da Costa, from Salvador, Bahia, was a naval engineer, and his mother Alina Ferreira da Costa, was from Manaus.  He was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne, England, and at the Collège National in Montreux, Switzerland, until 1916, he graduated as an architect in 1924 from the National School of Fine Arts (Escola Nacional de Belas Artes) in Rio de Janeiro. After some early works in the eclectic manner, he adopted Modernism in 1929. In 1930 Costa established a partnership with Russian-born Brazilian architect Gregori Warchavchik, and also became the Director of the National School of Fine Arts where he had studied. Even though he found students eager to be taught in the ""new style,"" his ruthless administration won him the opposition of the faculty and student body, and Costa eventually had to resign after a year in office. He joined the newly created SPHAN (Servico do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional - National Service of Historic and Artistic Heritage) in 1937 under Rodrigo Melo Franco de Andrade. He remained at the National Heritage Service until retirement, acceding to the top post of director, where he was followed by his granddaughter Maria Elisa Costa. During his tenure as regional and then national director, he became involved in numerous  controversial decisions (see Controversies).

Costa became a figure associated with reconciling traditional Brazilian forms and construction techniques with international modernism, particularly the work of Le Corbusier. His works include the Brazilian pavilion at the New York World's Fair of 1939 (designed with Oscar Niemeyer),  the Parque Guinle residential complex in Rio of 1948, and the Hotel do Park São Clemente in Nova Friburgo of 1948. Among his major works are also the Ministry of Education and Health, in Rio (1936–43), designed with Oscar Niemeyer, Roberto Burle Marx, among others, and consulted by Le Corbusier, and the Pilot Plan of Brasília, a competition winner designed in 1957 and mostly built in 1958-1960. 

Costa taught geometry and drawing at the Liceu de Artes e Ofícios of Rio from 1938-1954. The Liceu was affiliated with the Associação Académica de Coimbra where Costa also taught until 1966, and received a Medal of Merit from the Portuguese government. 

Controversies

During his long tenure as regional, and then later, national chief of the Brazilian Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute (Instituto do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional - IPHAN), Lucio Costa pushed for systematic documentation of existing architectural and urbanistic heritage, although his critics allege that he let his personal preferences and political opinions interfere with the bases of his decisions . In 1975, he created a public controversy by refusing to sign the landmarking act of Palácio Monroe, the former seat of the Brazilian Senate, built in 1906. The building was slated for demolition because of the construction of the subway but, in the face of public and media outcry, the construction company shifted the line to preserve the building. This effort, however, was in vain, since landmark status was denied and a developer razed the building shortly thereafter. Costa  favored the heritage of the Portuguese colonization over that of any other time or ethnic group (except for Brazilian Modernism). Because of this attitude, inculcated also on younger preservationists thanks to Costa's influence in the architecture schools, much of 19th- and early 20th-century architecture, including the architecture of German, Japanese and Italian immigrants, was lost to urban renewal in the 1960s and 1970s.

In 1936, when the competition to design the new Ministry of Education and Health was held, the winner was an eclectic design by architect Arquimedes Memória. Costa used his political connections within the government to scrap the competition result and instead form a new design team headed by himself, the Roberto Brothers and a young architect who had been Costa's intern, Oscar Niemeyer.

He died in Rio de Janeiro in 1998.

Brasilia

Lucio Costa is best known for his urban plan for the new capital of Brasília, located in Brazil's hinterland, having won the job in a 1957 public competition.  Costa's Plano Piloto (Pilot Plan) for Brasília is in the shape of an irregular cross, suggesting an airplane or dragonfly.  Costa's own Parque Guinle project was the model for Brasília's many residential tower-in-a-park superblocks, and Costa specified even the color of the bus drivers' uniforms:  dark grey and with a cap.

Although named as an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987,  the city is notorious for its windswept emptiness and anti-pedestrian layout.    Some streets are badly lit because the height and spacing of light standards were not changed with the advent of mercury-vapor bulbs, and World Heritage Site designation has prevented remediation.

Costa was responsible for the layout, and Oscar Niemeyer responsible for many of the landmark buildings, and there were disputes between the two afterwards as an article in the landmarking decree specifically exempted works from both of them from review by the Heritage Service. Nevertheless, Brasília is also famous for Costa's ""utopian"" project; although not fully accomplished, it has produced a city of considerable quality of life, in which the citizens live in wooded areas with sporting and leisure structure (the ""superquadras"") flanked by small commercial areas, bookstores and cafés; the city is famous for its relative efficiency of traffic.

Even these positive features, however, have sparked controversy, well expressed in the nickname ""ilha da fantasia"" (""fantasy island""), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and the surrounding regions, marked by poverty and disorganization.
Question:
Lcio Costa was the principal urban planner, Oscar Niemeyer was the principal architect, and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer for which purpose-built capital city?

The final section will be released on the 27th of May, and will include a quiz on Rick Deckard, the protagonist of Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (see below) The quiz will also be available for the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of the novel, which airs on BBC Radio 3 on the 28th May. For the BBC adaptation, the character is portrayed by Harrison Ford in the 1982 film adaptation Blade Runner directed by Ridley Scott and by James Purefoy in the 2014 BBC radio 4 adaptation directed by Sasha Yevtushenko. The book is about a plainclothes police officer with the San Francisco Police Department in the early 21st Century, who goes after ""andys"" as they are called. In the film adaption he was/is with the Replicant Detection Division (i.e. the Blade Runner unit) of the Los Angeles Police Department. In this version the apprehension and termination of such renegade androids is euphemistically referred to as'retirement' (in the original novel he could also be considered an officially sanctioned bounty hunter) In the novel he begins the position as a more selfish, self-involved cop who sees no value in android life. His experiences within the novel cause him to develop empathy towards living things and all living things. Deckard is married to Iran who is one of the more empathetic characters in the novel. In the film, the bounty hunters are replaced by police ""Blade Runners"", the androids are called ""replicants"", terms not used in the original novel. The voice over in the theatrical release indicates Deckard is divorced, as it mentions an ex-wife. However the voice over has been removed from subsequent versions and so this detail is not mentioned. Philip K. Dick approved of Harrison Ford's performance, saying that Ford had brought to life ""a genuine, real, authentic Deckard"" Headington is a suburb of Oxford, England. It is at the top of Headington Hill overlooking the city in the Thames Valley below. The life of the large residential area is centred upon London Road, the main road between London and Oxford. Headington's toponym is derived from the Old English Hedena's dun, meaning ""Hedena's hill"", when it was the site of a palace or hunting lodge of the Kings of Mercia. Pottery was found on the Manor Ground, suggesting an Iron Age settlement there in the 7th century BC. Roman kilns from about AD 300 have been found, including one now on display at the Museum of Oxford. Anglo-Saxon burial remains from aboutAD 500 have also been discovered. The Church of England parish church of Saint Andrew was built in the middle of the 12th century and enlarged in the 13th century. St. Andrew's was repaired in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Gothic Revival architect J.C. Buckler restored the building and lengthened the nave in 1862–1864. In 1927, an urban district was added to the other side of the city of New Oxford. Until 2001, its main entrance was the home ground, which had its entrance on London Road. In 200th century, significant amounts of housing developed around the medieval village, now known as Old Headedton, around the original church of St Andrew. In 20th century it became an urbanDistrict and in 1929 it added the New Oxford side. The London Road is called HeadingTON United United United. It was originally its home ground was originally called FC Oxford United United, United United States. In 2000, it was renamed FC United United U.S. Headington has a large and growing population. In the centre of Headington are a number of shops, pubs, cafés, restaurants, and other services. The area also includes the main campus of Oxford Brookes University, Ruskin College, and the city's main hospitals, including the John Radcliffe, Nuffield and Churchill. A number of Oxford academics have decamped to the district over the years, preferring it to North Oxford where most dons lived. The most famous modern landmark is The Headedton Shark, made by John Buckley for local broadcaster Bill Heine in 1986. The Manor Ground has since been demolished and a private hospital built on the site. The City of Oxford Silver Band began as the Headeston Brass Band having been founded in the 19th century. The first councillors for this  ward were David Rundle (2002–) and Stephen Tall ( 2002–2008). Ruth Wilkinson was elected to succeed Stephen Tall in May 2008, and Mohammed Altaf-Khan to succeed David Rundel in 2014. The city has a non-league football team HeadingTON Amateurs F.C. who play at the Barton Recreation Ground. The district is home to the University of Oxford, which moved in its entirety from central Oxford to its Headingon site in 2012. The university's main hospital is the Johnradcliffe Hospital, which has been listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest for the adjacent Warneford Hospital. It is also home to Oxford University's main campuses, including Ruskin college and the JohnRadcliffe and Churchill hospitals. The town is also the home of the Oxford English Dictionary, which was founded in 1921 and moved to its current site in 1972. It also has a number. of green spaces including Shotover Hill, a heath and woodland area with views over Oxfordshire, and listed. as a site of special scientific interest for the nearby Warnefords Forest. It has a population of 2,000. The population of the district is 3,000, with the majority of people living in the central part of the city. The average age of a resident is 48.5 years old, and it has a median house price of £1,200. The council has a budget of £2,500, with a median home value of £800, and a median age of £500, and an average life expectancy of 49. Whey is used to produce whey cheeses such as ricotta, whey butter, and so-called brown cheeses. It is also an additive in many processed foods, including breads, crackers, and commercial pastry, and in animal feed. Whey protein (derived from whey) is often sold as a nutritional supplement. In Switzerland, where cheese production is an important industry, wheY is used as the basis for carbonated soft drinks such as Rivella and Montino. In Iceland, liquid whey is sold as Mysa. People can be allergic to whey proteins. Hard cheeses are high in whey in the case of hard cheeses, but low in hard milk in the other cases. Dried whey, a very common food additive, contains 6% lactose. Because whey contains lactose, it should be avoided by those who are lactose intolerant.Whey cream and butter are suitable for making butter-flavoured food, as they have a stronger flavour of their own. They are also cheaper to manufacture than sweet cream and Butter. The low fat content of whey means that the yield is not high, with typically 2 to 5 parts of butter manufactured from 1,000 parts of Whey. The high pH of acid-coagulated cheese means that it can be used as a flour conditioner and can be substituted for skim milk in most baked good recipes that require milk (bread, pancakes, muffins, etc.) Whey can also be used to make butter and cream, but it is not as popular as butter and creme de creme. It can be evaporated, boiled or sterilised, or boiled or boiled in a sterilised sterilised or boiled sterilised container. It has been used in the production of cheese, butter, cream, and cheese sauce, as well as many other products for human consumption. It was also used in central Spain to enrich bakery products. In some traditions, it was used instead of water to produce bread dough. It also contains traces of fat, along with vitamins, minerals, lactose and traces of lactose protein, and lactose-intolerant people may have a low tolerance to it. In 2005 researchers at Lund University in Sweden found that whey can help regulate and reduce spikes in blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes by increasing insulin secretion by increasing the level of the insulin-like growth factor (ILG) in the blood. The whey protein is the least allergic to those allergic to milk proteins. Cromford railway station is located in the village of Cromford in Derbyshire, England. The station is on the Derwent Valley Line north of Derby towards Matlock. It was opened by the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway in 1849. It is said to have been designed by G.H.Stokes, son-in-law of Joseph Paxton. The old Waiting Room was the setting for the cover artwork of Oasis' single ""Some Might Say"" The now unstaffed station is served by East Midlands Trains, who operate the service from Nottingham to Matlock (via Derby). For journeys beginning at Cromford, the full range of tickets for travel for any destination in the country are purchased from the guard on the train at no extra cost. Journey time to Derby is approximately 26 minutes. During service disruption, buses will pick up or set down on the A6 main road. Services are approximately hourly, Monday to Saturday, following service improvements in December 2009. In September 2009, the station was the site of the motiveless murder of a taxi driver, Stuart Ludlam, by gun fanatic, Colin Cheetham. The building has been restored and improved, re-opening as office space in May 2009. Station House, of which the old waiting room is a part, is now self-contained holiday accommodation. The service operates from Newark Castle (weekdays only) & Nottingham toMatlock via Derby. In the year 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010 journeys from the station had increased by 16.88%. The station has the three-letter code CMF, which means 'curd', 'cheeses' and 'cheese' It is one of the few stations on the line that has been preserved and is a Grade 2 listed building. The former Station Master's residence opposite the station on the side of the hill as well as the ornate villa style waiting room, on what was the 'up' platform, was added by the Midland Railway at a later date. The train station is named after James Earl Gonzales, a dedicated public servant and exceptionally qualified to be our nation's next Attorney General. It has been said that a lot of the story of Gonzales' life has been a fulfillment of a story of the American Dream. Britain and Ireland's top 10 mountain ranges, Great British Trips. Cairngorms National Park is Britain's most massive and spectacular Mountain range. The Grampians occupy a fair proportion of Scotland as one of the 3 major mountain ranges in the country. The Black Mountains take their name from unsurprisingly from the colour of the landscape in the region. MacGillycuddy's Reeks means ‘the black stacks’ and sits in County Kerry, Ireland. The highest mountain is Carrauntoohil which is  1038m high. The Snowdonia National Park sits in north Wales and is probably the most popuuuur of the UK's mountain ranges. The most spectacular mountain range in Ireland is the Mourne Mountains which are a granite range which form the  highest peaks in Northern Ireland. They are said to have inspired CS Lewis in the writing of the ‘Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe’ with much of Narnia based on this mysterious mountain range. They were most recently used as the backdrop for critically acclaimed movie ‘Philomena’ starring Dame Judi Dench. The mountains top 800m so it’s still a good climb and decent walk for lovers of solitude and solitude. The region plays host to 25% of Britain's threatened species making it a great place to see wildlife that you’re unlikely to spot anywhere else. The area has been designated an area of outstanding natural beauty and is  very popular with hill walkers and nature lovers. The Jacobite Steam Railway is an incredible way to see the range as the � ‘Hogwarts Express’ powers along the now famous viaduct with the Grampian Mountains forming  a majestic backdrop to a magical and unforgettable journey. The  highest mountain in the area is Slieve Donard at 850m. The range is close to the very pretty Killarney National Park and is popular with tourists and walkers. The mountain range is largely forgotten and overlooked as the peaks sit slightly lower than its famous neighbour and is wholly unspoilt and perfect for anyone looking to get away from tourists who flock to the region to get a good view of the mountains. It is also a good walk to get  away from the tourists and get away the region and uplands. This is the first time we can see how many of these are too low to be classified as ""crying out"" or ""crowing out"" over the state of the nation. This is how many have tried to see which is the best way to see how far this is from the current state of the world. This can be as far as how many people want to know what is going to be the next big thing to happen in the next few days. This could be as much as the number of people who want to find out what is the next thing that will happen on the next day's news, or how long it will take to get to the end of this article. These are just a few of the many ways to see if this is the beginning or end of the world for the first day of the new year. Here are a few ideas on what this could mean for the future of this nation's news cycle. These can be found on the Crony's Daily Mail, The Guardian, CNN, and The American Spectator. This could be the start of a new era of news reporting on what is happening in the world of the media, or it could be the beginning of the first week of the year for the next generation of media outlets to report on what's happening in America. Here is a look at some of the places to look for this year's biggest news stories in the media. These are: how many people would like to see what the next year's news will be like, and how many are willing to bet on it will be a big change in the way they see the world. These include the world's economy is changing, and what the future may be like. Here's a list of some of these places, from the CNN and which is the most interesting to watch. This list includes how many people are going to try and see if there are any changes in the news in the coming months. This includes whether this is or how long it takes to get from this to the next corporation to be the first to see the next ""big thing"" This is just a sampling of how many would-be takers would want to see this year’s news. Arne wrote music for about 90 stage works, including plays, masques, pantomimes, and opera. Many of his dramatic scores are now lost, probably in the disastrous fire at Covent Garden in 1808. Arne's Catholicism meant that he never composed music for the Church of England, unlike most other leading English composers of his time. In 1741, Arne filed a complaint in Chancery pertaining to a breach of musical copyright and claimed that some of his theatrical songs had been printed and sold by Henry Roberts and John Johnson, the London booksellers and music distributors. His opera Artaxerxes was one of the most successful and influential English operas of the 18th century and is the only known attempt to write an Italianate, Metastasian opera seria, in the English language. Thomas and Sally was the first English comic opera to be sung throughout (it contained no dialogue). In 1769 Arne composed the song Soft Flowing Avon, with lyrics by David Garrick, for the Shakespeare Jubilee held by Garrick in Stratford-upon-Avon to commemorate the life of William Shakespeare. In 1988, a blue plaque was unveiled at 31 King Street, commemorating Arne in Covent garden, in 1988. A team of researchers developed a decaffeinated version of Sanka coffee sold around the world, which was developed in 1903 by Kraft Foods in the United States. Sanka is now sold in the U.S. in the early stages of the Sanka Decaffeinated Sanka line of coffee, which is sold in stores and on the internet. It was developed by a team of le le le researchers from the University of le Monde, Paris, and the Paris School of Music, and is available for pre-order on the Amazon.com website for £3.99. For more information on the Decaffeination Decaffeinate Sanka Line, visit the Kraft Foods website. for more information about the Decaff Decaff Sanka range of coffees, see www.kraftfoods.com/decaffeinated-sanka-coffee-on-the-market-in-the US and the Amazon.com site for details. For the full list of questions, visit www.themailonline.co.uk/news/health/health-and-beauty/top-10-questions-ask-about-thomas-arne-s-most-famous-composers. First marketed in the U.S. in 1923, Sanka was initially sold only at two Sanka Coffee Houses in New York. In the song, ""Bianca,"" in Cole Porter's 1948 musical-comedy Kiss Me, Kate, the lyric ""I would gladly give up coffee for Sanka"" Sanka is also mentioned in the 1982 film Fast Times at Ridgemont High, when the science teacher Mr. Vargas declares, ""Look, I'm a little slow today. I just switched to Sanka, so have a heart."" It is also a sponsor of I Love Lucy, The Twilight Zone and The Andy Griffith Show during their respective runs on CBS television in the 1950s and early 1960s. The bright orange label that made Sanka easily identifiable to consumers found its way into coffee shops around the country in the form of the decaf coffee pot. The brand disappeared in these countries after World War II, but it continued until the 1970s as the premium brand in France. It is later mentioned in an episode of ""Mother Tucker"" when Thelma Griffin asks for ""a fish sandwich"" that is later later revealed to be Sanka. It was first sold in Germany and many other European countries in 1905–06 under the name Kaffee HAG (short for KaffEE Handels-Aktien-Gesellschaft, or Coffee Trading Public Company) In France, the brand name became ""Sanka"", derived from the French words sans caféine (""without caffeine"").  The brand came to the United States in 1909–10, where it was first marketed under the names ""Dekafa"" or 'Dekofa"" by an American sales agent. In Europe, the Hag company used the Sanka brand in many countries (The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland amongst others) as a cheaper alternative to the premium brands Coffee Hag and Postum. In 1928, General Foods Corporation took over distribution in 1928 as a defensive measure, since Sanka directly competed with its non-caffeine coffee substitute Postum, and Sanka became a nationwide sales success. The Sanka coffee pot with a bright orange handle is a direct result of the American public's association of the color orange with Sanka - no matter which brand of coffee is actually served.

In France, Café Sanka issued heraldic picture albums in the same style as the Coffee Hag albums. However, only six albums of the planned 42 were ever published.Thanks to the color scheme used on cans and jars of Sanka, the handles on restaurant pots of decaffeinated coffee are traditionally what color? Orange (album) or blue (album)? What color is the handle on a cup of coffee? What is the name of the character in The Human Body Parts? What do you think of the film The Human Parts?

In August 2014 Maryam Mirzakhani became the first woman to be awarded the Fields Medal. She proved that complex geodesics and their closures in moduli space are surprisingly regular, rather than irregular or fractal. She is married to Jan Vondrák, a Czech theoretical computer scientist who works at IBM Almaden Research Center. Lúcio Marçal Ferreira Ribeiro Lima Costa (27 February 1902 – 13 June 1998) was a Brazilian architect and urban planner, best known for his plan for Brasília. He joined the newly created SPHAN (Servico do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional - National Service of Historic and Artistic Heritage) in 1937. Even though he found students eager to be taught in the ""new style,"" his ruthless administration won him the opposition of the faculty and student body, and Costa eventually had to resign after a year in office. And he was involved in numerous controversial decisions (see Controversies). During his tenure and then national director, he became a figure associated with numerous controversies. He was followed by Elisa Costa, followed by his granddaughter Maria Costa, and then by his son-in-law, Carlos Costa. He died in Rio de Janeiro in 1998 at the age of 89. He is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son- in-law. He also leaves behind a wife and two grandchildren. He has a daughter named Anahita, who is also a computer scientist. He had a son named Carlos Costa, who also works for IBM. He and his wife Elisa are followed by three daughters, who are also computer scientists and have a son, Carlos Costa, a professor of computer science at the University of California, San Diego. He passed away in 2008 at age 89. His daughter Elisa is now the director of the National Academy of Sciences of Iran. She has been awarded the National Medal for her contributions to the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces. She also received the 2013 AMS Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics. She was named one of Nature's ten ""people who mattered"" of 2014 by the American Philosophical Society in 2015. Lucio Costa was a Brazilian architect. He is best known for his urban plan for Brasília, Brazil's hinterland. Costa taught geometry and drawing at the Liceu de Artes e Ofícios of Rio from 1938-1954. He died in Rio de Janeiro in 1998 and is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter. His works include the Brazilian pavilion at the New York World's Fair of 1939 (designed with Oscar Niemeyer),  the Parque Guinle residential complex in Rio of 1948, and the Hotel do Park São Clemente in Nova Friburgo of 1948. In 1975, he created a public controversy by refusing to sign the landmarking act of Palácio Monroe, the former seat of the Brazilian Senate, built in 1906. The building was slated for demolition because of the construction of the subway but, in the face of public and media outcry, the construction company shifted the line to preserve the building. This effort, however, was in vain, since landmark status was denied and a developer razed the building shortly thereafter. Costa favored the heritage of the Portuguese colonization over that of any other time or ethnic group (except for Brazilian Modernism). Because of this attitude, inculcated also on younger preservationists thanks to Costa's influence in the architecture schools, much of 19th- and early 20th-century architecture, including the architecture of German, Japanese and Italian immigrants, was lost to urban renewal in the 1960s and 1970s. Costa's Plano Piloto (Pilot Plan) is in the shape of an irregular cross, suggesting an airplane or dragonfly. Costa specified even the color of the bus drivers' uniforms:  dark grey and with a cap. Costa was responsible for the layout, and Oscar Nimeyer responsible for many of the landmark buildings, and there were disputes between the two afterwards. Although named as an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987,  the city is notorious for its windswept emptiness and anti-pedestrian layout. Nevertheless, Brasíilia is also famous for Costa's ""utopian"" project, which has produced a city of considerable quality of life, in which the citizens live in wooded areas. Sporting and leisure structure (the ""superquadras"") flanked by small commercial areas, bookstores and cafés; the city is famous for its relative efficiency of traffic. Even these positive features, however, have sparked controversy, well expressed in the nickname ""ilha da fantasia"" (""fantasy island""), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and the surrounding regions."

Question:
What is a “Scotch Bonnet”?
Answer:
","Passage:
Patrick Cox
Patrick Cox (born March 19, 1963) is a Canadian–British fashion designer and an eponymous fashion label specializing in the creation of shoes, leather goods and accessories. Cox is most noted for the use of unusual materials and a mixture of avant-garde and traditional styles.

Born 19 March 1963, in Edmonton, Canada, to a ballerina Canadian mother and linguist English father, Cox was educated locally, except for periods when his father's work led the family to postings in Nigeria, Chad and Cameroon. Cox eventually graduated from school in Edmonton Canada and moved to Toronto on his own when he was 17.

Early career 

At the age of 19, Cox produced his first pair of shoes, for the Toronto-based designer Loucas Kleanthous, who suggested Cox consider a career as a designer. An interest in British fashion led Cox to study at Cordwainer's Technical College, London, a design school that was absorbed into the London College of Fashion in 2000. Cox studied at Cordwainer's from 1983 to 1985. He graduated with merit in July 1985.

During his time as a student in London, Cox probably spent as much time in nightclubs as he did studying. Through his partying Cox became friends with several well-known designers, such as the legendary Vivienne Westwood. As a result, in 1984, Westwood asked Cox to design shoes for her ""Clint Eastwood"" collection. One of the shoes that Cox created incorporated a 4-inch platform that would become the prototype of a 9-inch pair later worn by supermodel Naomi Campbell, when she famously fell during a Westwood fashion show in Paris, France in 1993. In his second year of college Cox designed and handmade fluorescent fringed moccasins for the celebrated Body Map brand of David Holah and Stevie Stewart.

Personal life

Cox used to date Canadian journalist, entrepreneur, and magazine publisher Tyler Brûlé. Cox funded the launch of Brule's Wallpaper magazine that was subsequently sold to Time Warner in 1997.  They split up in 1997.

Working life 

Cox set up his own company designing shoes in 1985, and in 1986 designed the shoes for John Galliano's ""Fallen Angels"" collection. Subsequently, Cox launched his own Patrick Cox label, adopting the fleur-de-lys logo. Cox continued to work with Galliano for a further six seasons. He also produced the shoes for numerous designers' fashion shows including Anna Sui, John Flett, Alistair Blair and Lanvin Haute Couture to name but a few.

In 1991 Cox opened his first shop opposite the Peter Jones department store in Sloane Square, Chelsea, a well-known fashion district of London. In 1993, Cox marketed his first collection designed for the mass market. This diffusion range called ""Wannabe"" increased the company's semi annual sales from 2000 to 200,000 pairs.  Cox has credited his initial interest in moccasins  to fellow designer Richard James whom had asked Cox to design him a modern loafer to accessorise one of his early 1990's fashion shows.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/fashion-and-style/11006514/Patrick-Cox-lessons-from-the-stylish.html

In 1994, Cox opened his first Parisian store on the right bank, followed in 1995 by a second store in London on Sloane Street, a new store on New York's Madison Avenue and a second store in Paris on the left bank. During this time, Cox was twice awarded Accessory Designer of the Year at the British Fashion Awards. 1998 saw Cox move his design office and production from the UK to Civitanova, in the Italian  Marche, an area known for shoe manufacture.

From his early association with Vivienne Westwood onwards Cox developed a cult like status in Japan and in 1996 signed a 10 year licensing deal with the leading Japanese luxury department store group Isetan. This deal saw the opening of more than 40 shop in shops across Japan and a whole range of licensed Japanese product including ready to wear, bags, jewellery and watches.

Cox was approached by the French fashion footwear house Charles Jourdan, and in January 2003 he was appointed Creative Director, his brief being to rejuvenate the brand. After 3 years of successful collaboration, Cox decided to move on to concentrate on the development of his own label. 

The Hong Kong duty free company King Power Group took a controlling interest in the Patrick Cox company in 2006. Cox left his eponymous the following year and the entire business, except for a few continuing Japanese licenses was closed in 2008.

In September 2010, Cox opened 'Cox Cookies & Cake', a pâtisserie in London's Soho district, with Eric Lanlard to whom he was introduced by Elizabeth Hurley.  In keeping with the area's history of seedy business, the décor was black and neon while the staff wore studded leather aprons.  Delicacies included titty and bum cupcakes along with his mother Maureen's recipe for traditional Canadian Nanaimo bars. After 2 successful years trading Cox decided to close the business to return to shoe design.

In 2011 Cox was approached to design for the Italian shoe giantGeox. The resulting GEOX Designed by Patrick Cox capsule collection perfectly incorporates his witty ironic British take on design with their leading edge Italian technology. This collaboration continues successfully in its 4th year.

For Autumn/Winter 2015 Cox returns to fashion with his Lathbridge collection of shoes and leather goods. The brand name is Cox' middle name and the company logo is the bulldog inspired by Cox' much loved 2 English bulldogs Caesar and Brutus.
Question:
Patrick Cox is known as a designer of what?

When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life.
""Why, Sir, you find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.""
— Samuel Johnson
Boswell and Johnson were discussing whether or not Boswell's affection for London would wear thin should he choose to live there, as opposed to the zest he felt on his occasional visits. (Boswell lived in Scotland, and visited only periodically.  Some people are surprised to learn that Boswell and Johnson were far from inseparable over the last twenty years of Johnson's life, the period Boswell knew him.)
This discussion happened on September 20, 1777, and Johnson, someone who hated to spend time alone, was always going out and enjoying what London had to offer.

Zolotoy Rog
Zolotoy Rog Bay () is a sheltered horn-shaped bay separated from the Peter the Great Gulf of the Sea of Japan by Shkota Peninsula on the north-west, Cape Goldobina on the east-north-east, and Cape Tigrovy on the west. The bay is seven kilometers long, with a width of about two kilometers and a depth ranging from 20 to 27 meters. The Russian port of Vladivostok lies on the hills at the head of the bay.

Until the mid-19th century, the bay had been known to the Chinese as the ""Gamat Bay"". The first European ship known to have anchored in the bay was a French whaler in 1852. During the Crimean War, the British ship Winchester visited the bay while searching for Vasily Zavoyko's squadron. The British sailors called it Port May. In 1859, Count Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky gave the harbour its present name, which means ""Golden Horn"" in Russian, alluding to a similarly shaped harbour in Constantinople.

Heptathlon
A heptathlon is a track and field combined events contest made up of seven events. The name derives from the Greek hepta (seven) and athlon (contest). A competitor in a heptathlon is referred to as a heptathlete.

There are two heptathlons – the women's heptathlon and the men's – composed of different events. The men's heptathlon is older and is held indoors, while the women's is held outdoors and was introduced in the 1980s, first appearing in the Olympics in 1984.

Women's heptathlon

Women's heptathlon is the combined event for women contested in the Athletics program of the Olympics and in the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The IAAF World Combined Events Challenge determines a yearly women's heptathlon champion. The women's outdoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and the remaining three on day two:

* 100 metres hurdles
* High jump
* Shot put
* 200 metres
* Long jump
* Javelin throw 
* 800 metres

The heptathlon has been contested by female athletes since the early 1980s, when it replaced the pentathlon as the primary women's combined event contest (the javelin throw and 800 m were added).  It was first contested at the Olympic level in the 1984 Summer Olympics. In recent years some women's decathlon competitions have been conducted, consisting of the same events as the men's competition in a slightly different order, and the IAAF has begun keeping records for it, but the heptathlon remains the championship-level combined event for women. Jessica Ennis-Hill, representing Great Britain, is the 2012 Olympic Gold Medallist and the current World Champion.

There is also a Tetradecathlon, which is a double heptathlon, consisting of 14 events, seven events per day.

Points system

The heptathlon scoring system was devised by Dr Karl Ulbrich, a Viennese mathematician. The formulae are constructed so that, for each event, a designated ""standard"" performance (for example, approximately 1.82 m for the high jump) scores 1000 points.  Each event also has a minimum recordable performance level (e.g. 0.75 m for the high jump), corresponding to zero points. The formulae are devised so that successive constant increments in performance correspond to gradually increasing increments in points awarded.

The events are split into three groups, and the scores are calculated according to the three formulae: 

Running events (200 m, 800 m and 100 m hurdles):
:P = a \cdot (b - T)^c
Jumping events (high jump and long jump):
:P = a \cdot (M - b)^c
Throwing events (shot put and javelin):
:P = a \cdot (D - b)^c

P is for points, T is for time in seconds, M is for height or length in centimeters and D is length in meters. a, b and c have different values for each of the events (see table).

Benchmarks

The following table shows the benchmark levels required to earn 1000 points in each event of the heptathlon:

Women's world records compared to heptathlon bests

Men's heptathlon

 

The other version is an indoor competition, normally contested by men only. It is the men's combined event in the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics. The men's indoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and remaining three on day two:

* 60 metres
* long jump
* shot put
* high jump
* 60 metres hurdles
* pole vault
* 1000 metres

The scoring is similar for both versions. In each event, the athlete scores points for his/her performance in each event according to scoring tables issued by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).  The athlete accumulating the highest number of points wins the competition.

Venice Gondolas and Gondola Rides - Europe for Visitors
Venice Gondolas and Gondola Rides
Gondolas and Gondola Rides
How to hire a gondolier in Venice, plus a money-saving alternative to gondolas on the Grand Canal.
By Durant Imboden
There are two important rules to remember about gondola rides in Venice:
If the price bothers you, don't do it.
If the price doesn't bother you, make sure you understood the gondolier correctly.
Fact is, a gondola cruise in Venice is like traveling by hansom cab in New York's Central Park: It can be a delightful experience, but only if you're able to forget the price and focus on the ride.
ABOVE: A gondola carries up to six passengers. INSET BELOW: A gondolier in a traditional straw hat, happy gondola passengers, and a squero where gondolas are built and repaired.
What a gondola ride costs
The city of Venice sets official rates for gondola rides, which started at €80 for 40 minutes the last time we checked. Additional 20-minute increments are  €40. After 7 p.m., the base rate climbs to €100, with €50 for an additional 20 minutes. Up to six people can share a gondola.
This doesn't mean you'll actually pay 80 euros, or that you'll get a 40-minute ride. Depending on demand, gondoliers may regard the official rates as a polite fiction. Special services, such as singing, can boost the fare even more. This means you should negotiate both the rate and the length of the ride before you get into the boat. Otherwise, your gondola ride may be memorable for reasons that have nothing to do with sightseeing.
If you dislike negotiating, you can leave that chore to your hotel concierge, though he (or she) may add a hefty surcharge. A few years ago, a reader told us that he'd paid the Hotel Bauer's concierge €120 for a gondola ride just before Carnevale , but he added that he didn't mind the rate and got great service. Another reader (presumably well-heeled) spent a mind-boggling €150 for a 50-minute ride and thought the expenditure was ""well worth it.""
To be fair to Venice's gondoliers, they invest a great deal in their boats: about €20,000 for a traditional hand-built wooden gondola with a useful life of about 20 years. They need to earn the bulk of their annual income in a few short months.
Finally, a gondolier's living costs may be higher than yours, since Venice is an expensive city in one of Italy's wealthiest provinces. Look it at this way: The man who's rowing you up the Grand Canal probably could earn more money for less work at an industrial plant on the mainland.
Question:
In which city would you travel in a gondola?
Answer:
Sestiere (Venice)
Passage:
Matola
Matola is the largest suburb of the Mozambique capital, Maputo, and adjacent to it to the west. It is the nation's second most populated place.  Matola is the capital of Maputo Province and has had its own elected municipal government since 1998. It has a port and also the biggest industrial area in Mozambique. The population of Matola is, according to the 2007 census, 675,422 inhabitants,  having increased to a 2014 projected population (Instituto Nacional de Estatistica Moçambique) of 893,000. 

Etymology

Matola, which is also a common family name, comes from Matsolo a Ronga kingdom that existed in this region when the colonists arrived.

Industry 

Matola is an industrial centre with an important port for minerals (chromium and iron) and other exports from Swaziland and South Africa. It has petroleum refineries (presently inactive) and diverse industries, which manufacture products like soap, cement, and agricultural materials. The most important of these is an aluminium smelter, installed in 2002, that more than doubled Mozambique's GDP. In November 2014, South Korean car company Hyundai Motor Company opened a plant in Matola, which manufactures the Hyundai i10 and Hyundai Accent. 

Transport 

Matola is served by a station on the southern network of Mozambique Ports and Railways.  Coal is exported from here.

Geography 

Matola is also the name of a small river (some 30 km long), that makes the northern border of the Matola municipality, and flows into Maputo Bay.

Started By CSULB Professor, Kwanzaa Celebrates The Importance Of African Culture
Details
 Comment 
[Eds. note: I originally wrote about Kwanzaa when I was the Managing Editor of City Beat Long Beach and a version of this piece originally appeared in the December 2011 issue of that magazine. Since City Beat is no more and their website has been taken down as well (and Dr. Karenga has yet to return our calls), I received permission to re-run this relevant piece on this important holiday that has some epic roots in our own backyard.]
Though its history is much younger than the other holidays celebrated during this time of year, Kwanzaa is by no means less significant. Created in 1966 by Dr. Maulana Karenga as a way for African-Americans to honor their shared heritage and culture, the seven-day celebration—which begins today, December 26, and goes until January 1—has become an important holiday for those with black heritage worldwide.
Starting today with a parade down Crenshaw Blvd., the 36th annual Kwanzaa Gwaride Parade and Festival will be the largest Kwanzaa kickoff celebration in Southern California. With this year's festival theme being ""Freedom from Obesity,'' the parade's Iyaba (queen) and Oba (king) are both medical practitioners. The Kwanzaa Heritage Festival will also be held in Leimert Park on December 29 and will include live music, traditional dancing, a drum circle and international marketplace. 
In his 2012 founders statement , Dr. Karenga Kwanzaa discusses his theme for this year's Kwanzaa, ""Us and the Well-being of the World: A Courageous Questioning.""
""At the center of this concern and care must be a constant and courageous questioning first about how we understand and assert ourselves in the world and what this means,"" Dr. Karenga wrote. ""Thus, the Day of Meditation during Kwanzaa which is the culminating point and place of our remembrance, reflection and recommitment calls on us to sit down, think deeply about ourselves in the world, and measure ourselves in the mirror of the best of our culture to determine where we stand.""
The word Kwanzaa comes from the Swahili phrase matunda ya kwanza which translates roughly to “first fruit”), and the holiday’s template is loosely based on traditional pan-African harvest festivals. But that is where any precedent stops. As an internationally celebrated, non-religious, non-heroic, non-political African-American holiday, Kwanzaa is a unique experience that encourages unity among those of African descent and attempts to preserve common African culture.
Dr. Karenga—a leading theorist during the ’60s Black Power Movement who is now the chair of Cal State Long Beach's Department of Africana Studies—organized Kwanzaa around a set of communitarian African values, called the Nguzo Saba. These seven principles include Umoja (unity), Kujicahgulia (self-determination), Ujima (collective work and responsibility), Ujama (cooperative economics), Nia (purpose), Kuumba (creativity) and Imani (faith). Each day of Kwanzaa focuses on one of these driving principles and is expressed through the lighting of colored candles, dancing, reciting poetry and the giving of appropriate gifts.
In addition to the daily celebrations, Kwanzaa calls for a central place in the home to be dedicated to the construction of a Kwanzaa Set—a display of the holiday’s symbolic objects. Central to this is the kinara, a candleholder that carries the seven candles—three red, three green and one black—as well as a Unity Cup, the filling and sharing of which is a central Kwanzaa ritual. Ears of corn are placed on the Kwanzaa Set's staw mat, each representing a child in the family. African foods such as millet, spiced pepper balls and rice are often served, though some people fast during the holiday and a feast is often held on its final night.
While Kwanzaa was originally directed at a small group of activists, it gained popularity as interest in multiculturalism expanded in the late 1980s and has since coexisted alongside Christmas and Hanukkah celebrations for both black and white families nationwide. Though estimates of the number of people who celebrate the holiday worldwide vary—from 250,000 to 40 million—Los Angeles is seen as the cultural epicenter and birthplace of the holiday and has multiple Kwanzaa celebrations, several of which have in the past taken place in Long Beach including one at the Long Beach Senior Center and another annually organized by Village Treasures , an African art store in the historic Lafayette building.
Question:
What holiday, created by a future Cal State Long Beach professor in 1966, is celebrated the day after Christmas for 7 days?
Answer:
Kwanzaa
Passage:
Menlove Ave.
Menlove Ave. is a 1986 album by English rock musician John Lennon. It is the second posthumous release of Lennon's music, having been recorded during the sessions from his albums Walls and Bridges and Rock 'n' Roll. Menlove Ave. was released under the supervision of Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow.

Background

The first side of the LP comprises session outtakes from the Rock 'n' Roll sessions with Phil Spector in late 1973, save for ""Rock and Roll People"" which is from the Mind Games sessions.  The remainder features rehearsal recordings in mid-1974 for Walls and Bridges.

The song ""Rock and Roll People"" was originally recorded and released on Johnny Winter's seventh studio album John Dawson Winter III.

The title refers to Lennon's childhood home, 251 Menlove Avenue, in Liverpool. Menlove Avenue is a long road in South Liverpool, part of the Liverpool ring road. While it is mainly residential, it is also a primary route - the A562. It also passes Woolton Village where Lennon and Paul McCartney first met.

Album cover

The artwork for the release was effected by artist Andy Warhol, just months before Lennon's death in 1980.  It was later used as a cover for 2005 compilation album Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon.

Reception and Aftermath

Though Menlove Ave. included previously unreleased material of John Lennon, it failed to chart in the United Kingdom. It did manage to reach number 127 in the United States, making it Lennon's least-successful album. Menlove Ave. has not been printed since 1986.

Tracks 3-5 appeared as bonus tracks in the 2004 remastered version of Rock 'n' Roll.
The song ""Here We Go Again"" was included on the 2006 soundtrack album The U.S. vs. John Lennon and 2010 box set Gimme Some Truth.

The Ministry of Fear
The Ministry of Fear is a 1943 novel written by Graham Greene. It was first published in Britain by William Heinemann. It was made into the 1944 film Ministry of Fear, directed by Fritz Lang and starring Ray Milland.

The title is explained in the book. The Nazi regime, in countries it controlled and in those it intended to subvert, built up information on individuals in order to blackmail them into co-operation. This Greene called their ministry of fear.

Plot summary 

In London during the Blitz. Arthur Rowe attends a charity fête. Convicted of murder for the mercy killing of hs wife, he has just been released from a psychiatric prison. A fortune-teller tells him the answer to the ‘guess the weight of the cake’ competition, enabling Rowe to win it.  As he leaves, the organisers try to take the cake back, saying there’s been a mistake, but Rowe refuses.

The next day, a man offers Rowe money for the cake and then tries to poison him, but an air raid bomb demolishes the house, knocking them both out. Worried for himself and wary of the police, Rowe hires a private detective to watch him and goes to the charity that ran the fête. There he meets Willi and Anna Hilfe, Austrian refugees who are brother and sister. Willi goes with Rowe to the fortune-teller’s home. There they join in a séance, during which a man is murdered with Rowe’s knife. Rowe escapes before the police arrive.

Rowe contemplates suicide, but meets a man who asks him to take some books to a hotel. At the hotel he finds Anna and a bomb in the case explodes. When Rowe regains consciousness, he has amnesia. The nurses tell him his name is Richard Digby, but Anna visits and calls him ‘Arthur’. Rowe starts to fall in love with Anna.

Becoming convinced that the sanatorium is run by Nazi agents, Rowe escapes and goes to the police. The police tell him that the man who Rowe thought murdered isn’t dead, and the cake had a microfilm of secret plans hidden in it. They take him to a tailor’s shop where he identifies the man he thought dead. Before they can question the man, he kills himself.

After the police round up most of the spy ring, Rowe rings the telephone number that the tailor called before killing himself, and hears Anna's voice. He finds out the address and, going there, learns that Willi is a member of the spy ring.

Willi escapes, intending to reach neutral Eire with the microfilm sewn into his new suit, but when cornered by Rowe commits suicide. Rowe returns to Anna.

Passage:
Altbier
Altbier (German: old beer) is a style of beer brewed in the historical region of Westphalia and the city of Düsseldorf, Germany. Its name comes from it being top-fermented, an older method than the bottom fermentation of other lagered beers.

Characteristics 

Altbier is usually a dark copper colour. It is fermented at a moderate temperature using a top-fermenting yeast which gives its flavour some fruitiness, but matured at a cooler temperature, which gives it a cleaner and crisper taste more akin to lager beer styles than is the norm for top-fermented beers, such as British pale ale.  

Altbier in Germany 

Altbier is the dominant beer variety in the Lower Rhine region and especially in the towns of Düsseldorf, Krefeld and Mönchengladbach. The first producer to use the name Alt to contrast its top fermenting beer with the bottom fermenting kinds was the Schumacher brewery of Düsseldorf, which opened in 1838. 

The market leader in terms of volume sold is Diebels, a brand within the InBev brewing empire. Other mass-market brewers of Altbier include the Radeberger Gruppe under the brands Schlösser Alt and Hansa Alt. These are complemented by small breweries, predominantly based in Düsseldorf.

Some Altbier breweries have a tradition of producing a stronger version known as Sticke Alt, coming from a local dialect word meaning ""secret"", originally a special reserve beer intended for the brewers' own consumption. It is generally a seasonal or special occasion brew, and is stronger in taste and alcohol as well as darker than the brewery's standard output.

Producers in Düsseldorf 

There are eight bars in Düsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises:
* Füchschen 
* Kürzer 
* Schumacher 
* Schlüssel 
* Uerige 
* Alter Bahnhof (Gulasch Alt) 
* Brauhaus Joh Albrecht (Johann Albrecht Alt) 
* Brauerei Möhker

Füchschen, Uerige, Schlüssel and Kürzer are all brewed and sold in the Old Town (Altstadt). Schumacher is between the Altstadt and the main train station (Hauptbahnhof), although it also has a pub in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schlüssel.

Each brewpub produces a seasonal ""Sticke"" variant in small quantities, though the names vary: Schlüssel spells it ""Stike"", without the ""c"", while Schumacher calls its special beer ""Latzenbier"", meaning ""slat beer"", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves.  Füchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve. 

Producers outside Düsseldorf 

Altbier brewed outside Düsseldorf includes that produced by Pinkus Müller brewery in Münster, the Diebels brewery in Issum, the Gleumes brewery in Krefeld, the Bolten brewery in Korschenbroich and the Warsteiner brewery in Warstein, which owns the brand ""Frankenheim Alt"", which was originally brewed in Düsseldorf. The biggest Altbier brewery is located in Krefeld: Former Rhenania brewery, now called Königshofer brewery produces besides their self labelled Königshofer Alt a variety of different brands including the Carlsberg owned Hannen Alt and Gatzweiler Alt. Altbier is somewhat similar to Cologne's native beer style Kölsch, being warm-fermented at a lower temperature than British ales, and Altbier proper is also brewed in Cologne's smallest brewery ""Braustelle"" as ""Ehrenfelder Alt"". 

Outside Germany 

Altbier has been produced in the city of Venlo in the Netherlands since at least 1753. Venlo is on the border to Germany approximately 50 km (30 miles) from Düsseldorf. The beer was produced up until the Second World War but then had a hiatus until its revival in 1983. It is produced by the Lindeboom brewery, who bought the recipe in 2001.

Altbier is also brewed in small quantities in Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, the UK, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa.

In 2003, Drayman's Brewery in Pretoria, produced what was probably the first commercially available Altbier in South Africa, Düssel Altbier. 

Versions of Altbier are brewed in the United States, though not always to traditional recipes. Great Basin Brewing Company produces and bottles Wild Horse Ale, which is billed as an alt-style ale.  ""White Street Altbier"" from White Street Brewing Co. in Wake Forest, North Carolina, showcases German malts and hops in the classic style. ""Copper Alt"" from Olde Mecklenburg Brewery in Charlotte, North Carolina, is based on the original Düsseldorf Altbier style. Arbor Brewing Company of Michigan produces ""Olde Number 22"" altbier as a seasonal specialty. River's Edge Brewery in Milford, MI brews a traditional version called Ctrl+Alt+Del. Hops and Grain in Austin, Texas brews an altbier called Alt-eration.   Kansas City Bier Co in Kansas City, MO produce a seasonal beer called Doppel Alt—based on German brewing standards.  In Houston, Texas, 8th Wonder Brewery crafts an altbier year-round called Alternate Universe.  Union Craft Brewing Company out of Baltimore, Maryland brews ""Balt Altbier"".   Other American ales brewed in the Alt style include Double Bag Double Altbier (Long Trail Brewing Company), Alaskan Amber (Alaskan Brewing Company), Sly Fox Grand Opening Alt (Sly Fox Brewery) and Siren's Song (Düsseldorf Altbier) (Maui Brewing Company). Schell's Brewing in New Ulm, MN seasonally produces Schmaltz's Alt, which they classify as a Doppel Alt.

Kilannan Brewing Company near Owen Sound, Ontario has been brewing an Altbier since 2012. Kilannan also produces a traditional Kölsch. The Creemore Springs brewery in Ontario, Canada celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2012 by producing an Altbier in collaboration with the Schlüssel brewery of Düsseldorf.

Passage:
As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning
As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning (1969) is a memoir by Laurie Lee, a British poet. It is a sequel to Cider with Rosie which detailed his life in post First World War Gloucestershire. The author leaves the security of his Cotswold village in Gloucestershire to start a new life, at the same time embarking on an epic journey by foot.

It is 1934, and as a young man Lee walks to London from his Cotswolds home. He is to live by playing the violin and by labouring on a London building site. When this work draws to a finish, and having picked up the phrase in Spanish for 'Will you please give me a glass of water?', he decides to go to Spain. He scrapes together a living by playing his violin outside the street cafés, and sleeps at night in his blanket under an open sky or in cheap, rough posadas. For a year he tramps through Spain, from Vigo in the north to the south coast, where he is trapped by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.

Experiencing a Spain ranging from the utterly squalid to the utterly beautiful, Lee creates a story which evocatively captures the spirit and atmosphere of the towns and countryside he passes through in his own distinctive semi-poetic style. He is warmly welcomed by the Spaniards he meets and enjoys a generous hospitality even from the poorest villagers he encounters along the way.

Synopsis 

In 1934 Laurie Lee leaves his home in Gloucestershire for London.  He visits Southampton and it is here that he first tries his luck at playing his violin in the streets. His apprenticeship proves profitable and he decides to move eastwards. Lee makes his way along the south coast and then turns inland and heads north for London.  He meets up with his American girlfriend, Cleo, who is the daughter of an American anarchist.

Cleo's father finds him a job as a labourer and he is able to rent a room. However, he has to move on as his room is taken over by a prostitute. He lives in London for almost a year as part of a gang of wheelbarrow pushers. Once the building nears completion, he knows that his time is up and decides to go to Spain because he knows the phrase in Spanish for ""Will you please give me a glass of water?"".

He lands in Galicia in July 1935.  Joining up with a group of three young German musicians, he accompanies them around Vigo and then they split up outside Zamora.  By August 1935 Lee reaches Toledo, where he has a meeting with the South African poet Roy Campbell and his family, whom he comes across while playing his violin.  They invite him to stay in their house.

By the end of September Lee reaches the sea.  Then he comes to the Sierra Morena mountains.  He decides to turn west and follow the Guadalquivir, adding several months to his journey, and taking him to the sea in a roundabout way. Lee turns eastwards, heading along the bare coastal shelf of Andalusia. He hears talk of war in Abyssinia. He arrives at Tarifa, making another stop over in Algeciras.

He decides to stick to his plan to follow the coast round Spain, and sets off for Málaga, stopping in Gibraltar.  During his last days in Malaga his violin breaks. After his new line of work, acting as a guide to British tourists, is curtailed by local guides, he is fortunate to meet a young German who gives him a violin.

In the winter of 1935 Lee decides to stay in Almuñécar.  He manages to get work in a hotel. Lee and his friend Manolo, the hotel's waiter, drink in the local bar alongside the other villagers. Manolo is the leader of a group of fishermen and labourers and they discuss the expected revolution.

In February the Socialists win the election and a Popular Front begins.  In the spring, the villagers, in an act of revolt, burn down the church but then change their minds. In the middle of May, there is a strike and the peasants come in from the countryside to lend their support as the village splits between 'Fascists' and 'Communists'.

In the middle of July 1936 war breaks out.  Manolo helps organise a militia.  Granada is held by the rebels, and so is Almuñécar's neighbour Altofaro.  A British destroyer from Gibraltar arrives to pick up any British subjects who might be marooned on the coast and Lee is taken on board.

The epilogue describes Lee's return to his family home in Gloucestershire and his desire to help his comrades in Spain. He finally manages to make his way through France and crosses the Pyrenees into Spain.

Title 

An insight into the origin of the title of the book is found in the second episode the BBC Four documentary series Travellers' Century presented by Benedict Allen. In the episode, which looks at As I Walked Out..., a friend of Lee reveals that the title of the book comes from a Gloucestershire folk song. The traditional song ""The Banks of Sweet Primroses"" starts with the line 'As I walked out one mid-summer morning'.

Passage:
Toru Iwatani
is a former Japanese video game designer. He is best known as the creator of the arcade games Pac-Man (1980) and Pole Position (1982). 

Early life 

Iwatani was born in the Meguro ward of Tokyo, Japan. He joined the computer software company Namco in 1977.  This is where he started his career in the video game business.  There, he came up with the idea for a game called ""Pakku-Man"" and in 1980, he, along with programmer Shigeo Funaki (舟木 茂雄), a hardware engineer, a cabinet designer and Toshio Kai (甲斐 敏夫) for sound and music, finished the game. It was released to the Japanese public on May 22 of that year, where it became a huge success. It caught the attention of arcade-game manufacturer Midway, who bought the United States rights for the game and released the game in the U.S. as Pac-Man. Due to its innovative concept and continuing international popularity, it is regarded as one of the all-time classic video games. Iwatani returned to his Pac-Man roots in 2007 when he developed Pac-Man Championship Edition for the Xbox 360, which he states is the final game he will develop. 

Career

Iwatani went on to create a few other video games, including Libble Rabble, but none of them reached the amount of success that Pac-Man did. He was promoted within the ranks of Namco, eventually being responsible for overseeing the administration of the company. In a VH-1 Game Break interview, Iwatani said he did not personally profit from the creation of Pac-Man, saying, ""The truth of the matter is, there were no rewards per se for the success of Pac-Man.  I was just an employee.  There was no change in my salary, no bonus, no official citation of any kind.""  From April 2005 he taught the subject of Character Design Studies at Osaka University of Arts as visiting professor. Iwatani left Namco in March 2007 to become a full-time lecturer at Tokyo Polytechnic University. 

On June 2, 2010 just before visiting an event called the Festival of Games in the Netherlands, Iwatani was photographed showing the original sketches of Pac-Man, making it the first public appearance of these designs.  

The next day, June 3, 2010, at the Festival of Games, Iwatani received a certificate from Guinness World Records for Pac-Man having the most ""coin-operated arcade machines"" installed world wide: 293,822. The record was set and recognized in 2005, and recorded in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008. 

Iwatani made a cameo appearance in the film Pixels, which prominently features Pac-Man as an antagonist. A fictionalized version of Iwatani, portrayed by Denis Akiyama, also appears in the film.

Passage:
Haemophilia B
Haemophilia B (or hemophilia B) is a blood clotting disorder caused by a mutation of the factor IX gene, leading to a deficiency of factor IX. It is the second-most common form of haemophilia, rarer than haemophilia A. Haemophilia B was first recognized as a different kind of haemophilia in 1952.  It is sometimes called Christmas disease, named after Stephen Christmas, the first patient described with this disease.   In addition, the first report of its identification was published in the Christmas edition of the British Medical Journal. 

Signs/symptoms

The condition is marked by increased clotting time(3-8 minutes) and bleeding time(2-5 minutes).

Genetics

The factor IX gene is located on the X chromosome (Xq27.1-q27.2). It is an X-linked recessive trait, which explains why, as in haemophilia A, usually only males are affected. One in 20,000–30,000 males are affected.

In 1990, George Brownlee and Merlin Crossley showed that two sets of genetic mutations were preventing two key proteins from attaching to the DNA of people with a rare and unusual form of haemophilia B – haemophilia B Leyden – where sufferers experience episodes of excessive bleeding in childhood but have few bleeding problems after puberty. 
This lack of protein attachment to the DNA was thereby turning off the gene that produces clotting factor IX, which prevents excessive bleeding. In 2013, Merlin Crossley discovered the third and final protein causing haemophilia B Leyden.

Pathophysiology

Factor IX deficiency leads to an increased propensity for haemorrhage. This is in response to mild trauma or even spontaneously, such as in joints (haemarthrosis) or muscles.

Diagnosis

Treatment

Treatment (bleeding prophylaxis) is by intravenous infusion of factor IX. Factor IX has a longer half life than factor VIII (deficient in haemophilia A) and as such factor IX can be transfused less frequently.

History 

In the early years, there were not many treatment options for people with haemophilia B. By the late 1950s and the 1960s, with newfound technology and gradual advances in medicine, pharmaceutical scientists found a way to take the factor IX from fresh frozen plasma(FFP) and give it to those with haemophilia B. Though they found a way to treat the disease, the FFP contained only a small amount of factor IX, requiring large amounts of FFP to treat an actual bleeding episode, which resulted in the patients requiring hospitalization. By the mid-1960s scientists found a way to get a larger amount of factor IX from FFP.

By the late 1960s, pharmaceutical scientists found methods to separate the factor IX from plasma, which allows for neatly packaged bottles of factor IX concentrates. With the new development, doctors have a way to dose the amount of factor IX that patients need for bleed episodes. With the rise of factor IX concentrates it became easier for patients to get treatment at home.Although these advances in medicine had a significant positive impact on the treatment of haemophilia, there were many complications that came with it. By the early 1980s, scientists discovered that the medicines they had created were transferring blood-borne viruses, such as hepatitis, and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. With the rise of these deadly viruses, scientists had to find improved methods for screening the blood products they received from donors.

In 1982, scientists made a breakthrough in medicine and were able to clone factor IX gene. With this new development it decreased the risk of the many viruses. Although the new factor was created, it wasn't available for haemophilia B patients till 1997. 

European royal families

A study published in 2009 identified the blood disease affecting the royal families of Great Britain, Germany, Russia and Spain as haemophilia B on the basis of genetic markers.

A heptathlon is a track and field combined events contest made up of seven events. The name derives from the Greek hepta (seven) and athlon (contest) There are two heptathlons – the women's and the men's. The men's is older and is held indoors, while theWomen's is held outdoors and was introduced in the 1980s, first appearing in the Olympics in 1984. Jessica Ennis-Hill, representing Great Britain, is the 2012 Olympic Gold Medallist and the current World Champion. Heptathlon scoring system was devised by Dr Karl Ulbrich, a Viennese mathematician. Each event also has a minimum recordable performance level (e.g. 0.75 m for the high jump), corresponding to zero points. The athlete accumulating the highest number of points wins the competition. The IAAF World Combined Events Challenge determines a yearly women'sHeptathlon champion. The scoring is similar for both versions, for his/her performance in each event according to scoring tables. In each event the athlete scores points according to the scoring tables according to. the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) The athlete with the most points at the end of each event wins the event. The winner of the event is declared the winner of that year's IAAF Heptathlete of the Year competition, which is held every year. The event is contested at the Olympic level in the Summer Olympics and in the World Championships in Athletics. There is also a Tetradecathlon, consisting of 14 events, seven events per day, normally contested by men only. There are different values for each of the events (see table) for points, time in seconds, length in centimeters and length in meters. The events are split into three groups, and the scores are calculated according. to the three formulae: running events (200 m, 800 m and 100 m hurdles), high jump and long jump, javelin throw and 800 m. The scores are Calculated according to:  P = a \cdot (b - T)^c (M - b)u (C - c) (A - D) (G - G) (H - H) (J - J) (K - K) (L - L) (C) (B) (M) (D) (R) (S) (P) (T) (U) (W) (Z) (E) (F) (g) (h) (b) (r) (m) (s) (c) (e) (f) (w) (a) (t) (z) (i) (u) (j) (l) (p) (d) (x) (k) (n) (1) (2) (3) (4) The city of Venice sets official rates for gondola rides, which started at €80 for 40 minutes the last time we checked. After 7 p.m., the base rate climbs to €100, with €50 for an additional 20 minutes. Up to six people can share a gondolas. A gondolier's living costs may be higher than yours, since Venice is an expensive city in one of Italy's wealthiest provinces. The city of Matola is the largest suburb of the Mozambique capital, Maputo, and adjacent to the west of the Grand Canal. It is also the most populated place in the province of Moambique, with a population of 893,000, according to the 2007 census, having increased to a projected 6,422 inhabitants in 2014 (Instituto Nacional de Estatistica) Matola also has its own elected municipal government since 1998 and has a biggest industrial port and port and also the biggest port and industrial area in Mozambiques. The population of the Matola area is 675,000 and it is the most densely populated area of the province, with an estimated 8,000 inhabitants in the capital, Matola, which also has a port and the biggest industrial town in the country, Carnevale. It's also the second-largest city in the Italian region of Lazio, after Venice, and one of the most beautiful cities in the world, with views of the Alps and the Adriatic Sea to the north and the Alps to the south. In Venice, the city is known for its nightlife, with many bars, restaurants, bars and clubs, and a lively nightlife scene. It also is a popular tourist destination, especially in the summer, when many people go to Venice to take advantage of the city's nightlife and nightlife. In the winter, Venice is the only city in Italy where it's possible to take a boat ride in the evenings and into the early hours of the morning. It can be a delightful experience, but only if you're able to forget the price and focus on the ride. The best way to get around Venice is by walking or by renting a car, which is cheaper and more convenient than taking a train or a bus. It takes about an hour and a half to travel from Venice to the island of Capri in the north to the southern tip of the island, where the Grand Canyon is located. The journey takes about three hours. It starts and ends with a stop at the town's main train station, where you can buy a ticket for a ride to the city center. The Kwanzaa holiday was created in 1966 by Dr. Maulana Karenga as a way for African-Americans to honor their shared heritage and culture. This year's theme is ""Us and the Well-being of the World: A Courageous Questioning"" The 36th annual Kwanzea Gwaride Parade and Festival will be the largest KwanZa kickoff celebration in Southern California. The Kwanza Heritage Festival will also be held in Leimert Park on December 29 and will include live music, traditional dancing, a drum circle and an international marketplace. The seven-day celebration begins today, December 26, and goes until January 1. The holiday's template is loosely based on traditional pan-African harvest festivals. It encourages unity among those of African descent and attempts to preserve common African culture. It is a non-religious, non-heroic,non-political African-American holiday. It has some epic roots in our own backyard. It was originally written about when I was the Managing Editor of City Beat Long Beach and a version of this piece originally appeared in the December 2011 issue of that magazine. Since City Beat is no more and their website has been taken down as well, I received permission to re-run this relevant piece on this important holiday that has someEpic roots in the U.S. It's a unique experience that encourages unity and preservation of African culture and heritage. It also calls on us to sit down, think deeply about ourselves in the world, and measure ourselves in. the mirror of the best of our culture to determine where we stand. It can be found at: http://www.csuulb.edu/news/features/kwanzas-celebrations-and-activities-in-long-beach-california-january-1-12-13-14-15-20-20. The event is free and open to the public.

It is the second posthumous release of Lennon's music, having been recorded during the sessions from his albums Walls and Bridges and Rock 'n' Roll. The title refers to Lennon's childhood home, 251 Menlove Avenue, in Liverpool. It was released under the supervision of Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow. It failed to chart in the United Kingdom, though it did manage to reach number 127 in the U.S., making it Lennon's least-successful album. The album cover was effected by artist Andy Warhol, just months before Lennon's death in 1980. The song ""Here We Go Again"" was included on the 2006 soundtrack album The U.s. vs. John Lennon and 2010 box set Gimme Some Truth. The first side of the LP comprises session outtakes from the Rock'n' Roll sessions with Phil Spector in late 1973. The remainder features rehearsal recordings in mid-1974 for Walls andridges. The track listing is as follows:Side one: ""To Know Her Is to Love"" (Lennon / Spector) – 4:50#""Rock and Roll People"" 4:21#""Angel Baby Left Me"" (Rosie Hamlin) – 3:42#""Since My Baby Left me"" (Arthur Crudup) 4:37#""Old Dirt Road"" (Harry Nilsson / Harry Nilsson) 3:17#""Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out)"" 4:11#""Scared"" and ""Glass and Glass"" (Phil Spector and Rosemary Clooney) – 2:45#""Here We go Again"" (John Lennon / Phil Spectors) – 5:00#""When You’re Down and out"" (Rosemary Clooneys) – 6:15#""To Know her Is To Love"" – 4.20# ""Old dirt road"" – 6.30# ""Young Guns"" – 7:30#""Young Guns,"" 7:40# ""Rock and roll"" – 8:30 # ""Young Girls"" – 9:00 # ""Rock & Roll"" – 10:00 / ""Young Women"" – 11:00 (John and Rosemarie) – ""Young Men"" – 12:00/ ""Young Boys"" – 13:30/ ""Old Girls"" - 12:30 / ""Old Men"" - 13:00. The Ministry of Fear is a 1943 novel written by Graham Greene. It was first published in Britain by William Heinemann. The title is explained in the book. The Nazi regime, in countries it controlled and in those it intended to subvert, built up information on individuals in order to blackmail them into co-operation. This Greene called their ministry of fear. The album Menlove Ave, released posthumously in 1986, is by which musician?Answer:John Winston Ono Lennon, MBE. The book was made into the 1944 film Ministry of fear, directed by Fritz Lang and starring Ray Milland. The film was based on the 1943 novel by Greene. The novel was also made into a 1944 film, The Ministry Of Fear, starring Fritz Lang. The movie was also based on a 1943 book by Greene, and the film was also set in 1944, the year after the Second World War. The German beer Altbier (German: old beer) is a style of beer brewed in the historical region of Westphalia and the city of Düsseldorf, Germany. Its name comes from it being top-fermented, an older method than the bottom fermentation of other lagered beers. The first producer to use its name to contrast its top fermenting beer with the bottom fermenting was Schumacher, which was the first brewery to use the name in the region. The beer is usually a dark copper colour and is fermented at a moderate temperature using a topmenting yeast which gives its flavour some fruitiness, but matured at a cooler temperature, which gives it a taste more akin to lager styles than is the norm for other styles. The song is by Phil Spector - producer (tracks 1, 3-5) and was recorded in late 1973. Track 2 is recorded for, but left off, Mind Games. Tracks 6-10 are rehearsal recordings for Walls and Bridges in mid-1974. Track 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 34 and 33, 32. Track 4 is recorded in 1973 and is called 'Bless You' – 4:29. Track 5 is from the album 'Walls and Bridges' - 4:05. The market leader in terms of volume sold is Diebels, a brand within the InBev brewing empire. Altbier is also brewed in small quantities in Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, the UK, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa. The beer has been produced in the city of Venlo in the Netherlands since at least 1753. In 2003, Drayman's Brewery in Pretoria, produced what was probably the first commercially available Altbiers in South Africa, Düssel Alt bier. The German version of the beer is known as Altbierer (Altbier beer) and is produced by the Radeberger Gruppe under the brands Schlösser Alt and Hansa Alt. It is brewed in the Old Town (Altstadt) and Uerige in the Alter Bahnhof (Gulasch Alt) area of DüSseldorf. There are eight brewpubs in the Altstadt, including Füchschen, Schumacher and Brauerei Möhker. Some breweries produce a stronger version known as Sticke Alt, coming from a local dialect word meaning ""secret"" It is generally a seasonal or special occasion brew, and is stronger in taste and alcohol as well as darker than the brewery's standard output. In the U.S. Great Basin Brewing Company produces and bottles Wild Horse Ale, which is billed as an altbier ale. White Street Brewing Company in Wake Forest, North Carolina, showcases a traditional German-style version called altbiers from Olde Mecklenburg Brewery in North Carolina. Königshofer brewery in Austin, Texas, produces a traditional version called Alt-Del+Del Grain Hops and an alt-bier called Alt+Del+Grain Hops in Kansas City, Kansas. In Milford, Michigan, River Edge Brewery in Milford produces a seasonal Altbiere called ""Olde Number 22"" and a number of other altbiere styles. The Altbieri brand is owned by Carlsberg, which also owns Hannen Alt and Gatzweiler Alt. In Austria, the beer was produced up until the Second World War but then had a hiatus until its revival in 1983. It was produced by Lindeboom brewery, who bought the recipe in 2001. It's produced by Pinkus Müller brewery in Münster, the Diebel brewery in Issum, the Bolten brewery in Korschenbroich and the Warsteiner brewery in Warstein, which owns the brand ""Frankenheim Alt"" Spencer Kelly is the presenter of the BBC's technology programme Click.

The author of As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning (1969) is a British poet. He leaves the security of his Cotswold village in Gloucestershire to start a new life, at the same time embarking on an epic journey by foot. For a year he tramps through Spain, from Vigo in the north to the south coast, where he is trapped by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. He scrapes together a living by playing his violin outside the street cafés, and sleeps at night in his blanket under an open sky or in cheap, rough posadas. The book is a sequel to Cider with Rosie which detailed his life in post First World War Gloucesterhire. It is a story which evocatively captures the spirit and atmosphere of the towns and countryside he passes through in his own distinctive semi-poetic style. He meets and enjoys a generous hospitality from the poorest villagers even from the warmly warmly welcomed villagers he encounters. He ends up in the town of Vigo, which he describes as 'utterly squalid and utterly squalid' The author also describes the atmosphere of Spain as ‘utterly beautiful’ and ‘totally squalid’ The author’s story is based on the book by Laurie Lee, which is published by Chatto & Windus and costs £16.99.

Toru Iwatani came up with the idea for a game called ""Pakku-Man"" in 1980. In 1980, he, along with programmer Shigeo Funaki, a cabinet designer and Toshio Kai, finished the game. It was released to the Japanese public on May 22 of that year, where it became a huge success. It caught the attention of arcade-game manufacturer Midway, who bought the United States rights for the game and released the game in the U.S. as Pac-Man. Due to its innovative concept and continuing international popularity, it is regarded as one of the all-time classic video games. In a VH-1 Game Break interview, he said he did not personally profit from the creation of Pac- man, saying, ""The truth of the matter is, there were no rewards per se for the success ofPac-Man."" He left Namco in March 2007 to become a full-time lecturer at Tokyo Polytechnic University. He made a cameo appearance in the film Pixels, which prominently features Pac-man as an antagonist. A fictionalized version of Iwatni, portrayed by Denis Akiyama, also appears in the movie. In 2013, Merll Merl, the creator of the game, said that he will never make another video game. He said that the story of a pizza missing a slice being the inspiration of the main character was only half true. In 2005, he was photographed showing the original sketches of the character, making it the first public appearance of these designs. In 2010, he received a certificate from Guinness World Records for Pac- Man having the most ""coin-operated arcade machines"" installed world wide: 293,822. In April 2005 he taught the subject of Character Design Studies at Osaka University of Arts as visiting professor. In March 2007 he became a full time lecturer at the university. He says he will not develop any more games for the Xbox 360, which he states is the final game he will develop. He also has a rare form of haemophilia B – Leyden – where sufferers experience episodes of excessive bleeding in childhood but have few episodes of bleeding after puberty. The condition is marked by increased clotting time(3-8 minutes) and bleeding time(2-5 minutes). In 1990, George Brownlee and Merlin Crossley showed that two sets of mutations were preventing proteins from attaching to DNA of males. Factor IX deficiency leads to an increased propensity for haemorrhage. This is in response to mild trauma or even spontaneously, such as in joints (haemarthrosis) or muscles. Treatment (bleeding prophylaxis) is by intravenous infusion of factor IX. Factor IX has a longer half life than factor VIII (deficient in haemophilia A) and as such factor IX can be transfused less frequently. In 1982, scientists made a breakthrough in medicine and were able to clone the factor IX gene. With this new development it decreased the risk of the many viruses. Although the new factor was created, it wasn't available for ha Hemophilia B patients till 1997. A study published in 2009 identified the blood disease affecting the royal families of Great Britain, Germany, Russia and Spain as haemphilia B on the basis of genetic markers. In 2009, the European Royal Family was diagnosed with the disease. In 2012, the disease was also identified in the U.S. and Canada. It is the fourth most common blood disorder in the United States, after diabetes, heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The most common form of the disease is the blood clotting disorder hemophilia, which is the most common type of blood disorder. It affects about 1 in 10,000 people in the US and 1 in 20,000 in the UK."

Fingal's Cave
Fingal's Cave is a sea cave on the uninhabited island of Staffa, in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, known for its natural acoustics. The National Trust for Scotland owns the cave as part of a National Nature Reserve.  It became known as Fingal's Cave after the eponymous hero of an epic poem by 18th-century Scots poet-historian James Macpherson.

Formation 

Fingal's Cave is formed entirely from hexagonally jointed basalt columns within a Paleocene lava flow,  similar in structure to the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland and those of nearby Ulva.

In all these cases, cooling on the upper and lower surfaces of the solidified lava resulted in contraction and fracturing, starting in a blocky tetragonal pattern and transitioning to a regular hexagonal fracture pattern with fractures perpendicular to the cooling surfaces.  As cooling continued these cracks gradually extended toward the centre of the flow, forming the long hexagonal columns we see in the wave-eroded cross-section today.  Similar hexagonal fracture patterns are found in desiccation cracks in mud where contraction is due to loss of water instead of cooling. 

Acoustics 

The cave's size and naturally arched roof,  and the eerie sounds produced by the echoes of waves, give it the atmosphere of a natural cathedral. The cave's Gaelic name, An Uaimh Bhinn, means ""the melodious cave.""

History 

Little is known of the early history of Staffa, although the Swiss town of Stäfa on Lake Zurich was named after the island by a monk from nearby Iona. Part of the Ulva estate of the Clan MacQuarrie from an early date until 1777,Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 124 the cave was brought to the attention of the English-speaking world by 18th-century naturalist Sir Joseph Banks in 1772.  

It became known as Fingal's Cave after the eponymous hero of an epic poem by 18th century Scots poet-historian James Macpherson. It formed part of his Ossian cycle of poems claimed to have been based on old Scottish Gaelic poems. In Irish mythology, the hero Fingal is known as Fionn mac Cumhaill, and it is suggested that Macpherson rendered the name as Fingal (meaning ""white stranger"" ) through a misapprehension of the name which in old Gaelic would appear as Finn.  The legend of the Giant's Causeway has Fionn or Finn building the causeway between Ireland and Scotland.[http://giantcrystals.strahlen.org/europe/basalt.htm Formation of basalt columns / pseudocrystals]

Sightseeing 

The cave has a large arched entrance and is filled by the sea. Several sightseeing cruises organised from April to September by local companies pass the entrance to the cave. It is also possible to land elsewhere on the island (as some of these cruises permit) and walk overland to the cave, where a row of fractured columns forms a walkway just above high-water level permitting exploration on foot. From the inside, the entrance seems to frame the island of Iona across the water.

In art and literature 

Romantic composer Felix Mendelssohn visited in 1829 and wrote an overture, The Hebrides, Op. 26, (also known as Fingal's Cave overture), inspired by the weird echoes in the cave.  Mendelssohn's overture popularized the cave as a tourist destination. Other famous 19th-century visitors included author Jules Verne, who used it in his book Le Rayon vert (The Green Ray), and mentions it in the novels Journey to the Center of the Earth and The Mysterious Island; poets William Wordsworth, John Keats, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson; and Romantic artist J. M. W. Turner, who painted ""Staffa, Fingal's Cave"" in 1832.  Queen Victoria also made the trip.

The playwright August Strindberg also set scenes from his play A Dream Play in a place called ""Fingal's Grotto"". Scots novelist Sir Walter Scott described Fingal's Cave as ""one of the most extraordinary places I ever beheld. It exceeded, in my mind, every description I had heard of it... composed entirely of basaltic pillars as high as the roof of a cathedral, and running deep into the rock, eternally swept by a deep and swelling sea, and paved, as it were, with ruddy marble, [it] baffles all description."" 

Artist Matthew Barney used the cave along with the Giant's Causeway for the opening and closing scenes of his art film, Cremaster 3. In 2008, the video artist Richard Ashrowan spent several days recording the interior of Fingal's Cave for an exhibition at the Foksal Gallery in Poland.

One of Pink Floyd's early songs bears this location's name. This instrumental was written for the film Zabriskie Point but not used. 

Lloyd House at Caltech has a mural representing Fingal's Cave.  The hallway that features this mural also houses a wooden statue named Fingal, which is among the oldest heirlooms at the institute.

Scottish Celtic rock band Wolfstone recorded an instrumental titled ""Fingal's Cave"" on their 1999 album Seven.

Passage:
La donna è mobile
"""" (The woman is fickle) is the Duke of Mantua's canzone from the beginning of act 3 of Giuseppe Verdi's opera Rigoletto (1851). The canzone is famous as a showcase for tenors. Raffaele Mirate's performance of the bravura aria at the opera's 1851 premiere was hailed as the highlight of the evening. Before the opera's first public performance (in Venice), the song was rehearsed under tight secrecy:  a necessary precaution, as """" proved to be incredibly catchy, and soon after the song's first public performance, every gondolier in Venice was singing it.

As the opera progresses, the reprise of the tune in the following scenes exemplifies a sense of confusion, as Rigoletto realizes that from the sound of the Duke's lively voice coming from within the tavern (offstage), the body in the sack over which he had grimly triumphed, was not that of the Duke after all: Rigoletto had paid Sparafucile, an assassin, to kill the Duke, but Sparafucile had deceived Rigoletto by indiscriminately killing Gilda, Rigoletto's beloved daughter, instead. The song is an irony, as no character in the opera presents traits associated with rationality; every character may be considered callous and ' (""inconstant"").

The music

The almost comical-sounding theme of """" is introduced immediately, and runs as illustrated (transposed from the original key of B major). The theme is repeated several times in the approximately two to three minutes it takes to perform the aria, but with the important—and obvious—omission of the last bar. This has the effect of driving the music forward as it creates the impression of being incomplete and unresolved, which it is, ending not on the tonic or dominant but on the submediant. Once the Duke has finished singing, however, the theme is once again repeated; but this time it includes the last, and conclusive, bar and finally resolving to the tonic. The song is strophic in form with an orchestral ritornello.

Audi and Volvo - Latin origin of the car company names - High Names
03.20.13 Posted in Naming blog by christa
Let’s get back to the car business. We know a lot of the car companies are named after their founders – the trend was spread worldwide from the earliest electric automobiles. These include Ford (after Henry Ford), Peugeot (after the Peugeot family), also later Bentley (after Walter Owen Bentley), Porsche (after Ferdinand Porsche). The trend is also present in Asia by car manufacturers like Toyota (after Kiichiro Toyoda) and Honda (after Soichiro Honda).
However, there are still original company names between the world-wide known brands in the car industry. The naming strategy is often so unique that they cannot be put in categories. But Audi and Volvo can. Can you guess what the connection between those two famous car companies is in terms of naming? Latin.
Volvo – on the different car company names
Despite that Volvo is a Swedish company the founders didn’t name the car Viking or Nordic or anything like that. They decided on the Latin word volvere, meaning to roll. It seems a logical word choice since the purpose of working on a Swedish car project was to build cars that could withstand the cold Scandinavian weather and uneven roads – basically a car that rolls. What they did is only conjugate the verb volvere in first person (because unlike in English many other languages use similar but still different words when saying I roll, you roll, etc) and voilà – you have Volvo. It’s like the car speaks to you – I roll.
Audi – on the translated car company names
The reason for naming the famous car company Audi isn’t that spontaneous compared to Volvo. The truth is that the founder August Horch (and no the AU in Audi doesn’t come from the first two letters of the founder’s name) had originally founded another car company named August Horch & Co. This happened in 1904 when the German engineer had quit working for Karl Benz. However, after some problems in the company, in 1909 Horch founded a second company – but his family name could not be used again as a name for the company because he didn’t have the rights on the company name. The story says that one of his business partners’ son came up with the name Audi. But this wasn’t a random Latin word that simply starts with the letter A (as you may know by now from our blog posts having a company name that starts with A is great because you get listed early in alphabetically ordered lists). If you speak German you’ll know that horch comes from the infinitive form of horchen and actually has a meaning – to listen (carefully). Now, can you guess what the Latin translation of horchen is? It’s audire – a verb that when conjugated in the same form as horch, becomes audi. The name seemed logical since August Horch could no longer use his own name. And a little more than 100 years later Audi is still one of the most popular names in the car industry.

About the Movie
Based on the Holy Scriptures, with additional dialogue by several other hands, The Ten Commandments was the last film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. The story relates the life of Moses, from the time he was discovered in the bullrushes as an infant by the pharoah's daughter, to his long, hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses (Charlton Heston) starts out ""in solid"" as Pharoah's adopted son (and a whiz at designing pyramids, dispensing such construction-site advice as ""Blood makes poor mortar""), but when he discovers his true Hebrew heritage, he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses (Yul Brynner), Moses returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court, warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea, they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later, Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai, who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile, the Hebrews, led by the duplicitous Dathan (Edward G. Robinson), are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines. ""Where's your Moses now?"" brays Dathan in the manner of a Lower East Side gangster. He soon finds out. A remake of his 1923 silent film, DeMille's The Ten Commandments may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted, but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. It is very likely the most eventful 219 minutes ever recorded to filmand who's to say that Nefertiri (Anne Baxter) didn't make speeches like, ""Oh, Moses, Moses, you splendid, stubborn, adorable fool""?

Mo Farah smashes British and European 10,000 metres records at Prefontaine Classic

On what could well prove a watershed night for British male endurance running, the Somali-born Londoner produced the greatest performance of his life at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon, to smash the British and European 10,000 metres records.
Biding his time at the back of a truly world-class field before hitting the front with 2½ laps remaining, Farah blew away his opponents to cross the line in 26min 46.57sec — comfortably inside the previous 11-year-old European record of 26-52.30 held by Belgium’s Mohammed Mourhit and obliterating Jon Brown’s 1998 British mark of 27-18.14.
His time also took him to the top of this year’s world rankings, not to mention 14th on the world all-time list, and served notice that after his 5,000-10,000m double at last summer’s European Championships in Barcelona, he is now ready to challenge for silverware at world and Olympic level.
To put his performance into context, Farah was more than 14 seconds inside the Olympic record set by Ethiopia’s Kenenisa Bekele when he won the 10,000m gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
It was also vindication of his decision to move his family out to America three months ago to join Salazar’s 'Oregon Project’ in search of the extra seconds that would make him competitive at this summer’s World Championships in South Korea and, more importantly, in his home city next year.

The American coach is renowned for his attention to detail and his willingness to deploy innovative training methods. Farah’s new regime has included long sessions pounding away on an underwater treadmill to increase his strength while minimising the risk of injury.
Farah, 28, who lowered his 10,000m lifetime best by more than 42 seconds, has yet to lose a race since making the switch, having retained his European indoor 3,000m title and scored resounding victories in the New York Half Marathon and last week’s BUPA London 10,000.
Before the Eugene meeting, the fourth leg of the Diamond League series, Farah had declared his intention to challenge the British record.
But, having followed Salazar’s instructions to stay out of trouble and conserve his energy in the first half of the race, he turned his attention to the European mark in the final stages after hearing cries from the trackside that the record was within reach. He duly wound up the pace and covered the last kilometre in 2min 30.72sec.
“I just sat at the back and worked my way through the field,” he said. “I want to thank my coach, who has worked me really hard on the Oregon Project. It’s paid off.”
He added: “If it wasn’t for the crowd I would never have done this. With three laps to go I knew I had the chance for the record.”
Just as impressive as his winning time was the manner in which he outclassed a field loaded with East African talent, including Ethiopian Imane Merga, currently one of the best distance runners in the world and winner of last year’s overall Diamond League 5,000m title.
Like Farah, Merga produced a lifetime best but still finished two seconds behind the Briton, who also claimed the scalps of world silver medallist Zersenay Tadese, who was fifth, and Olympic silver medallist Sileshi Sihine, who was sixth.
Of the 20 athletes who finished the race, 14 set personal bests and nine went under the 27-minute barrier.
Having broken David Moorcroft’s 28-year-old 5,000m record last year, Farah can now claim to be the greatest male distance runner ever to run in a British vest, though he insists he will not be satisfied until he has won a medal on the global stage. That ambition now looks highly achievable.
Ian Stewart, who won the Olympic 5,000m bronze in 1972 and is now UK Athletics’ head of endurance, hailed Farah’s performance as a major breakthrough.
“That run from Mo was quite extraordinary and puts him firmly in the mix with the world’s best athletes,” he said. “This result absolutely shows that British distance runners can take on and beat the best in the world.”
Justin Gatlin finished sixth in a blistering 100 metres at the Diamond League meeting in Eugene tonight.
Gatlin, who is returning from a drugs ban, broke the 10 second barrier with a time of 9.97, but finished well adrift of Jamaica's Steve Mullings who won in a time of 9.80.
Six of the eight runners finished in under 10 seconds as the wind helped in Oregon.
The wind also helped Britain's Greg Rutherford to win the long jump in 8.32m, 2cm further than his record from the 2009 World Championships, but the conditions meant it will not stand as a British record.
South Africa's Caster Semenya made her Diamond League debut in the 800m, but could only manage second place behind Kenia Sinclair.
American Tyson Gay sent a message to Usain Bolt and his other 100m rivals by clocking a scorching 9.79sec at a low-key meeting in Clermont, Florida, to leap to top of the world rankings.
Jamaican sprinter Steve Mullings also threw down the gauntlet with a winning time of 9.80sec at the Prefontaine Classic. Bolt has managed just 9.91sec in his two 100m races so far this year.

More paintings in this room
Constable's painting is based on a site in Suffolk, near Flatford on the River Stour. The hay wain, a type of horse-drawn cart, stands in the water in the foreground . Across the meadow in the distance on the right, is a group of haymakers at work. The cottage shown on the left was rented by a farmer called Willy Lott and stands behind Flatford Mill. Today, the cottage and river path are still much as they were in Constable's time.
Although the painting evokes a Suffolk scene, it was created in the artist's studio in London. Constable first made a number of open-air sketches of parts of the scene. He then made a full-size preparatory sketch in oil to establish the composition .
The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821, the year it was painted, but failed to find a buyer. Yet when exhibited in France, with other paintings by Constable, the artist was awarded a Gold Medal by Charles X.

Benjamin Briggs
Benjamin Spooner Briggs (April 24, 1835 – probably November 1872) was an experienced United States seaman and master mariner. He is famous today for being the Captain of the merchant ship Mary Celeste when she was discovered unmanned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean near the Straits of Gibraltar, on December 4, 1872. The lifeboat was missing, yet the Mary Celeste herself was still under sail and there were signs of a sudden and unexplained abandonment. Benjamin Briggs, his wife Sarah and two-year-old daughter Sophia Matilda, along with the crew of the Mary Celeste, and the lifeboat, were never found and presumed lost.

Maritime career

The Briggs family of Massachusetts had a long maritime connection, and Benjamin Briggs himself spent most of his life at sea. He was an experienced, hardy and able seaman. He reportedly was respected by those who served under him because of his fairness and ability. He worked his way to eventually become a master mariner. Briggs captained the brigantine Sea Foam, and in 1862 became master of the three-masted schooner Forest King. When he took command of the bark Arthur in 1865, he turned over command of the Forest King to his brother, Oliver Briggs. Oliver Briggs was a frequent business partner and sailor with his brother.

Family

Benjamin Briggs was devoutly religious and a believer in abstinence. In 1862, he married Sarah Elizabeth Cobb, daughter of the Reverend Leander Cobb. The newlyweds sailed to Europe in Benjamin's  schooner Forest King. Their son, Arthur S. Briggs, was born in 1865 at the family home at Rose Cottage, Marion, Massachusetts. The following year, the family travelled to Marseilles, France, returning in time for their daughter, Sophia Matilda Briggs, to be born on October 31, 1870 at Rose Cottage.

Mary Celeste

In 1871 Briggs and his brother considered giving up the sea and buying a hardware store in New Bedford. In 1872, however, Benjamin Briggs bought a share in the brigantine Mary Celeste, owned by James Winchester, and made modifications to the cabin to house his family. In late 1872, two-year-old Sophia and his wife Sarah accompanied him on the ill fated voyage from Staten Island, New York, to Genoa, Italy. Their son Arthur stayed with his grandmother at Rose Cottage, Marion, Massachusetts, to attend school.

The following month Briggs' ship was found inexplicably abandoned in the Atlantic Ocean near the Straits of Gibraltar. Briggs, his wife and daughter, and the crew of the Mary Celeste were never found. Their fate remains a mystery.

Legacy

Benjamin Spooner Briggs has living descendants through his son Arthur who was left at home with his grandmother, including Benjamin Yarbrough Briggs, of Boston, Massachusetts and New York City, and John Briggs, of Boston, Massachusetts.  

A cenotaph memorializing the family stands in Evergreen Cemetery, Marion, Massachusetts. The inscription reads: ""Capt. Benj S. Briggs born Apr 24, 1835, Sarah E Cobb his wife born Apr 20 1841, Sophia M, their daughter, then 10 mos, born Oct 31, 1870. Lost in Brig Mary Celeste Nov 1872""  

Benjamin Spooner Briggs is the main protagonist in the game Limbo of the Lost, in which Briggs must solve puzzles to escape Limbo.

The Yves Saint Laurent advert which appeared in ‘Elle UK’ magazine; one reader complained that it was ‘irresponsible PA
An Yves Saint Laurent ad has been banned for featuring a model with a visible rib cage and knees and thighs of a similar width.
The ad, which appeared in Elle UK magazine, featured a black-and-white photo of a woman described by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) as “unhealthily underweight”, wearing a short black dress and high heels and lying on the floor with her eyes closed.
A reader complained that the ad was irresponsible for using a model who appeared to be unhealthily thin.
The ASA said YSL “indicated that they did not agree with the complainant’s view that the model was unhealthily thin” but did not provide a detailed response. Elle UK told the watchdog it had no comment.
The ASA said the model’s pose and the lighting drew particular focus to her chest, where her rib cage was visible and appeared prominent, and to her legs, where her thighs and knees appeared a similar width.

Passage:
Cynology
Cynology is the study of matters related to canines or domestic dogs and regular dogs.

In English it may be a term sometimes used to denote serious zoological approach to the study of dogs  as well as by writers on canine subjects, dog breeders and trainers   and enthusiasts who informally study the dog.  

Cynology 

Cynology is a classical compound word (from Greek , kyōn, genitive , kynos, ""dog""; and , -logia) referring to the study of dogs.  The word is not found in major English dictionaries and it is not a recognized scientific discipline in English-speaking countries.
Similar words are found in other languages, such German and Dutch kynologie, and the Russian кинология, from the Proto-Indo-European , which is the source of hound.

κυν is also the source of the English word cynic, and is directly related to canine and hound.

Usage in English 

The suffix '-logy' in English words refers to a study, or an academic discipline, or field of scientific study.  English Classical compound words of this type may confer an impression of scientific rigor on a non-scientific occupation or profession.

Usage in English of the word cynology is rare, and occasionally found in the names of dog training academies, with cynologist sometimes being used as a title by some dog trainers or handlers. People who informally study the dog may refer to themselves as 'cynologists' to imply serious study or scientific work.

The study of dogs 

Studies of dogs, and dog related matters, are carried out and published: in general, by those who have mastered the relevant literature or aspects of it, and the formal structure of the subject (National and International Kennel Club breeding, health, and show regulations etc.); in specific, by biologists, geneticists, zoologists, behaviourists, and others scientists, historians, veterinarians and breed specialists.

Informally, dogs may be studied by those with no specific scientific training, such as publicists and authors, breeders, trainers, police dog handlers, animal communicators and others, through literature, history,and personal experience. Many useful books and videotapes for the public have been produced through informal study of the dog.
Those who, very rarely, refer to themselves as ""cynologists"", may formally or informally study such things as veterinary science, dog breeding, breed development, dog behavior and training, and the literature and history of dogs.

Usage in other languages 

Cynology, may have other connotations or use in languages other than English, see German :de:Kynologie, Dutch :nl:Kynologie and Czech :cs:Sportovní kynologie.

The very rare term cynologist in English, is generally found to refer to ""canine specialists"" such as; certified care professionals, certified show judges, breeders, breed enthusiasts, certified dog-trainers and professional dog-handlers.

*A similar word is used to refer to dog handlers and dog trainers in Russia.  
*A veterinary clinic in Armenia offers a 'cynologist' to assist with dog training. 
*A magazine in the Baltic states described as 'dedicated to the development of cynology in the Baltic countries' covers dog training, dog shows, and veterinary advice (a hobbyist magazine, not a scientific journal.)
Question:
Cynology is the study of which animals?
Answer:
Domestic dogs

Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage in 1951, are put to death in the electric chair. The execution marked the dramatic finale of the most controversial espionage case of the Cold War.
Julius was arrested in July 1950, and Ethel in August of that same year, on the charge of conspiracy to commit espionage. Specifically, they were accused of heading a spy ring that passed top-secret information concerning the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union. The Rosenbergs vigorously protested their innocence, but after a brief trial in March 1951 they were convicted. On April 5, 1951, a judge sentenced them to death. The pair was taken to Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, New York, to await execution. During the next two years, the couple became the subject of both national and international debate. Many people believed that the Rosenbergs were the victims of a surge of hysterical anticommunist feeling in the United States, and protested that the death sentence handed down was cruel and unusual punishment. Most Americans, however, believed that the Rosenbergs had been dealt with justly. President Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke for many Americans when he issued a statement declining to invoke executive clemency for the pair. He stated, “I can only say that, by immeasurably increasing the chances of atomic war, the Rosenbergs may have condemned to death tens of millions of innocent people all over the world. The execution of two human beings is a grave matter. But even graver is the thought of the millions of dead whose deaths may be directly attributable to what these spies have done.”
Julius Rosenberg was the first to be executed, at about 8 p.m. on June 19, 1953. Just a few minutes after his body was removed from the chamber containing the electric chair, Ethel Rosenberg was led in and strapped to the chair. She was pronounced dead at 8:16 p.m. Both refused to admit any wrongdoing and proclaimed their innocence right up to the time of their deaths. Two sons, Michael and Robert, survived them.

Pipe Smoker of the Year
Pipe Smoker of the Year was an award given out annually by the British Pipesmokers' Council, to honour a famous pipe-smoking individual. Initiated in 1965 as Pipeman of the Year by the Briar Pipe Trade Association, it was presented at a lunch in London's Savoy Hotel each January. The award was discontinued in 2004 because its organisers feared it fell foul of laws banning all advertising and promotion of tobacco. 
The award was reintroduced in 2014, by the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs, at the British Pipe Smoking Championship at Newark Showground. In a departure from previous awards the recipient was not a celebrity, but the outgoing President of the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs Brian Mills, in recognition for his personal contribution in recommencing the British Pipe Smoking Championships.

About Drums - Nato Drum Lessons
About Drums
About Drums
Links
The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments, which is technically classified as the membranophones .  Drums consist of at least one membrane , called a drum head or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands or with a drum stick , to produce the sound .  There is usually a ""resonance head"" on the underside of the drum, these are usually tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drum head.  Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll .  Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments and the most basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.
A drum kit ,drum set, trap set, or just drums is a collection of drums and other percussion instruments , typically cymbals , which are set up on stands to be played by a single player with drumsticks held in both hands and the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum . A drum kit consists of a mix of drums and idiophones most significantly cymbals but also including the woodblock and cowbell.  In the 2000s, some kits also include electronic instruments and both hybrid and entirely electronic kits are used.
A standard modern kit (for a right-handed player), as used in popular music and taught in music schools, contains:
- A snare drum , mounted on a stand , placed between the player's knees and played with drum sticks : 
- A bass drum , played by a pedal operated by the right foot
- Two or more toms , played with sticks or brushes
- A hi-hat , played with the sticks, opened and closed with left foot pedal
- One or more cymbals , played with the sticks
All of these are classed as  non-pitched percussion , allowing for the music to be  scored  using  percussion notation , for which a loose semi-standardized form exists for the drum kit. If some or all of them are replaced by  electronic drums , the scoring and most often positioning remains the same, allowing a standard teaching approach. The drum kit is usually played while seated on a  drum stool  or throne. The drum kit differs from instruments that can be used to produce pitched melodies or chords, even though drums are often placed musically alongside others that do, such as the  piano  or  guitar . The drum kit is part of the standard rhythm section used in many types of popular and traditional music styles ranging from rock and pop to blues and jazz. Other standard instruments used in the  rhythm section  include the  electric bass ,  electric guitar  and  keyboards .
Many drummers  extend  their kits from this basic pattern, adding more drums, more cymbals, and many other instruments including  pitched percussion . In some styles of music particular extensions are normal, for example  double bass drums  in  heavy metal music  and the enlarged kits used by some  progressive rock drummers , which may include unusual instruments such as  gongs . Some performers use  small kits  that omit elements from the basic setup, such as some  rockabilly  drummers. Some drum kit players may have other roles in the band, such as providing  backup vocals , or less commonly,  lead vocals .

Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song)
Keep the Home-Fires Burning ('Till the Boys Come Home) is a British patriotic First World War song composed in 1914 by Ivor Novello with words by Lena Guilbert Ford (whose middle name was sometimes printed as ""Gilbert""). 

The song was published first as ""'Till the Boys Come Home"" on 8 October 1914 by Ascherberg, Hopwood and Crew Ltd. in London.home fire burning

 
A new edition was printed in 1915 with the name Keep the Home-Fires Burning. The song became very popular in the United Kingdom during the war, along with It's a Long Way to Tipperary.

James F. Harrison recorded Keep the Home-Fires Burning in 1915, as did Stanley Kirkby in 1916. Another popular recording was sung by tenor John McCormack in 1917, who was also the first to record It's a Long Way to Tipperary in 1914. (See External links below to hear these recordings of Keep the Home-Fires Burning.) Other versions include one by Frederick J. Wheeler and one by the duet Reed Miller & Frederick Wheeler. 

There is a misconception that Ivor Novello's mother wrote the lyrics for the song (propagated—for example—by patter in recorded performances of British musical comedy duo Hinge and Bracket) but Lena Ford (an American) was a friend and collaborator of Novello, not a blood relation.

Lyrics

They were summoned from the hillside,
They were called in from the glen,
And the country found them ready
At the rallying call for men
Let no tears add to their hardships
As the soldiers pass along,
And although your heart is breaking,
Make it sing this cheery song:

Keep the Home Fires Burning,
While your hearts are yearning.
Though your lads are far away
They dream of home.
There's a silver lining
Through the dark clouds shining,
Turn the dark cloud inside out
Till the boys come home.

Overseas there came a pleading,
""Help a nation in distress.""
And we gave our glorious laddies -
Honour bade us do no less,
For no gallant son of Freedom
To a tyrant's yoke should bend,
And a noble heart must answer
To the sacred call of ""Friend.""

Keep the Home Fires Burning,
While your hearts are yearning.
Though your lads are far away
They dream of home.
There's a silver lining
Through the dark clouds shining,
Turn the dark cloud inside out
'Til the boys come home.

Passage:
Ulna
The ulna (  ) is one of the two long bones in the forearm (the other is the radius). It is on the side opposite the thumb, extends from the elbow to the wrist, and runs parallel to the radius, which it exceeds in length and size. In anatomical position, when the arms are down at the sides of the body and the palms of the hands face forward, the ulna is located at the side of the forearm closest to the body (the medial side). The bone may break due to excessive weight or impact.

Structure

The ulna is broader close to the elbow, and narrows as it approaches the wrist.

Close to the elbow, the ulna has a bony process, the olecranon process, a hook-like structure that fits into the olecranon fossa of the humerus. This prevents hyperextension and forms a hinge joint with the trochlea of the humerus. There is also a radial notch for the head of the radius, and the ulnar tuberosity to which muscles attach.

Close to the wrist, the ulna has a styloid process.

Histology

The ulna is a long bone. The long, narrow medullary cavity of the ulna is enclosed in a strong wall of cortical tissue which is thickest along the interosseous border and dorsal surface. At the extremities the compact layer thins. The compact layer is continued onto the back of the olecranon as a plate of close spongy bone with lamellæ parallel. From the inner surface of this plate and the compact layer below it trabeculæ arch forward toward the olecranon and coronoid and cross other trabeculæ, passing backward over the medullary cavity from the upper part of the shaft below the coronoid. Below the coronoid process there is a small area of compact bone from which trabeculæ curve upward to end obliquely to the surface of the semilunar notch which is coated with a thin layer of compact bone.  The trabeculæ at the lower end have a more longitudinal direction. 

Development

The ulna is ossified from three centers: one each for the body, the inferior extremity, and the top of the olecranon. 
Ossification begins near the middle of the body of the ulna, about the eighth week of fetal life, and soon extends through the greater part of the bone.

At birth, the ends are cartilaginous. About the fourth year, a center appears in the middle of the head, and soon extends into the ulnar styloid process. About the tenth year, a center appears in the olecranon near its extremity, the chief part of this process being formed by an upward extension of the body. The upper epiphysis joins the body about the sixteenth, the lower about the twentieth year.

Function

Joints

The ulna forms part of the wrist joint and elbow joints. Specifically, the ulna articulates with:
* trochlea of the humerus, at the right side elbow as a hinge joint with semilunar trochlear notch of the ulna.
* the radius, near the elbow as a pivot joint, this allows the radius to cross over the ulna in pronation.
* the distal radius, where it fits into the ulnar notch.
* the radius along its length via the interosseous membrane that forms a syndesmosis joint

Muscle attachments

Clinical significance

Fractures

Specific fracture types of the ulna include:
*Monteggia fracture - a fracture of the proximal third of the ulna with the dislocation of the head of the radius
*Hume fracture - a fracture of the olecranon with an associated anterior dislocation of the radial head
Conservative management is possible for ulnar fractures when they are located in the distal two-thirds, only involve the shaft, with no shortening, less than 10° angulation and less than 50% displacement. [https://books.google.se/books?id
ldEgCAAAQBAJ&pgRA1-PA158 Page 158] In such cases, a cast should be applied that goes above the elbow.

In other animals

In four-legged animals, the radius is the main load-bearing bone of the lower forelimb, and the ulna is important primarily for muscular attachment. In many mammals, the ulna is partially or wholly fused with the radius, and may therefore not exist as a separate bone. However, even in extreme cases of fusion, such as in horses, the olecranon process is still present, albeit as a projection from the upper radius.

Rook (bird)
The rook (Corvus frugilegus) is a member of the family Corvidae in the passerine order of birds. It was given its binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in 1758,  The binomial is from Latin; Corvus is for ""raven"", and frugilegus is Latin for ""food-gathering"", from frux, frugis, ""fruit"", and  legere, ""to pick"". the English name is ultimately derived from the bird's harsh call. 

Description

This species is similar in size (45–47 cm in length) to or slightly smaller than the carrion crow with black feathers often showing a blue or bluish-purple sheen in bright sunlight. The feathers on the head, neck and shoulders are particularly dense and silky. The legs and feet are generally black and the bill grey-black.

Rooks are distinguished from similar members of the crow family by the bare grey-white skin around the base of the adult's bill in front of the eyes. The feathering around the legs also looks shaggier and laxer than the congeneric carrion crow. The juvenile is superficially more similar to the crow because it lacks the bare patch at the base of the bill, but it has a thinner bill and loses the facial feathers after about six months. Collective nouns for rooks include building, parliament, clamour and storytelling.   Their colonial nesting behaviour gave rise to the term rookery.

Distribution and habitat

Rooks are resident in Great Britain, Ireland and much of north and central Europe but vagrant to Iceland and parts of Scandinavia, where they typically live south of the 60th latitude and in habitats that ravens dislike, such as open agricultural areas. The rook also occurs as an eastern race in Asia where it differs in being slightly smaller on average, and having a somewhat more fully feathered face. In the north of its range the species has a tendency to move south during autumn though more southern populations are apt to range sporadically also. The species has been introduced to New Zealand, with several hundred birds being released there from 1862 to 1874. Although their range is very localised, the species is now regarded as an invasive pest and is the subject of active control.  Even so, the ecological and economic impacts of rooks in New Zealand have not been well-studied.

Behaviour and ecology

Diet

Food is predominantly earthworms and insect larvae, which the bird finds by probing the ground with its strong bill. It also eats cultivated cereal grain, smaller amounts of fruit, small mammals, acorns, small birds, their eggs and young and carrion. In urban sites, human food scraps are taken from rubbish dumps and streets, usually in the early hours when it is relatively quiet. It can also be seen along the seashore, feeding on insects, crustaceans and edible flotsam. Like other corvids, Rooks in urban or suburban areas will sometimes favour sites with a high level of human interaction, and can often be found scavenging for food in places such as theme parks and piers.

Nesting

Nesting in a rookery is always colonial, usually in the very tops of the trees. Branches and twigs are broken off trees (very rarely picked up off the ground), though as many are likely to be stolen from nearby nests as are collected from trees. Eggs are usually 3–5 in number, can appear by the end of February or early March and are incubated for 16–18 days. Both adults feed the young, which are fledged by the 32nd or 33rd day.

In autumn, the young birds of the summer collect into large flocks together with unpaired birds of previous seasons, often in company with jackdaws. It is during the autumn that spectacular aerial displays can be seen by adult birds that seem to delight in the autumn gales.

Voice

The call is usually described as kaah—it is similar to that of the carrion crow, but usually rather flatter in tone. It is given both in flight and while perched, when the bird fans its tail and bows on each caw. Calls in flight are usually given singly, in contrast to the carrion crow's which are in groups of three or four. Solitary birds often ""sing"" apparently to themselves, uttering strange clicks, wheezes and human-like notes.

Intelligence

In captivity, when confronted with problems, rooks have been documented as one of several species of birds capable of using tools. Rooks learned that if they push a stone off a ledge into a tube, they will get food. The rooks then discovered they could find and bring a stone and carry it to the tube if no stone was there already. They also used sticks and wire, and figured out how to bend a wire into a hook to reach an item.  Rooks are as clever at making and using simple tools with their beaks as chimpanzees are with their hands. 

In one experiment, a rook was placed near a tube of water, with a worm floating on top of the water, and some rocks next to the tube. The water level was too low for the rook to reach the worm, so it placed rocks into the tube until the level was high enough.Videos can be seen on YouTube, with at least three different rooks: Connelly ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?vB7cw_9AT5hg trial 1] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v

The World's Most Northernmost Cities List
By Amanda Briney
Updated October 12, 2016.
The Northern Hemisphere is known for having more land than the Southern Hemisphere . However, much of that land is undeveloped and the areas that are developed into large cities and towns are clustered in lower latitudes in places like the United States and central Europe. The largest city with the highest latitude is Helsinki, Finland . It is located at a latitude of 60°10'15''N and it has a metropolitan population of over one million people. Reykjavík, Iceland is the world's northernmost capital city with a latitude just under the Arctic Circle at 64°08'N. Reykjavík is also large with a 2008 population of 120,165.
Large cities like Helsinki and Reykjavík are rare in the far north. There are however, some small towns and cities that are located very far north in the harsh climates of the Arctic Circle above 66.5°N latitude. The following is a list of the world's ten northernmost settlements with a permanent population of over 500.

Derek McCulloch
Derek Ivor Breashur McCulloch OBE (18 November 1897 – 1 June 1967) was a BBC Radio presenter and producer. He became known as ""Uncle Mac"" in Children's Favourites and Children's Hour, and the voice of ""Larry the Lamb"" in Toytown. He was the head of children's broadcasting for the BBC from 1933 until 1951.

Early life

McCulloch was born in Plymouth to Scottish parents.  The First World War interrupted his education, and he enlisted in 1915 in the Public Schools Battalion of the 16th Middlesex Regiment at the age of 17. He served until 1921 with the infantry, where he was commissioned into the Green Howards, and in the Royal Flying Corps as an equipment officer, including a spell on HMS Valiant. He was wounded at the Battle of the Somme in 1916. After the war he worked in Argentina on the railways, but had to return to England because of ill health.Mckenzie, Jim.

Career

BBC

He joined the BBC in 1926 as an announcer. He was the commentator on the first radio broadcast of the FA Cup Final in 1927.[http://www.radioacademy.org/hall-of-fame-member/derek-mcculloch/ The Radio Academy: Derek McCulloch]. Accessed 30 October 2012 He became second in command on Children's Hour in 1931 and was placed in charge of it in 1933. The programme included talks, plays, music and drama serials. He was appointed head of children's broadcasting in 1933, serving in that position until 1951.Strinati, D. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?ide9Gunp4h1N4C&pg
PA153 Come on Down?: The Politics of Popular Media Culture in Post-War Britain], Psychology Press, 1992, pp. 153, 157. He regarded the department as a microcosm of all broadcasting, stating: ""Nothing but the best is good enough for children ... our wish is to stimulate their imaginations, direct their reading, encourage their various interests, widen their outlook and inculcate the Christian virtues of love of God and their neighbours.""  In 1938 he lost a leg as the result of a road accident, and thereafter remained in constant pain.

In 1939 the audience for Children's Hour reached four million. His sign-off line, ""Goodnight children, everywhere,"" became more poignant after the evacuation of many children from their homes at the start of the Second World War. He resigned from the BBC in 1950 due to ill health.

Children's Favourites

He became the children's editor for the News Chronicle.  In 1954 he returned to the BBC, to present a BBC music request programme for children, Children's Favourites, on Saturday mornings. The programme was dropped in 1964, despite protests and questions in Parliament, but it was popular, and McCulloch continued to present it until 1965. After his retirement it became Junior Choice, hosted by Ed Stewart, when the BBC Light Programme was replaced by Radio 1 and Radio 2 in 1967.

Writing

He wrote two children's stories, Cornish Adventure (1941) and Cornish Mystery (1950), and gave his name to a series of Ladybird children's books in the 1950s.

Personal life

McCulloch married Eileen Hilda Barry in 1931. He was awarded an OBE in 1964. He died at Haywards Heath on 1 June 1967.

He was the subject of This Is Your Life in February 1964 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in central London.

Passage:
Bloodgate
The Bloodgate Scandal was a rugby union scandal involving the English team Harlequins in their Heineken Cup match against the Irish side Leinster on 12 April 2009. It was so called because of the use of fake blood capsules, and has been seen by some as one of the biggest scandals in rugby since professionalisation in the mid-1990s.

Events

During the quarter final of the 2009 Heineken Cup against Leinster, Harlequins wing Tom Williams came off the field with what turned out to be a faked blood injury in order to facilitate a tactical substitution for Nick Evans to re-enter the field having gone off earlier injured. An investigation by the ERC and the RFU revealed that blood injuries had also been faked by Harlequins to enable tactical substitutions on four previous occasions. These findings resulted in a twelve-month ban for Williams (reduced to 4 months on appeal  ), a three-year ban for former director of rugby Dean Richards and a two-year ban for physiotherapist Steph Brennan as well as a £260,000 fine for the club.  
The club chairman Charles Jillings subsequently tendered his resignation  while the club doctor Wendy Chapman was suspended by the GMC for cutting Williams's lip to hide his use of the blood capsule. 
On 2 September 2009, it was reported that Harlequins had escaped being thrown out of the Heineken Cup following the scandal when the board of organisers European Rugby Cup (ERC) said it approved of the bans and fines already handed out. 

The affair was dubbed by many in the media ""Bloodgate"". Leinster won the game 6-5, going on to win the Heineken Cup for the first time.

Aftermath

Mark Evans, chief executive of Harlequin FC has said:
""You would be incredibly naive to think (the Bloodgate stigma) will ever disappear completely. Things like that don't. They become part of history and, like good or bad seasons, are woven into the fabric of any club."" 

Richards resigned from his post at Harlequins over an incident in which it was acknowledged that he had orchestrated and had ""central control""  over a fake blood injury to Tom Williams during a Heineken Cup fixture against Leinster.  He was given a three-year suspension from coaching as punishment. 
The International Rugby Board (IRB) also confirmed that they would apply the ban to rugby union worldwide. 

Dr Chapman, the medic who cut Williams' lip, appeared  before the General Medical Council charged with alleged conduct likely to bring the profession into disrepute.  The appearance resulted in Dr Chapman being warned but allowed to continue practising medicine.

Fiddler's Dram
Fiddler's Dram were a British folk band of the late 1970s. They are mainly known for their hit single, ""Day Trip to Bangor (Didn't We Have a Lovely Time)"" (1979), although the sound of this record was not representative of the acoustic songs and tunes they had been performing for several years at folk clubs and festivals.

Band members

The full-time members of Fiddler's Dram were drawn from the Oyster Ceilidh Band and were:
* Cathy Lesurf - vocals, bodhran
* Alan Prosser - guitar, fiddle, bowed psaltery, bones
* Chris Taylor - bouzouki, harmonica, appalachian dulcimer, mandola, tenor banjo
* Ian Telfer - fiddle, bowed psaltery, viola, English Concertina

later joined by
* Will Ward - Bassoon, Recorder, Crumhorn

Career

Dave Arbus, violinist with East of Eden, was a founder member but left long before the band achieved success. 

The full-time members of the band were drawn from a group of musicians at the University of Kent at Canterbury and members of Duke's Folk Club in Whitstable. Jamming sessions in a Canterbury squat often took place with additional club members given the opportunity to take part in these sessions and sometimes at local performances. The band had an enthusiastic local following and played regularly at local clubs and bars in and around the Canterbury area, with the open nature of the bands ever changing part-time line-up contributing to the bands popularity. With other various club members, including John Jones and Ian Kearey, the full-time members of the band formed the Oyster Ceilidh Band in about 1976, with Cathy Lesurf singing and later assuming the role of caller at dances.

The first Fiddler's Dram album To See the Play was released on the Dingles label in 1978.  It featured acoustic arrangements of mainly British traditional songs and tunes, but also included live favourite ""Day Trip to Bangor"", written by Whitstable Folk Club regular Debbie Cook. Dingles' David Foister suggested that this track be released as a single. It was re-recorded at a faster tempo than on the original LP, and with the acoustic instruments augmented by other instruments including bass guitar, synthesiser and drums. 

It has been claimed that ""Day Trip To Bangor"" was actually inspired by a day trip to Rhyl (a seaside resort 35 miles east of Bangor, North Wales), but because Bangor had an extra syllable and slipped off the tongue more easily, it was used instead of Rhyl. This caused an outcry from councillors and businesses in Rhyl who complained that the publicity would have boosted the resort's tourist economy. Songwriter Cook has unconditionally denied this, however  Cook, when interviewed for the BBC Radio 4 documentary, broadcast on 29 September 2011, said the song was ""absolutely yes"" about the Bangor in Wales. She said ""I was so ignorant at the time that I didn't know that any other Bangor existed, so it was categorically this Bangor, and it was Bangor because it scanned and for no other reason than that. And it was the only place I knew along the north Wales coast."" In the documentary, when interviewer Jonathan Maitland reminded Cook that there was a furore about the song really being about Rhyl, Cook laughed and called it ""a great piece of nonsense"".

The single reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1980, having been released the previous year, and is now available via iTunes. 

A version of the song, with altered lyrics, was used the following year in a TV commercial for Anchor butter. The band received no royalties for this, and the story was featured on the BBC TV series That's Life!. Also in 1980, a spoof version, ""Day Trip To Barnhurst"" by Jackie & The Commuters, was released on a single and much played on Capital Radio though without any chart success.

Songwriter Cook subsequently went on to write scripts for The Archers and EastEnders.  

Will Ward had joined the Oyster Ceilidh Band by 1978, and became the fifth member of Fiddler's Dram on their eponymous second LP, recorded hurriedly to follow up on their unexpected success in the UK Singles Chart. The band were unable to achieve subsequent success however — in the words of Ian Telfer ""Day Trip To Bangor"" was ""the kind of success you don't easily recover from. Fiddler's Dram did one more tour then gratefully took the money (and the gold discs) and ran"". 

The Oyster Ceilidh Band continued as both a dance and concert band however, changing their name around 1982 to The Oyster Band and later to just Oysterband. Cathy Lesurf subsequently left the Oysters for a spell with the Albion Band.

In 2009 Lesurf released a Christmas single called ""Christmas Time"". She said she hoped it would be a hit so it would be a ""companion"" for ""Day Trip to Bangor"".

harpy : definition of harpy and synonyms of harpy (English)
harpy : definition of harpy and synonyms of harpy (English)
Siren , sphinx , centaur
In Greek mythology , a harpy (""snatcher"", from Latin : harpeia, originating in Greek : ἅρπυια, harpūia) was one of the winged spirits best known for constantly stealing all food from Phineus . The literal meaning of the word seems to be ""that which snatches"" as it comes from the ancient Greek word harpazein (ἁρπάζειν), which means ""to snatch"".
A harpy was the mother by the West Wind Zephyros of the horses of Achilles . [1]
Hesiod [2] calls them two ""lovely-haired"" creatures, and pottery art depicting the harpies featured beautiful women with wings. Harpies as ugly winged bird-women, e.g. in Aeschylus ' The Eumenides (line 50) are a late development, due to a confusion with the Sirens . Roman and Byzantine writers detailed their ugliness. [3]
Contents
The harpies were sisters of Iris , daughters of Thaumas and Electra . [4]
Phineus , a king of Thrace , had the gift of prophecy . Zeus, angry that Phineas revealed too much, punished him by blinding him and putting him on an island with a buffet of food which he could never eat. The harpies always arrived and stole the food out of his hands before he could satisfy his hunger, and befouled the remains of his food. This continued until the arrival of Jason and the Argonauts . The Boreads , sons of Boreas , the North Wind, who also could fly, succeeded in driving off the harpies, but without killing any of them, following a request from Iris , who promised that Phineas would not be bothered by the harpies again, and ""the dogs of great Zeus"" returned to their ""cave in Minoan Crete"". Thankful for their help, Phineas told the Argonauts how to pass the Symplegades . [5]
In this form they were agents of punishment who abducted people and tortured them on their way to Tartarus . They were vicious, cruel and violent. They lived on the islands of the Strophades . They were usually seen as the personifications of the destructive nature of wind. The harpies in this tradition, now thought of as three sisters instead of the original two, were: Aello (""storm swift""), Celaeno (""the dark"") — also known as Podarge (""fleet-foot"") — and Ocypete (""the swift wing"").
Aeneas encountered harpies on the Strophades as they repeatedly made off with the feast the Trojans were setting. Celaeno cursed them, saying the Trojans will be so hungry they will eat their tables before they reach the end of their journey. The Trojans fled in fear.
  Harpies in the infernal wood, from Inferno XIII, by Gustave Doré , 1861
Harpies remained vivid in the Middle Ages. In his Inferno, XIII, Dante envisages the tortured wood infested with harpies, where the suicides have their punishment in the seventh ring of Hell:
Here the repellent harpies make their nests,
Who drove the Trojans from the Strophades
With dire announcements of the coming woe.
They have broad wings, a human neck and face,
Clawed feet and swollen, feathered bellies; they caw
Their lamentations in the eerie trees. [6]
William Blake was inspired by Dante's description in his pencil, ink and watercolour "" The Wood of the Self-Murderers: The Harpies and the Suicides "" (Tate Gallery, London).
  Heraldry
In the Middle Ages , the harpy, often called the ""virgin eagle"", became a popular charge in heraldry , particularly in East Frisia , seen on, among others, the coats-of-arms of Rietburg , Liechtenstein , and the Cirksena
  Harpies in reality
The American Harpy Eagle is a real bird named after the mythological animal.
The term is often used metaphorically to refer to a nasty or annoying woman. In Shakespeare 's Much Ado About Nothing , Benedick spots the sharp-tongued Beatrice approaching and exclaims to the Prince, Don Pedro, that he would do an assortment of arduous tasks for him ""rather than hold three words conference with this harpy!""
  Harpies in popular culture
With their composite form and violent nature, harpies are depicted in films, television and other aspects of popular culture. Harpies are commonly depicted as a race of bird-women, such as in Philip Pullman 's His Dark Materials book series. Occasionally the classic harpies are referenced by name, such as the appearance of Celaeno in Peter S. Beagle 's novel The Last Unicorn . Harpies are also mentioned in the Percy Jackson series.
The character Mai Valentine in the Yu-gi-oh series uses a card deck based around Harpies.
Harpies appear as a minor enemy throughout the God of War video game series which is loosely based on Greek mythology.

Cervelat
Cervelat, also cervelas, servelat or zervelat, is a sausage produced in Switzerland, France (especially Alsace and Lyon) and parts of Germany. The recipe and preparation of the sausage vary regionally.

The sausages are called cervelas in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, Cervelat in the German-speaking part, and servelat in the Italian-speaking part. The terms ultimately derive from cerebrum, the Latin word for brain, which was used in early recipes. The term ""Cervelat"" is the oldest of the three. It was first recorded in 1552 by Rabelais, and is derived from zervelada, a Milanese dialect word meaning  a ""large, short sausage filled with meat and pork brains."" Modern recipes do not include brains, and arose towards the end of the 19th century in Basel, as a reworking of the traditional recipe.

The taste of the sausages depends on the region, but generally they are similar to that of a frankfurter, but with a smokier flavour and a texture brought about by its fat shape and the tightly wrapped natural casing. Various European semi-dry cervelat are similar to summer sausage in the U.S., and Thuringian sausage can be considered a type of cervelat. 

Switzerland

In Switzerland, cervelats are cooked (slightly smoked and then boiled) or served raw. They contain a mixture of beef, bacon and pork rind. The modern Swiss variety is packed into zebu intestines.

The cervelat is often referred to as the national sausage of Switzerland. Some 160 million cervelats weighing 27,000 metric tons are produced in Switzerland annually, which is equivalent to a consumption of 25 cervelats per person each year. Grilling cervelats over an open fire with the ends cut open so they expand like a butterfly's wings is a childhood memory for nearly every Swiss person; as a result, many Swiss are emotionally attached to the sausage.
Swiss cervelats are made of roughly equal parts of beef, pork, bacon, pork rind and ice, which helps bind the ingredients, along with spices, curing salt and cutter additives. The ingredients are finely minced in a cutter, packed into beef intestines, smoked for an hour and then cooked by boiling for a short time. Processed and packaged varieties sold in Swiss supermarkets also contain nitrites and antioxidants.  A cervelat may weigh from about 100 to 200 grams.

Swiss cervelats are prepared and eaten cooked or raw. They are boiled, grilled or fried. They can also be served uncooked, either in a salad or with bread and mustard.

Sometimes sold smoked and uncooked, cervelat can be seasoned, salted and cold smoked for one day. 

2008 casings shortage

Traditionally, Swiss beef intestines were used for the casings, but towards the end of the 20th century, local cattle producers lost interest in cleaning and preparing them, so meat processors switched to Brazilian zebu intestines, which are not fatty and do not easily split open when roasted. However, beginning on 1 April 2006, the European Union banned the import of many animal parts from Brazil as a measure aimed at preventing the spread of mad cow disease. Among these were beef intestines. Although Switzerland is not an EU member state, it is bound to observe European food protection laws through other treaty agreements. Hence, Swiss and German stockpiles of zebu intestines became very low by 2008, threatening production altogether, and causing some controversy in Switzerland. In January of that year, the Swiss meat industry announced that a national ""cervelat task force"" had failed in an exhaustive search for an acceptable alternative to zebu intestines.

The New York Times noted that ""the possible demise of cervelas visibly upset the Swiss, a normally even-tempered people."" The cervelat production crisis was covered closely by the Swiss media and in a newspaper poll, 72% of those surveyed said the ""cervelas, as they knew it, had to be saved."" The cervelat crisis was brought up in a parliamentary debate wherein state councillor and president of the Swiss Meat Association, Rolf Büttiker, spoke of the national sausage's social significance, calling it a ""cult sausage"" and ""the worker's steak"".  The Swiss government entered into negotiations with the EU to seek an exception for zebu intestines, and Swiss scientists were sent to Brazil hoping to show that the intestines posed no risk of transmitting mad cow disease.

By August 2008, most of the Swiss demand for bovine intestines had been met with imports from Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay. 

France

Cervelas de Lyon are a sausage specialty of Lyonnaise cuisine. They contain finely minced pork, and either truffles or pistachios. Sold uncooked, the sausage has to be boiled before it is eaten.  

In Alsatian cuisine, cervelas d'Alsace are split open and served with cheese (gruyere) and bacon.

Passport by Nana Mouskouri on Apple Music
21 Songs
Album Review
The conceit of this double album-length set is that Nana Mouskouri is doing songs from different nations. However, even though Passport is a compilation recorded over a span of over a decade with a variety of accompanists ranging from Mouskouri's original backing group, the Athenians, to the easy listening specialists the Mike Sammes Singers, the albums sounds as if it could have been recorded during one lengthy session. Such is the strength of Mouskouri's jazzy, middle-of-the-road pop style that songs as varied as her biggest hit, ""Never on Sunday"" (here presented in its original Greek lyrics as ""Ta Pedia Tou Pirea""), Paul Simon's ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" and the traditional ""Amazing Grace"" end up sounding pretty much the same. Passport's worth depends entirely on the listener's tolerance for this kind of Eurovision Song Contest style of pop, but few people working in this style in the '60s and '70s were better than Nana Mouskouri. (Only the great Petula Clark comes immediately to mind.) Although perhaps better known in the United States for her lovely olive-skinned looks and trademark glasses than for her singing, Mouskouri's a genuinely superb jazz-pop singer with a bewitching voice and an ear for material that rises above the occasionally gloppy easy listening arrangements she's often saddled with. Unfortunately, there's more than a few of those arrangements on Passport, but there's also a number of truly impressive songs. Two particular standouts come from rare sessions with producers other than Mouskouri's usual collaborator Andre Chapelle. The countryish ""The Loving Song,"" produced by American hitmaker Snuff Garrett, is a surprisingly solid take on the genre, but 1972's ""Four and Twenty Hours,"" written and produced by the early-'70s British hit factory Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway, is one of Mouskouri's finest singles ever, a mature but remarkably catchy slice of AM radio fluff that predicts the sound that ABBA would take to the top of the charts later in the decade.

Somali-born Londoner produced the greatest performance of his life at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon. Farah blew away his opponents to cross the line in 26min 46.57sec — comfortably inside the previous 11-year-old European record of 26-52.30 held by Belgium’s Mohammed Mourhit. The time also took him to the top of this year's world rankings, not to mention 14th on the world all-time list, and served notice that after his 5,000-10,000m double at last summer's European Championships in Barcelona, he is now ready to challenge for silverware at world and Olympic level. “I just sat at the back and worked my way through the field,” he said. ‘I want to thank my coach, who has worked me really hard on the Oregon Project.

Gatlin, who is returning from a drugs ban, broke the 10 second barrier with a time of 9.97, but finished well adrift of Jamaica's Steve Mullings who won in 9.80. Ian Stewart, who won the Olympic 5,000m bronze in 1972 and is now UK Athletics’ head of endurance, hailed Farah’s performance as a major breakthrough. Six of the eight runners finished in under 10 seconds as the wind helped in Oregon. Greg Rutherford won the long jump in 8.32m, 2cm further than his record from the 2009 World Championships, but the conditions meant it will not stand as a British record. Caster Semenya made her Diamond League debut in the 800m, but could only manage second place behind Kenia Sinclair. American Tyson Gay sent a message to Usain Bolt and his other 100m rivals by clocking a scorching 9.79sec at a low-key meeting in Clermont, Florida, to leap to top of the world rankings. John Lowe, the 1978 champion and four-time runner-up in the event, beat three-time defending champion Eric Bristow in a repeat of the 1981 and 1985 finals. The 1987 Embassy World Darts Championship was held at the Lakeside Country Club in Frimley Green, Surrey between 9 and 17 January 1987. The prize fund was £62,000, with £14,000 going to the champion and £7,000 to runners-up. The painting by John Constable is based on a group of haymakers at a site in Suffolk, near Flatford on the River Stour. The haymakers were rented on the right, a horse-drawn cart stands in the foreground, and a type of horse in the distance is on the left. The work is by John Wainain, who was based on the work by The Haymakers at the National Gallery, London, in the 1950s and 1960s. The paintings are a vertical tricolour black and red (in that order) from left to right. See Flags of Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands for more information on the different European flags and the different colours used in each country. The flag of the United Kingdom is a vertical red and yellow tricolor black and white (in the order of that order from black to red). The flag is also a vertical blue and white tricolours black and yellow. Constable's time. Constable first made a number of open-air sketches of parts of the scene. He then made a full-size preparatory sketch in oil to establish the composition. The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821, the year it was painted, but failed to find a buyer. Yet when exhibited in France, with other paintings by Constable, the artist was awarded a Gold Medal by Charles X. Briggs, his wife Sarah and two-year-old daughter Sophia Matilda, along with the crew of the Mary Celeste, and the lifeboat, were never found and presumed lost. Briggs is the main protagonist in the game Limbo in which Briggs must solve puzzles to escape Limbo. The Briggs family of Massachusetts had a long maritime connection, and Benjamin Briggs himself spent most of his life at sea. He was an experienced, hardy and able seaman. He reportedly was respected by those who served under him because of his fairness and ability. Briggs captained the brigantine Sea Foam, and in 1862 became master of the three-masted schooner Forest King. The following month Briggs' ship was found inexplicably abandoned in the Atlantic Ocean near the Straits of Gibraltar, on December 4, 1872. The lifeboat was missing, yet the ship herself was still under sail and there were signs of a sudden and unexplained abandonment. Briggs and his wife and daughter were never Found and their fate remains a mystery. A cenotaph memorializing the family stands in Evergreen Cemetery, Marion, Massachusetts. The inscription reads: ""Capt. Benj S. Briggs born Apr 24, 1835, Sarah E Cobb born Apr 20, 1841, Sophia M, their daughter, then 10 mos, born Oct 31, 1870. Lost in Brig Mary Celeste Nov 1872""    Benjamin Spooner Briggs was the captain of the famous ship, in which water, everywhere but not a drop to drink, was found. He is famous today for being the Captain of the merchant ship Mary Celesta when she was discovered unmanned and drifting in theAtlantic Ocean. He died in 1872 and is survived by his son Arthur who was left at home with his grandmother, including Benjamin Yarbrough Briggs, of Boston, Massachusetts and New York City. The ad, which appeared in Elle UK magazine, featured a black-and-white photo of a woman described by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) as ‘unhealthily underweight’ The ASA said the model’s pose and the lighting drew particular focus to her chest, where her rib cage was visible and appeared prominent, and to her legs where her thighs and knees appeared a similar width. A reader complained that the ad was irresponsible for using a model who appeared to be unhealthily thin. YSL “indicated that they did not agree with the complainant's view that the model was un healthily thin” but did not provide a detailed response. The ASA ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding: “We told the advertisers to ensure the ad is never used again”. The ad is the eighth most complained about advert, receiving 948 complaints. The most controversial fashion advert is the Yves Saint Laurent Opium perfume advert, which was removed from billboards as it was deemed ‘sexually suggestive and unsuitable to be seen by children’. The advert was banned in Spain after it was thought to ‘glorify rape’ by designer Stefano Gabbana. The campaign was banned from all UK television channels, except BBC1, and was only permitted to be shown in cinemas. It is thought to have caused car accidents, such was the provocative appeal of the Wonderbra advert in 1994. The controversial advert was shot by Terry Richardson and featured Dakota Fanning, who was 17 when she was shot for Marc Jacobs. The picture was banned because it ‘sexualised’ children. The brand withdrew it from child welfare authorities after it provoked a negative response from Steven Meisel, who said it was ‘too risqué’ and ‘controversial’ to show. It has since been withdrawn from all British cinemas and is no longer shown on British television. It was also banned in the U.S. because it was considered ‘inappropriate’ for children to be wearing it in the first place. The model in the advert is a 17-year-old girl, who has never been seen in public in her life. The image has been removed from the internet and the brand has not responded to a request for comment from MailOnline for this article.

The word is not found in major English dictionaries and it is not a recognized scientific discipline in English-speaking countries. People who informally study the dog may refer to themselves as 'cynologists' to imply serious study or scientific work. The very rare term cynologist in English, is generally found to refer to ""canine specialists"" such as; certified care professionals, certified show judges, breeders, breed enthusiasts, certified dog-trainers and professional dog-handlers. A veterinary clinic in Armenia offers a ‘cynologist’ to assist with dog training. A magazine in the Baltic states described as ‘dedicated to the development of cynology in the. Baltic countries’ covers dog training, dog shows, and veterinary advice (a hobbyist magazine, not a scientific journal.) The word cynology is also used in the names of dog training academies, with cynologist sometimes being used as a title by some dog trainers or handlers. It is also the source of the English word cynic, and is directly related to canine and hound. It may be a term sometimes used to denote serious zoological approach to theStudy of dogs as well as by writers on canine subjects, dog breeders and trainers   and enthusiasts who Informally Study the dog. In other languages, such German and Dutch kynologie, and the Russian  “Kynology”, the word is found in German, Dutch, Czech and Slovakian languages, and may have other connotations or use in languages other than English, see German :de:Kynologistie, Dutch :nl:Kynerologie and Czech :cs:Sportovní kyberologie. In English, the suffix ‘-logy’ in English words refers to a study, or an academic discipline, or field of scientific study. English Classical compound words of this type may confer an impression of scientific rigor on a non-scientific occupation or profession. Informally, dogs may be studied by those with no specific scientific training, such as publicists and authors, Breeders, trainers, police dog handlers, animal communicators and others, through literature, history,and personal experience. In the UK, the term ‘canine specialist’ is used to describe dog handlers and breeders. ""That's Livin' Alright"" peaked at #3 on the UK Singles Chart in January 1984. Ian La Frenais co-wrote Auf Wiedersehen, Pet with Dick Clement. For England's national football team's 2006 FIFA World Cup campaign, Fagin performed ""That's England Alright"" Sir Anthony Caro is a British sculptor. He is best known for his work at the Whitechapel London Gallery in 1963. He was awarded the Pipeman of the Year award in 1965 by the Briar Pipe Trade Association. He died in October 2013 at the age of 89. His son, Michael, is also a sculptor, and works at the Tate Modern in London. His wife, Ethel, is a well-known actress, and their son Michael is a film-maker. She is the mother of two sons, Michael and Robert, who were born in the 1970s and 1980s. She died in 2012 at the home of her late husband, the late Peter Sellers. She was buried in a private ceremony in New York City. Her husband was buried at Mount Vernon, New York, in the 1930s. He also died in the 1990s at the family home in New Jersey. He and his wife were executed in 1953 in the most controversial espionage case of the Cold War. They were accused of heading a spy ring that passed top-secret information concerning the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union. The couple vigorously protested their innocence and proclaimed their innocence right up to the time of their deaths. They refused to admit any wrongdoing. Many people believed that the Rosenbergs were the victims of a surge of hysterical anticommunist feeling in the United States, and protested that the death sentence handed down was cruel and unusual punishment. President Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke for many Americans when he issued a statement declining to invoke executive clemency for the pair. He stated, “I can only say that, by immeasurably increasing the chances of atomic war, the. Rosenbergs may have condemned to death tens of millions of innocent people all over the world.” The execution of two human beings is a grave matter. But even graver is the thought of the millions of dead whose deaths may be directly attributable to what these spies have done.’ The couple were executed on June 19, 1953. at a lunch in London's Savoy Hotel each January. The award was discontinued in 2004 because its organisers feared it fell foul of laws banning all advertising and promotion of tobacco. It was reintroduced in 2014, by the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs, at the British Pipe Smoking Championship at Newark Showground. In a departure from previous awards the recipient was not a celebrity, but the outgoing President of the UK federation Brian Mills. A drum kit consists of a mix of drums and idiophones most significantly cymbals but also including the woodblock and cowbell. A standard modern kit (for a right-handed player), as used in popular music and taught in music schools, contains:- A snare drum, placed between the player's knees and played with drum sticks :  A bass drum, played by a pedal operated by the right foot. Two or more toms, played with sticks or brushes.- One or more cymbal, played with the sticks, opened and closed with the left foot pedal- A hi-hat drum, with a beater for the bass drum on the top of the drum, which is usually tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drum head. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. The drum kit is usually played while seated on a stool or throne, even though drums can be used that are often placed or pitched to produce chords, though even though the melodies are often musi to produce pitched or even pitched, though they are not pitch-pitched. The drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments and have remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years. There is usually a ""resonance head"" on the underside of a drum, usually tuned  to a slight lower pitch than the top Drum head. If some of the drums in a drum kit are replaced by electronic drums, the scoring remains the same, allowing a standard teaching approach, allowing for the music to be scored for which a standard form of percussion notation exists for the drum kit exists. For more information on drum kits, see the Drum Set Guide by the British Drum Association (BSA) and the Drum Kit Handbook by the Royal College of Music (RCM). For more on drum kit teaching, visit the BSA's Drum Kit Guide by clicking here. For a guide on how to play drums, click here. The drum kit is part of the standard rhythm section used in many types of popular and traditional music styles ranging from rock and pop to blues and jazz. Many drummers  extend  their kits from this basic pattern, adding more drums, more cymbals, and many other instruments including pitched percussion. The song was published first as ""'Till the Boys Come Home"" on 8 October 1914 by Ascherberg, Hopwood and Crew Ltd. in London. A new edition was printed in 1915 with the name Keep the Home-Fires Burning. It became very popular in the United Kingdom during the war, along with It's a Long Way to Tipperary. Other versions include one by Frederick J. Wheeler and one by the duet Reed Miller & Frederick Wheeler. It was included in the musical Oh! What a Lovely War and in the film Darling Lili. It is also featured in the 1981 film Chili* and the 2002 film Johnny Got Gun. The drum kit players may have other roles in the band, such as providing backup vocals, or less commonly,  lead vocals. The drums make a sound technically called a 'chick' when played closed. They can also be used to play other instruments such as the piano, guitar, and keyboards. They are also used to make the sound of a drop clutch, which is the sound made when the drum is played with the palm of your hand. The instrument is called a ""chick"" when it is used in a variety of ways, including as a percussion instrument, a bass drum, a guitar, a keyboard, and a bass guitar. It has been used in the music video, ""One"", for the song ""One"" by Seán O'Casey play the piano on the end of Metallica's ""Casey O'Mara's O' casey play ""One"". The song is sung by Joan Fontaine and a group of British soldiers in the 1942 film This Above All (film) (film). It was also used at end of the Metallica video, 'One', for ""One O'Clock in the Dark"" by the band Metallica. It also appears in the 2007 film The Adventures of Tintin, starring Liam Neeson and Kate Winslet, as well as in the TV series The X-Files and the film The Hobbit. It can be heard on the soundtrack to the movie The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, starring Tom Hanks. The ulna (  ) is one of the two long bones in the forearm (the other is the radius) It is on the side opposite the thumb, extends from the elbow to the wrist, and runs parallel to the radius. The ulna is broader close to the elbow, and narrows as it approaches the wrist. The bone may break due to excessive weight or impact. It forms part of the wrist joint and elbow joints. It articulates with the trochlea of the humerus and the ulnar tuberosity to which muscles attach. It is possible for ulnar fractures when they are located in the two-thirds of the distal shaft, located less than 10° away from the head of the radius, and involve no shortening, angulation, or dislocation of the head. The most common type of ulna fracture is a fracture of the proximal third of the olecranon, which is located near the right side of the elbow. It can also be caused by fractures of the ulna in the radius along the interosseous membrane, where it forms a syndesmosis that forms a joint with the humingus. The last refrain is sung by the employees of Are You Being Served? in the episode ""Camping In"" The song is briefly heard in a scene of new army recruits marching in a parade in the 1930 film A Soldier's Plaything. It was written by Ivor Novello, who also wrote the music for the song Keep the Home Fires Burning. For more information on the song, see: http://www.novello.com/songs/keep-the-home-fires-burning.html. The main chorus of the song is sung on M*A*S*H in Episode 127 (Season 5) ""War of Nerves"" during a stress relief ""bon-type-fire"" During the episode, the cast sings the refrain of ""The Plough and the Stars"" for the first time. The song was written in the early 20th century by the Italian composer Giuseppe Maffeo, who later wrote the score for The Wizard of Oz and The Lord of the Rings. The lyrics to the song are: ""Keep the Homefires Burning"" and ""The Great Gatsby"" The main refrain is also sung on the TV show ""The Adventures of H.A.M. P. Ghibli"" and the movie The Godfather: Part II: ""The Godfather"" The rook (Corvus frugilegus) is a member of the family Corvidae in the passerine order of birds. The species is similar in size (45–47cm in length) to or slightly smaller than the carrion crow with black feathers often showing a blue or bluish-purple sheen in bright sunlight. The feathers on the head, neck and shoulders are particularly dense and silky. The legs and feet are generally black and the bill grey-black. Rooks are distinguished from similar members of the crow family by the bare grey-white skin around the base of the adult's bill in front of the eyes. The juvenile is superficially more similar to the crow because it has a thinner bill and loses the facial feathers after about six months. Their colonial nesting behaviour gave rise to the term rookery. They are resident in Great Britain, central Europe but vagrant to Iceland and parts of Scandinavia, where they typically live south of the 60th latitude and in habitats that ravens dislike, such as open agricultural areas. In urban sites, human food scraps are taken from dumps and streets when it is relatively quiet. Like other corvids and edible flots, Rooks can often be found in places such as theme parks and piers. They can also be seen feeding on insects, crustaceans, and a high level of human interaction in urban areas, and often favouring high level parks and theme parks with high levels of displacement. In many mammals, the ulna is partially or wholly fused with the radius, and may therefore not exist as a separate bone. In such cases, a cast should be applied that goes above the elbow. In horses, the olecranon process is still present, albeit as a projection from the upper radius. In other animals, the radius is the main load-bearing bone of the lower forelimb, and the Ulna is important primarily for muscular attachment. The rook also occurs as an eastern race in Asia where it differs in being slightly smaller on average, and having a somewhat more fully feathered face. In the north of its range the species has a tendency to move south during autumn though more southern populations are apt to range sporadically also. Although their range is very localised, the species is now regarded as an invasive pest and is the subject of active control. Rooks have been documented as one of several species of birds capable of using tools. Rooks are as clever at making and using simple tools with their beaks as chimpanzees are with their hands. The largest city with the highest latitude is Helsinki, Finland. Reykjavík, Iceland is the world's northernmost capital city with a latitude just under the Arctic Circle at 64°08'N. The list is arranged in order of latitude and population numbers have been included for reference. The world's ten northernmost settlements with a permanent population of over 500 are: Longvalbard, Norway, Helsinki, Iceland, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Norway and Stockholm, Sweden.

In 1938 he lost a leg as the result of a road accident, and thereafter remained in constant pain. In 1954 he returned to the BBC, to present a BBC music request programme for children. He wrote two children's stories, Cornish Adventure (1941) and Cornish Mystery (1950), and gave his name to a series of Ladybird children's books in the 1950s. In 1964 he was the subject of This Is Your Life, by Eamonn Andrews. He died at Haywards Heath, London, on 1 June 1967, at the age of 48. He is buried at St Paul's Cathedral, London. The Bloodgate Scandal was a rugby union scandal involving the English team Harlequins in their Heineken Cup match against the Irish side Leinster on 12 April 2009. It was so called because of the use of fake blood capsules, and has been seen by some as one of the biggest scandals in rugby since professionalisation in the mid-1990s. An investigation by the ERC and the RFU revealed that blood injuries had also been faked on four previous occasions to enable tactical substitutions. These findings resulted in a twelve-montmont-mont investigation, which led to McCulloch's resignation from the BBC in 1950 due to ill health. He has been awarded an OBE in 1964, and was made a CBE in 1966. He also received a knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours List in 1966, and a CBe in 1967. He had a son and a daughter, both of whom are still living in the UK. His great-great-grandchildren are also named Derek McCulloch and Emily McCulloch, and his great-grandson is named David McCulloch. The BBC has published a biography of him, which can be found at: http://www.theweeweb.co.uk/public/author_profile.php/derek-mcculloch-briefing.php?id={id:443}. He was the commentator on the first radio broadcast of the FA Cup Final in 1927. His sign-off line, ""Goodnight children, everywhere,"" became more poignant after the evacuation of many children at the start of the Second World War. Fiddler's Dram were a British folk band of the late 1970s. They are mainly known for their hit single, ""Day Trip to Bangor (Didn't We Have a Lovely Time)"" (1979) The band had an enthusiastic local following and played regularly at local clubs and bars in and around the Canterbury area. The full-time members of the band were drawn from the Oyster Ceilidh Band and were: Cathy Lesurf - vocals, bodhran, Alan Prosser - guitar, fiddle, bowed psaltery, bones. Chris Taylor - bouzouki, harmonica, appalachian dulcimer, mandola, tenor banjo, English Concertina, Will Ward - Bassoon, Recorder, Crumhorn. Dave Arbus, violinist with East of Eden, was a founder member but left long before the band achieved success. David Foer, regular regular Debbie Foers' track, was re-recorded at a faster tempo on the acoustic LP, and augmented by other instruments including b-b-guitar and mandola. The first Fiddler's dram album To See the Play was released on the Dingles label in 1978. It featured acoustic arrangements of British traditional songs, but also included live favourite ""Day trip to Bang or"", written by Debbie Cook. The band's last album was released in 1979. The album was called ""To See The Play"" and was released by the label Dingles Records. It was the first time the band had released an album on a major label, and was the last time they played live at a folk club in Whitstable, Kent. The song was written by David Foers, who was a regular regular at the Whitstable Folk Club in the 1970s and 1980s. The track was ""Didn’t We Have A Lovely Time"" (1979), written by Debbie Cook, and recorded by David Foers and Chris Taylor. It is one of the most popular songs in the history of the British folk scene. Harlequin FC were involved in the 2009 'Bloodgate' rugby union scandal. The scandal centred on a fake blood injury to Tom Williams during a Heineken Cup fixture against Leinster. Dean Richards was given a three-year suspension from coaching as punishment. The International Rugby Board (IRB) also confirmed that they would apply the ban to rugby union worldwide. The club chairman Charles Jillings tendered his resignation. It has been claimed that ""Day Trip To Bangor"" was actually inspired by a day trip to Rhyl (a seaside resort 35 miles east of Bangor, North Wales), but because Bangor had an extra syllable and slipped off the tongue more easily, it was used instead of Rhyl. Songwriter Cook has unconditionally denied this, however  Cook, when interviewed for the BBC Radio 4 documentary, broadcast on 29 September 2011, said the song was ""absolutely yes"" about the Bangor in Wales. The single reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1980, having been released the previous year, and is now available via iTunes. A version of the song, with altered lyrics, was used the following year in a TV commercial for Anchor butter. The band received no royalties for this, and the story was featured on the BBC TV series That's Life!. Also in 1980, a spoof version, "" day Trip To Barnhurst"" by Jackie & The Commuters, was released on a single and much played on Capital Radio though without any chart success. In 2009, Cathy Lesurf released a Christmas single called ""Christmas Time"" She said she hoped it would be a hit so it could be a ""companion"" for ""Day trip to Bangor"". In the words of Ian Telfer, Fiddler's Dram did one more tour then gratefully took the money (and the gold discs) and ran. The Oyster Ceilidh Band continued as both a dance and concert band however, changing their name around 1982 to the Oyster Band and later to just Oysterband. The word harpy means ""that which snatches"" as it comes from the ancient Greek word harpazein (ἁρπάζION), which means ""to snatch"" The word comes from Latin : harpeia, originating in Greek :   harpūia, and means ""lovely women with two-haired bird-women"" in English. The harpies were sisters of Iris, daughters of Thaumas and Electra, a king of Thrace, and a gift of Zeus, who punished him by blinding him with a buffet of food which he could never eat too much. In Greek mythology, a harpy was one of the winged spirits best known for constantly stealing all food from Phineus, and was the mother by the West Wind Zephyros of the horses of Achilles. [1] Harpies are a late development due to confusion with the Byzantine writers and their ugliness. Harpies were agents of punishment who abducted people and tortured them on their way to Tartarus. They lived on the islands of the Strophades and were usually seen as the personifications of the destructive nature of wind. In his Inferno, XIII, Dante envisages the tortured wood infested with harpies, where the suicides have their punishment in the seventh ring of Hell. In Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, Benedick spots the sharp-tongued Beatrice approaching and exclaims to the Prince, Don Pedro, that he would do an assortment of arduous tasks for him ""rather than hold three words conference with this harpy!"" The American Harpy Eagle is a real bird named after the mythological animal. Harpies are commonly depicted as a race of bird-women, such as in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials book series. They appear as a minor enemy throughout the God of War video game series which is loosely based on Greek mythology. The term is often used metaphorically to refer to a nasty or annoying woman. The terms ultimately derive frat and servelat in the Italian-speaking and German-speaking part of Switzerland, Cervelas in French-speaking Switzerland, and Zervela in German. The recipe for cervelat, also called zervelas, is a sausage produced in Switzerland, France, Germany and other parts of Germany and France. The sausages are called cervelus in France and cervelos in Germany and vary in preparation of the regionally called Cervelat or zerVELas in Italy and the German-speakers of the Italian part of the Swiss canton of Tuscany. In the Middle Ages, the harpy, often called the ""virgin eagle"", became a popular charge in heraldry, particularly in East Frisia, seen on, among others, the coats-of-arms of Rietburg, Liechtenstein, and the Cirksena in Italy. The harpy is also mentioned in Peter S. Beagle's novel The Last Unicorn, and is mentioned in the Percy Jackson series. In reality the Harpy is a bird of prey, not a mythical creature. The Harpy in reality is a large, feathered bird called a Harpy-eagle, which can be found in the U.S. state of New Mexico. Cervelat is a Swiss sausage made of beef, pork, bacon, pork rind and ice. The modern Swiss variety is packed into zebu intestines. Some 160 million cervelats weighing 27,000 metric tons are produced in Switzerland annually. The taste of the sausages depends on the region, but generally they are similar to that of a frankfurter, but with a smokier flavour and a texture brought about by its fat shape and the tightly wrapped natural casing. Grilling cervelat over an open fire with the ends cut open so they expand like a butterfly's wings is a childhood memory for nearly every Swiss person; as a result, many Swiss are emotionally attached to the sausage. In 2008, Swiss and German stockpiles of zebi intestines became very low by 2008, threatening production altogether, and causing some controversy in Switzerland. The Swiss government entered into negotiations with the EU to seek an exception for zebo intestines, and Swiss scientists were sent to Brazil to show that the intestines posed no risk of transmitting mad cow disease. By August 2008, most of the Swiss demand had been met, and the Swiss meat industry announced that a national ""cervelat task force"" had failed in an exhaustive search for an acceptable alternative to zebus. The New York Times noted that ""the possible demise of cervelas visibly upset the Swiss, a normally even-tempered people."" In a newspaper poll, 72% of those surveyed said the 'cervelas, as they knew it, had to be saved."" The cervel at crisis was brought up in a parliamentary debate wherein state councillor Rolf Büttiker, spoke of the national sausage's social significance, calling it a ""cult sausage"" and ""the worker's steak"". It was first recorded in 1552 by Rabelais, and is derived from zervelada, a Milanese dialect word meaning  a ""large, short sausage filled with meat and pork brains"" Modern recipes do not include brains, and arose towards the end of the 19th century in Basel, as a reworking of the traditional recipe. The ingredients are finely minced in a cutter, packed into beef intestines and smoked for an hour and then cooked by boiling for a short time. Nana Mouskouri is the biggest-selling female artist of all time. Her fluency in multiple languages enabled her to reach audiences all over Europe, the Americas, and even Asia. Possessed of a distinctive, angelic soprano, she was sometimes described as Europe's answer to Barbra Streisand. Her biggest hit, ""Never on Sunday,"" is presented in its original Greek lyrics as ""Ta Pedia Tou Pirea"" ""Four and Twenty Hours"" is a mature but remarkably catchy slice of AM radio fluff that predicts the sound that ABBA would take to the top of the charts later in the decade. The album's worth depends entirely on the listener's tolerance for this kind of Eurovision Song Contest style of pop, but few people working in this style in the '60s and '70s were better than Nana MousKouri. The double album-length set is a compilation recorded over a span of over a decade with a variety of accompanists ranging from the Athenians to the Mike Sammes Singers, the albums sounds as if it could have been recorded during one lengthy session. The albums are available on Apple Music and other streaming services. For more information on Passport, go to the album's official website or see the album page here. The set includes 21 songs from different nations, including songs from Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay, as well as a selection of her own songs from the '50s, '60, '70, '80s, and '90s, including ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" ""Amazing Grace"" and ""The Loving Song"" The album is out now on iTunes, with a track list to be released in the coming weeks. For the full album list, visit the Apple Music website or the iTunes Store. The full albumlist is available on the website and the track list will be available in the next few weeks, including a video of Mouskouri's ""Never On Sunday"" and a selection from ""Four And Twenty Hours,"" along with a CD of her other songs from that same period. It is also available on Spotify and other services."

Hot Gossip
Hot Gossip (1974–1986) were a British dance troupe, who made television appearances and in 1978 backed Sarah Brightman on her single, ""I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper"". 

Formation

Arlene Phillips moved to London to learn and teach developing American Jazz dance routines. Employed as a dance teacher, she taught at locations including the Pineapple Dance Studios and the Italia Conti Stage School. In 1974, Phillips started forming the core of a troupe; Italia Conti student actress Lesley Manville turned her down. Hot Gossip spent two years performing in Munkberry's club in Jermyn Street W1 where Phillips and manager/producers Michael Summerton and Iain Burton developed the group's dance act. Phillips, Summerton and Burton continued to work together for eight years during which time Hot Gossip continued to enjoy wide popularity and success.

Career

The Kenny Everett Video Show

Spotted by the British television director David Mallet, he invited Phillips to make Hot Gossip a regular feature of the 1978 The Kenny Everett Video Show, which he directed for Thames Television on ITV. The show ended in 1981 on Thames,then moved to the BBC without Hot Gossip except for Season 4 in  1986.Just a few dancing highlights - 'If My Friends Could See Me Now','Supernature',Floyd's Theme',Shaft','Walk On The Wild Side',Stuff Like That',Hot Child In The City',I Feel Love','The Eve Of War','The Hardest Part' and 'Another Brick In The Wall'.

Music

In 1978, during their initial impact period on The Kenny Everett Video Show, Hot Gossip recorded ""Making love on a phone"" and with Sarah Brightman on lead vocals recorded ""I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper"". A disco song written by Jeff Calvert, Geraint Hughes,the men behind another huge hit record in 1975 called 'Barbados'. The track reaching number 6 in the UK Singles Chart,  They went on to record an album in 1981,called Geisha Boys and Temple Girls, produced by the former Human League and then current Heaven 17/BEF member Martyn Ware.A stand out track called 'I Burn For You' was written by Sting. 

The Very Hot Gossip Show

Produced by Burton and Telecast by Channel 4, the one-hour special was a vehicle for Hot Gossip, fresh from their stint on The Kenny Everett Video Show. The Very Hot Gossip Show was one of the highest rating shows for Channel 4 that year.

Style

Hot Gossip were noted for the risque nature of their costumes and the dance routines, all designed and choreographed by Phillips, especially considering the early evening timeslot that the Video Show was broadcast in. They are often credited as one of the UK's early television dance troupes, continuing a trend which started with the Go-Jo's and Pan's People on Top of the Pops.

The group was once spoofed on The Benny Hill Show as Hot Gossamer,with references to the Hot Gossip routines 'Supernature' and 'Walk On The Wild Side'. Some former Hot Gossip dancers appeared on the show,notably Jane Colthorpe and Lorraine Doyle were members of Love Machine.Then later Lorraine Doyle featured heavily in sketches as well as part of the Hill's Angels dance troupe.

Passage:
Helen Sharman
Dr Helen Patricia Sharman OBE FRSC (born 30 May 1963) is a British chemist who became the first British astronaut and the first woman to visit the Mir space station in 1991.

Sharman was born in Grenoside, Sheffield, where she attended Grenoside Junior and Infant School, later moving to Greenhill. After studying at Jordanthorpe Comprehensive, she received a BSc in chemistry at the University of Sheffield in 1984 and a PhD from Birkbeck, University of London. She worked as a research and development technologist for GEC in London and later as a chemist for Mars Incorporated dealing with flavourant properties of chocolate.

Project Juno 

After responding to a radio advertisement asking for applicants to be the first British astronaut, Helen Sharman was selected for the mission live on ITV, on 25 November 1989, ahead of nearly 13,000 other applicants.   The programme was known as Project Juno and was a cooperative Soviet Union–British mission co-sponsored by a group of British companies. 

Sharman was selected in a process that gave weight to scientific, educational and aerospace backgrounds as well as the ability to learn a foreign language.  A lottery was one of several schemes used to raise money to underwrite the cost of the flight.

Before flying, Sharman spent 18 months in intensive flight training in Star City. The Project Juno consortium failed to raise the monies expected, and the programme was almost cancelled. With a view towards the flight's impact on international relations, the project proceeded under Soviet expense although as a cost-saving measure, less expensive experiments were substituted for those in the original plans. 

The Soyuz TM-12 mission, which included Soviet cosmonauts Anatoly Artsebarsky and Sergei Krikalev, launched on 18 May 1991  and lasted eight days, most of that time spent at the Mir space station. Sharman's tasks included medical and agricultural tests,  photographing the British Isles, and participating in an unlicensed amateur radio hookup with British schoolchildren. She landed aboard Soyuz TM-11 on 26 May 1991, along with Viktor Afanasyev and Musa Manarov.

Sharman was 27 years and 11 months old when she went into space, making her () the sixth youngest of the 545 individuals who have flown in space.  Sharman has not returned to space, although she was one of three British candidates in the 1992 European Space Agency astronaut selection process and was on the shortlist of 25 applicants in 1998.

For her Project Juno accomplishments, Sharman received a star on the Sheffield Walk of Fame. 

Later career

Sharman spent the eight  years following her mission to Mir self-employed, communicating science to the public. Her autobiography, Seize the Moment, was published in 1993.  In 1997 she published a children's book, The Space Place.  She has presented radio and television programmes including for BBC Schools.  

By 2011, she was working at the National  Physical  Laboratory as Group Leader of the Surface and Nanoanalysis  Group. Sharman became Operations Manager for the Department of Chemistry at Imperial College London in 2015.   She still does outreach activities related to chemistry and her spaceflight, and was recently awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the British Science Association. 

Awards and honours

In 1991, she was chosen to light the flame at the 1991 Summer Universiade, held in Sheffield. On live international television, she tripped while running through the infield of Don Valley Stadium, sending the burning embers onto the track. Encouraged to continue her run, without any flame from the torch, she proceeded round the track and climbed to the ceremonial flame. Despite the lack of any fire from the torch the ceremonial flame still ignited. 

For her pioneering efforts, Sharman was appointed an OBE in 1993, and the same year an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry. 

The British School in Assen, Netherlands is named the Helen Sharman School after her. In addition there is a house named after her at Wallington High School for Girls, a grammar school in the London Borough of Sutton, where each house is named after a high achieving and influential woman. The science block of BullersWood school, Chislehurst, Kent was opened by Sharman in 1994 and is called Sharman House. There is also a house named after her at Rugby High School for Girls a girls grammar school where houses are named after four influential women, and a Sharman house at Moorlands School, Leeds where houses are named after inspiring people from Yorkshire.

Additionally, a residential development in Stafford in the West Midlands of England has a street named Helen Sharman Drive in her honour

She has received a number of honorary degrees from UK universities, including:

beach bunny [ edit ]
A general American popular culture term for a young woman .who spends her free time at the beach. In surf culture it may also refer to a female surfer. Beach bunnies are known for the amount of time they spend sun tanning and are usually represented wearing bikinis,"" see w:Muscle Beach Party and w:Gidget .
The lowest section of the face of an unbroken wave.
The lower surface of a surfboard.
caught inside [ edit ]
When a surfer is on the ""inside"" and trapped between the shoreline and breaking waves. Oncoming waves can make paddling back outside difficult, hence being ""caught"" in an undesirable position. This usually means the surfer will have to wait for a lull between the larger breaking waves for a chance to slip into clear water.
Caught Inside is also a 1996 book by Daniel Duane about his surfing experiences ( ISBN 0-86547-494-X ).
Design feature of a surfboard to guide water along its underside.
A trench between sand banks or reefs. Often associated with a strong current.
cutback [ edit ]
A classic surfing move used to change direction when streaking ahead of the curl of a wave with a powerful turn back towards the breaking part of the wave (white water). Cutbacks are an important element in surfing as the maneuver repositions the surfer closer to the power of the wave. See also Roundhouse cutback.
Slang for lying down on the board while riding a wave. Derogatory term applied to those who are not good enough to stand up yet.
body boarder
down-the-line [ edit ]
A reference to the direction further along the crest of a wave from the location from where a surfer drops into the wave. The direction toward which the surfer is riding. Waves can also be described as ""down-the-line"" when the wall is long and fast.
Eddie would go [ edit ]
A reference to legendary waterman Eddie Aikau renowned for taking on waves others would shy away from. Eddie went to paddle for help when the Hawaiian ocean voyaging canoe Hokule'a ran into trouble off the Hawaiian island of Kaho'olawe, and was never seen again. This phrase is often seen on bumper stickers throughout Hawai'i.
jacking [ edit ]
A wave condition in which a swell rises very quickly as it passes from deeper water to shallow water. A radical shoaling process caused by an extreme variation in water depth as the swell hits the shallow reef or ocean floor. Often creates very hollow and intense waves that appear to grow suddenly in height; thus ""jacking up"".
jake [ edit ]
( slang , Australia ) A jake, or rockaway jake, is somebody in the line-up and unconsciously causing trouble or problems for their fellow surfers. A jake is usually a beginning surfer and surfers use jake similar to how netizens use newbie. See also kook .
kook [ edit ]
Any person who is in the line-up and unconsciously causing trouble or problems for their fellow surfers. A kook is usually a beginning surfer and surfers use kook similar to how netizens use newbie. Can also be used as an insult. See also jake .
line up [ edit ]
The line up is often mistakenly thought to be the line of surfers waiting for waves just beyond the breaking waves.
The phrase was originally used, and still is, to describe the line a breaking wave follows. From when the wave starts breaking, following the line of the reef or sandbank. The ""line up"" is used to decribe the rideable part of the wave that a surfer will follow. To paddle through the line up is considered to be both dangerous and rude behaviour. This is a mistake often made by many beginner surfers, resulting in frightening near misses or dangerous accidents.
localism [ edit ]
Term given to hostility displayed by local surfers to surfers visiting what the locals consider to be their break. The hostility can range from graffiti, verbal abuse in the line up, wiping of surf wax over the windscreen of the visitor's car, to physical violence (as preferred in Hawai'i allegedly).
stringer [ edit ]
The wooden strip which runs the length of the board, designed to give strength and rigidity to the board. These can either be single, for short boards or lighter weight long boards, or double or triple stringers for longboards. Double and triple stringers are great for using longboards in more powerful or large waves, but add weight to the board.
Stu [ edit ]
( slang , US West Coast) A ""kook"" or a ""barney."" i.e. a new/untalented surfer. Can also refer to local college students who are ignorant of proper surf etiquette and usually of questionable surfing ability. Example: ""watch out for that peak, it's loaded with stu's!""

Passage:
Marron glacé
A marron glacé (plural marrons glacés) is a confection, originating in southern France and northern Italy consisting of a chestnut candied in sugar syrup and glazed. Marrons glacés are an ingredient in many desserts and are also eaten on their own.

History

Candied chestnuts appeared in chestnut-growing areas in northern Italy and southern France shortly after the crusaders returned to Europe with sugar. Cooking with sugar allowed creation of new confectioneries. A candied chestnut confection was probably served around the beginning of the 15th century in Piedmont, among other places.[http://www.vegparadise.com/highestperch211.html Vegetarians in Paradise]. But marrons glacés as such (with the last touch of 'glazing'), may have been created only in the 16th century. Lyon and Cuneo dispute the title for the addition of the glazing, or icing, that makes the real marron glacé.

The earliest known record of a recipe for marron glacés was written by the French at the end of 17th century in Louis XIV's Versailles court. In 1667,  François Pierre La Varenne, ten years' chef de cuisine to Nicolas Chalon du Blé, Marquis of Uxelles (near Lyon and a chestnut-producing area), and foremost figure of the nouvelle cuisine movement of the time, published his best-selling book Le parfaict confiturier. In it he describes ""la façon de faire marron pour tirer au sec"" (""the way to make (a) chestnut (so as) to 'pull it dry'""); this may well be the first record of the recipe for marrons glacés. ""Tirer au sec"" means, in a confectionery context, ""to remove (what's being candied) from the syrup"". La Varenne's book was edited thirty times over seventy-five years.

Nevertheless, that book was not mentioned (nor indeed any other) when the recipe applied to cocoa beans, was in 1694 passed on to Jean-Baptiste Labat, a French missionary in the Martinique. That year Father Labat wrote in a letter of a recipe for candied and iced cocoa beans which he had tasted when dining at a M. Pocquet's. A very detailed letter about an adaptation of the recipe, also with glaze, applied on cocoa beans. Another early citation, still in French, is from 1690. 

Towards the end of 19th century, Lyon was suffering from the collapse of the textile market, notably silk. In the midst of this crisis, Clément Faugier, a bridge and roadworks engineer, was looking for a way to revitalize the regional economy. In 1882 in Privas, Ardèche, he and a local confectioner set up the first factory with the technology to produce marrons glacés industrially (though many of the nearly twenty steps necessary from harvest to finished product are still performed manually). Three years later he introduced the crème de marrons de l'Ardèche, a sweetened chestnut purée made from marrons glacés broken during the production process, flavoured with vanilla. (later came Marrons au Cognac in 1924, Purée de Marrons Nature in 1934, Marrons au Naturel in 1951, and Marpom's in 1994.)

The same process was used by José Posada in Ourense (Spain) in 1980. He was the first businessman in Spain to build a factory to produce Spanish marrons glacés using Galician raw chestnuts, which previously were exported to France to produce the confectionary. Posada used the French and Italian formula to produce the marrons glacés. Today, there are two factories that produce marrons glacés in Spain.

Châtaigne or marron

The French refer to chestnuts as châtaigne or marron. Both terms refer to the fruit of the sweet chestnut Castanea sativa. However, marron tends to denote a higher quality, larger fruit that is more easily peeled. The fifth edition of the dictionary Dictionnaire de l'Académie françoise. Revu, corrigé et augmenté published in 1798 states that a marron glacé is a confit marron that is covered in caramel.  The 1767 book L'agronome, ou dictionnaire portatif du cultivateur claimed that the best marrons came from the Dauphiné region in southeastern France, and contained instructions for preparing marron glacés. 

Chestnuts are covered with a membrane, known as a pellicle or episperm, which closely adheres to the fruit's flesh and must be removed because of its astringency. Marron nuts have a pellicle which is ""superficially attached to the nut"", making it easily removable from the fruit. Some chestnuts have two cotyledons usually separated with deep grooves penetrating nearly all the way through the fruit; this makes them too fragile for the necessary manipulations during the cooking process. There also are other grooves on the surface, which means more embedded pellicle that must be painstakingly removed. ""Marron""-quality nuts do not have the separation into two cotyledons; it appears in one piece and it shows few very shallow grooves.

In Italy, the term marron denotes a specific high-quality cultivar of Castanea sativa bearing oblong fruits with a shiny, reddish epicarp and often exhibiting a small rectangular hilar scar. As with the French use of the term, there should be no division of the cotyledons.

Marron-quality nuts for marrons glacés may be three or four times more expensive than the châtaigne because they also have a lower yield as the husk usually contains only one or two nuts and the plants have sterile male flowers.

Uses

Marrons glacés may be eaten on their own.

Crème de marrons are a staple ingredient for other desserts, such as the Mont Blanc (puréed with cream), ice creams, cakes, sweet sauce or garnish for other desserts.

Cultural references

In the short story Reginald (1901) by Saki, the narrator leaves Reginald ""near a seductive dish of marrons glacés"" at a garden-party in the vain hope that these delicacies will distract him from wreaking social havoc.

In the Overture to Swann's Way, Marcel Proust refers to M. Swann bringing to Marcel's great-aunt on New Year's Day a little packet of marrons glacés.

In Patrick Skene Catling's children's book, ""The Chocolate Touch,"" marrons glacés are among the candies listed as the sweet-toothed young protagonist's favorite confectionary delights.

Turkey

Candied chestnuts are a speciality of Bursa, Turkey, where they are called kestane șekeri 'chestnut candy'.

Passage:
Organ (anatomy)
In biology, an organ or viscus is a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to serve a common function.  In anatomy, a viscus is an internal organ, and viscera is the plural form.   

Organs are composed of main tissue, parenchyma, and ""sporadic"" tissues, stroma. The main tissue is that which is unique for the specific organ, such as the myocardium, the main tissue of the heart, while sporadic tissues include the nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissues. Functionally related organs often cooperate to form whole organ systems. Organs exist in all higher biological organisms, in particular they are not restricted to animals, but can also be identified in plants. In single-cell organisms like bacteria, the functional analogue of an organ is called organelle. 

A hollow organ is a visceral organ that forms a hollow tube or pouch, such as the stomach or intestine, or that includes a cavity, like the heart or urinary bladder.

Organ systems 

Two or more organs working together in the execution of a specific body function form an organ system, also called a biological system or body system. The functions of organ systems often share significant overlap. For instance, the nervous and endocrine system both operate via a shared organ, the hypothalamus. For this reason, the two systems are combined and studied as the neuroendocrine system. The same is true for the musculoskeletal system because of the relationship between the muscular and skeletal systems.

Mammals such as humans have a variety of organ systems. These specific systems are also widely studied in human anatomy.
* Cardiovascular system: pumping and channeling blood to and from the body and lungs with heart, blood and blood vessels.
* Digestive system: digestion and processing food with salivary glands, esophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, intestines, colon, rectum and anus.
* Endocrine system: communication within the body using hormones made by endocrine glands such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, pineal body or pineal gland, thyroid, parathyroids and adrenals, i.e., adrenal glands.
* Excretory system: kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra involved in fluid balance, electrolyte balance and excretion of urine.
* Lymphatic system: structures involved in the transfer of lymph between tissues and the blood stream, the lymph and the nodes and vessels that transport it including the Immune system: defending against disease-causing agents with leukocytes, tonsils, adenoids, thymus and spleen.
* Integumentary system: skin, hair and nails.
* Muscular system: movement with muscles.
* Nervous system: collecting, transferring and processing information with brain, spinal cord and nerves.
* Reproductive system: the sex organs, such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, mammary glands, testes, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate and penis.
* Respiratory system: the organs used for breathing, the pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs and diaphragm.
* Skeletal system: structural support and protection with bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons.

Other animals

The organ level of organisation in animals can be first detected in flatworms and the more advanced phyla. The less-advanced taxons (like Placozoa, Porifera and Radiata) do not show consolidation of their tissues into organs.

Plants

The study of plant organs is referred to as plant morphology, rather than anatomy, as in animal systems. Organs of plants can be divided into vegetative and reproductive. Vegetative plant organs are roots, stems, and leaves. The reproductive organs are variable. In flowering plants, they are represented by the flower, seed and fruit. In conifers, the organ that bears the reproductive structures is called a cone. In other divisions (phyla) of plants, the reproductive organs are called strobili, in Lycopodiophyta, or simply gametophores in mosses.

The vegetative organs are essential for maintaining the life of a plant. While there can be 11 organ systems in animals, there are far fewer in plants, where some perform the vital functions, such as photosynthesis, while the reproductive organs are essential in reproduction. However, if there is asexual vegetative reproduction, the vegetative organs are those that create the new generation of plants (see clonal colony).

History

Etymology

The English word ""organ"" derives from the Latin ', meaning ""instrument"", itself from the Greek word , ' (""implement; musical instrument; organ of the body""). The Greek word is related to , ' (""work"").Barnhart's Concise Dictionary of Etymology The viscera, when removed from a butchered animal, are known collectively as offal. Internal organs are also informally known as ""guts"" (which may also refer to the gastrointestinal tract), or more formally, ""innards"".

Aristotle used the word frequently in his philosophy, both to describe the organs of plants or animals (e.g. the roots of a tree, the heart or liver of an animal), and to describe more abstract ""parts"" of an interconnected whole (e.g. his philosophical works, taken as a whole, are referred to as the ""organon"").

The English word ""organism"" is a neologism coined in the 17th century, probably formed from the verb to organize. At first the word referred to an organization or social system. The meaning of a living animal or plant is first recorded in 1842. Plant organs are made from tissue built up from different types of tissue. When there are three or more organs it is called an organ system. 

The adjective visceral, also splanchnic, is used for anything pertaining to the internal organs. Historically, viscera of animals were examined by Roman pagan priests like the haruspices or the augurs in order to divine the future by their shape, dimensions or other factors. This practice remains an important ritual in some remote, tribal societies.

The term ""visceral"" is contrasted with the term """", meaning ""of or relating to the wall of a body part, organ or cavity"". The two terms are often used in describing a membrane or piece of connective tissue, referring to the opposing sides.

7 Vital Organs of Antiquity

Some alchemists (e.g. Paracelsus) adopted the Hermetic Qabalah assignment between the 7 vital organs and the 7 Classical planets as follows:

She has not returned to space, although she was one of three British candidates in the 1992 European Space Agency astronaut selection process. Sharman spent the eight years following her mission to Mir self-employed, communicating science to the public. Her autobiography, Seize the Moment, was published in 1993. In 1997 she published a children's book, The Space Place. By 2011, she was working at the National Physical Laboratory as Group Leader of the Surface and Nanoanalysis Group. She still does outreach activities related to chemistry and her spaceflight, and was recently awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the British Science Association. The British School in Assen, Netherlands is named the Helen Sharman School after her. There is a house named after her at Wallington High School for Girls, a grammar school in the London Borough of Sutton, where each house is named after a high achieving and influential woman.

Marron glacé (plural marrons glacés) is a confection, originating in southern France and northern Italy. It is a chestnut candied in sugar syrup and glazed. Marrons glacé is an ingredient in many desserts and are also eaten on their own. The earliest known record of a recipe for marron glacés was written by the French at the end of 17th century in Louis XIV's Versailles court. In 1882 in Privas, Ardèche, he and a local confectioner set up the first factory with the technology to produce marrons Glacés industrially. The same process was used by José Posada in Ourense (Spain) in 1980. He was the first businessman in Spain to build a factory to produce Spanish marrons glaciersés using Galician raw chestnuts, which previously were exported to France to produce the confectionary. Today, there are two factories that produce marons glacés in Spain. Both terms refer to the French fruit of the same name: châtaigne or marron satane. The French word marron refers to a larger, larger fruit that is more easily peeled. The Spanish term marron sitsane refers to the fruit of a higher quality, larger, higher-quality fruit. The fifth edition of the Dictionnaire de l'Académie Revérigu, corémie françoise, Revémie de lçoise Revémagné et Revélique, published in 1798, states that a marron confité is a. confection that is covered in confectionery that is not covered in sugar. A marron sitane is a sweetened chestnut purée made from a broken piece of chestnut that is broken during the production process, flavoured with vanilla. The first record of the recipe is from 1694, when Jean-Baptiste Labat, a French missionary in the Martinique, wrote in a letter of a. recipe for candied and iced cocoa beans which he had tasted when dining at a M. Pocquet's. The recipe was not mentioned (nor indeed any other) when the recipe applied to cocoa beans, was in 1694. The last touch of 'glazing', may have been created only in the 16th century, when the French chef de cuisine François Pierre La Varenne published his best-selling book Le parfaict confiturier. In it he describes ""la façon de faire marron pour tirer au sec"" Marron nuts have a pellicle which is ""superficially attached to the nut"", making it easily removable from the fruit. Marron-quality nuts for marrons glacés may be three or four times more expensive than the châtaigne because they have a lower yield. The term marron denotes a specific high-quality cultivar of Castanea sativa bearing oblong fruits with a shiny, reddish epicarp and often exhibiting a small rectangular hilar scar. In biology, an organ or viscus is a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to serve a common function. Organs exist in all higher biological organisms, in particular they are not restricted to animals, but can also be identified in plants. In single-cell organisms like bacteria, the functional analogue of an organ is called organelle. The nervous and endocrine systems of humans share significant overlap. The same is true for the musculoskeletal system because the relationship between the muscular and skeletal systems is the same for humans as it is for animals. For instance, the hypothalamus and hypothalamus are combined and studied as the hypothalamic and neuroendocrine system. The specific body system of humans is called a body system or biological system or body system. In the short story Reginald (1901) by Saki, the narrator leaves a seductive dish of marrons Glacés at a garden-party in the vain hope that these delicacies will distract him from wreaking social havoc. In Patrick Skene Catling's children's book, ""The Chocolate Touch,"" marron glacés are among the candies listed as the sweet-toothed young protagonist's favorite confectionary delights. In Turkey, candied chestnuts are a speciality of Bursa, Turkey, where they are called kestane șekeri 'chestnut candy' They are a staple ingredient for other desserts, such as the Mont Blanc (puréed with cream), ice creams, cakes, sweet sauce or garnish for otheresserts. In Italy, they are known as'marrons' or'marmons' and can be eaten on their own as well as as part of a meal. In France, the term'marron' is used to refer to a specific type of nut, which can be found in the Dauphiné. ariety of organ systems. These specific systems are also widely studied in human anatomy. While there can be 11 organ systems in animals, there are far fewer in plants. The study of plant organs is referred to as plant morphology, rather than anatomy. Organs of plants can be divided into vegetative and reproductive. The word ""organ"" derives from the Latin ', meaning ""instrument"", itself from the Greek word'(""implement; musical instrument; organ of the body""). The Greek word is related to,'(""work""). The viscera, when removed from a butchered animal, are known collectively as offal. Internal organs are also informally known as ""guts"" (which may also refer to the gastrointestinal tract), or more formally, ""innards"". Aristotle used the word frequently in his philosophy, both to describe the organs of plants or animals (e.g. the roots of a tree, the heart or liver of an animal), and to describe more abstract ""parts"" of an interconnected whole. The first word referred to an organ system is coined in the 17th century. At 42, the organization or social organization of a living animal is first recorded in 1842. When there are three or more organs, it is called an organsystem. When it is an organ of tissue, the word is called 'organon' The word 'organism' is a neologism, probably formed from the verb to organize, meaning ""organism"" or ""organ system"" The English word is also used to refer to an animal system, meaning 'organ or system' or 'organ of animal' It is also the name of a type of animal, a species of fish, a bird, a mammal, a reptile, a fish species and a bird of prey. It is the first word used in the English language to describe an animal or plant system, as well as the word for the organ of a bird or a fish, the ""organon"" The word for a plant system is 'organ', which is also known as 'organ on a tree' or the 'organ' of a fish or a mammal. It means 'organ, organ, organ', or the organ that bears the reproductive structures is called a cone. In conifers, the organs that bear reproductive structures are called strobili, or simply gametophores in mosses. The term ""visceral"" is contrasted with the term """", meaning ""of or relating to the wall of a body part, organ or cavity"" The two terms are often used in describing a membrane or piece of connective tissue, referring to the opposing sides. Historically, viscera of animals were examined by Roman pagan priests like the haruspices or the augurs in order to divine the future by their shape, dimensions or other factors. Some alchemists (e.g. Paracelsus) adopted the Hermetic Qabalah assignment between the 7 vital organs and the 7 Classical planets."

Plot

Convicted of murder at age 13, Bill Clark is freed after 18 years behind bars. He meets a taxi dancer, Catherine Higgins, but when her New York City police detective boyfriend George Conover catches them together, Bill is knocked out. When he awakens, Conover has been shot.

Bill knows the cops will come after him. He doesn't realize Catherine's the one who shot her boyfriend. She volunteers to go with him and they hitch-hike to California, falling in love along the way. They accompany the Dawson family to the lettuce fields of Salinas, where they find honest work and happiness, changing their identities.

A reporter's article about Clark is found by the Dawsons, who need money badly and turn in Bill for a reward. But back in New York, police reveal that before Conover died, he confessed that Catherine shot him in self-defense. She and Bill are cleared to resume their lives.

Reception

Critical response

Film critic Dennis Schwartz seemed disappointed with the film, writing ""Gloomy minor film noir with a happy ending. The movie was made for John Garfield, but he died in 1951. A satisfactory Steve Cochran takes the part and gives it his best shot. Competently directed by Felix Feist (The Devil Thumbs a Ride/The Threat/Donovan's Brain), as always, and adequately written by Guy Endore (blacklisted after the movie for his political activism) and Art Cohn. Though watchable, the social conscious film remains forgettable--unable to leave a particularly sympathetic lasting impression of its outsider characters, whose distrust of the authorities leads them to be anti-social types and humorless downers for most of the pic.""

Petrology
Petrology (from the Greek πέτρος, pétros, ""rock"" and λόγος, lógos, ""subject matter"", see -logy) is the branch of geology that studies the origin, composition, distribution and structure of rocks.

Lithology was once approximately synonymous with petrography, but in current usage, lithology focuses on macroscopic hand-sample or outcrop-scale description of rocks while petrography is the speciality that deals with microscopic details.

In the petroleum industry, lithology, or more specifically mud logging, is the graphic representation of geological formations being drilled through, and drawn on a log called a mud log. As the cuttings are circulated out of the borehole they are sampled, examined (typically under a 10× microscope) and tested chemically when needed.

Methodology

Petrology utilizes the fields of mineralogy, petrography, optical mineralogy, and chemical analysis to describe the composition and texture of rocks. Petrologists also include the principles of geochemistry and geophysics through the study of geochemical trends and cycles and the use of thermodynamic data and experiments in order to better understand the origins of rocks.

Branches 

There are three branches of petrology, corresponding to the three types of rocks: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary, and another dealing with experimental techniques:

*Igneous petrology focuses on the composition and texture of igneous rocks (rocks such as granite or basalt which have crystallized from molten rock or magma). Igneous rocks include volcanic and plutonic rocks.
*Sedimentary petrology focuses on the composition and texture of sedimentary rocks (rocks such as sandstone, shale, or limestone which consist of pieces or particles derived from other rocks or biological or chemical deposits, and are usually bound together in a matrix of finer material).
*Metamorphic petrology focuses on the composition and texture of metamorphic rocks (rocks such as slate, marble, gneiss, or schist which started out as sedimentary or igneous rocks but which have undergone chemical, mineralogical or textural changes due to extremes of pressure, temperature or both)
*Experimental petrology employs high-pressure, high-temperature apparatus to investigate the geochemistry and phase relations of natural or synthetic materials at elevated pressures and temperatures. Experiments are particularly useful for investigating rocks of the lower crust and upper mantle that rarely survive the journey to the surface in pristine condition. They are also one of the prime sources of information about completely inaccessible rocks such as those in the Earth's lower mantle and in the mantles of the other terrestrial planets and the Moon. The work of experimental petrologists has laid a foundation on which modern understanding of igneous and metamorphic processes has been built.
Question:
'Petrology' is the study of the origin, structure and composition of what?
Answer:
The rock

Holy city
Holy city is a term applied to many cities, all of them central to the history or faith of specific religions. Such cities may also contain at least one headquarters complex (often containing a religious edifice, seminary, shrine, residence of the leading cleric of the religion and/or chambers of the religious leadership's offices) which constitutes a major destination of human traffic, or pilgrimage to the city, especially for major ceremonies and observances. A holy city is a symbolic city, representing attributes beyond its natural characteristics. Marketing experts have suggested that holy cities may be the oldest brands, and more specifically, place brands because they have value added via the perception of religious adherents. 

List

These cities include:

Africa

* Abydos (Ancient Egyptian religion)
* Aksum (Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church)
* Alexandria (Coptic Orthodox Church)
* Heliopolis (Ancient Egyptian religion)
* Nkamba (Kimbanguism)
* Ife (Yoruba religion)
* Kairouan (Sufi Islam)
* Lalibela (Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church)
* Moulay Idriss (Islam)

Passage:
Tommy Johnson (musician)
Tommy Johnson (1896 – November 1, 1956) was an influential American Delta blues musician who recorded in the late 1920s and was known for his eerie falsetto voice and intricate guitar playing. 

Early life

Johnson was born near Terry, Mississippi, and moved around 1910 to Crystal Springs, where he lived for most of his life. 
He learned to play the guitar and, by 1914, was supplementing his income by playing at local parties with his brothers Major and LeDell. In 1916 he married and moved to Webb Jennings' plantation near Drew, Mississippi, close to the Dockery Plantation. There he met other musicians, including Charlie Patton and Willie Brown.[http://www.nps.gov/history/delta/blues/people/tommy_johnson.htm ] 

Career

By 1920 Johnson was an alcoholic and an itinerant musician, based in Crystal Springs but traveling widely around the South, sometimes accompanied by Papa Charlie McCoy. In 1928 he made his first recordings, with McCoy, for Victor Records, including ""Canned Heat Blues"", in which he sang of drinking methanol from the cooking fuel Sterno. The song features the refrain ""canned heat, mama, sure, Lord, killing me."" The blues group Canned Heat took their name from this song. Johnson's ""Big Road Blues"" inspired Canned Heat's song ""On the Road Again"". A significantly different version of the song appears as ""Canned Heat"" on the album Big Road Blues by K. C. Douglas.

Johnson recorded two further sessions, for Victor in August 1928 and for Paramount Records in December 1929. He did not record again, mistakenly believing that he had signed away his right to record. Some suggest he had been intentionally given this misimpression by people at Paramount Records. This resulted in a legal settlement with the Mississippi Sheiks, who had used the melody of Johnson's ""Big Road Blues"" in their successful ""Stop and Listen"". Johnson was party to the copyright settlement but was too drunk at the time to understand what he had signed. 

Johnson's recordings established him as the premier Delta blues vocalist of his day, with a powerful voice that could go from a growl to a falsetto. He was an accomplished guitarist. He also performed tricks with his guitar, playing it between his legs and behind his head and throwing it in the air while playing.

His style influenced later blues singers, such as Robert Nighthawk and Howlin' Wolf (whose song ""I Asked for Water [She Brought Me Gasoline]"" was based on Johnson's ""Cool Water Blues""), and the country singer Hank Williams. Johnson was a talented composer, blending fragments of folk poetry and personalized lyrics into set guitar accompaniments to craft striking blues compositions such as ""Maggie Campbell"". 

To enhance his fame, Johnson cultivated a sinister persona. According to his brother LeDell, he claimed to have sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads in exchange for his mastery of the guitar.Evans, David (1971). Tommy Johnson. Studio Vista. p. 22. ISBN 978-0289701515. This story was later also associated with Robert Johnson, to whom Tommy Johnson was unrelated.

Johnson remained a popular performer in the Jackson area through the 1930s and 1940s, sometimes performing with Ishman Bracey. He influenced other performers, partly because he was willing to teach his style and his repertoire. His influence on local traditions is described by David Evans in Tommy Johnson and Big Road Blues: Tradition and Creativity in the Folk Blues. 

Death

Johnson died of a heart attack after playing at a party in 1956. He is buried in the Warm Springs Methodist Church Cemetery, outside Crystal Springs, Mississippi. In 2001 his family commissioned a headstone through the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund, a Mississippi nonprofit corporation; it was paid for by the musician Bonnie Raitt. The large granite memorial, engraved with Johnson's portrait, was not placed on his grave for several years afterward, however, because of a dispute between Johnson's family (led by his niece, Vera Johnson Collins), the owners of farm property encircling the cemetery, and the Copiah County Board of Supervisors over a deteriorated road to the burial site. The dispute was resolved in October 2012, when it was announced that the headstone would be erected on October 26.  The headstone had been on public display in the Crystal Springs Public Library since being unveiled on October 20, 2001. On the night of Saturday, February 2, 2013, the headstone was desecrated, apparently smashed by a sledge hammer or some similar device. 

An annual Tommy Johnson Blues Festival is held in Crystal Springs on the third weekend in October. The inaugural festival was held in Jackson and Crystal Springs in 2006. 

In fiction

In the film O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), a character named Tommy Johnson, played by Chris Thomas King, describes selling his soul to the devil to play guitar. The Tommy Johnson character in the film plays a number of songs originally recorded by the blues musician Skip James and accompanies the Soggy Bottom Boys, a band consisting of the film's three main protagonists plus Johnson, on ""Man of Constant Sorrow"".

The story of Johnson's selling his soul to the devil was first told by his brother, LaDell Johnson, and reported by David Evans in his 1971 biography of Johnson. This legend was subsequently attributed to the blues musician Robert Johnson.

Question:
Which Californian blues-influenced boogie rock band of the 1960's took their name from the title of a Tommy Johnson blues hit of 1928 that told the story of an alcoholic who had desperately turned to drinking cooking fuel?
Answer:
'CANNED HEAT'
Passage:
Fathom
A fathom is a unit of length in the imperial and the U.S. customary systems equal to 6 feet (1.8288 metres), used especially for measuring the depth of water.

There are two yards (6 feet) in an imperial fathom.Encyclopædia Britannica eleventh edition 1911. Originally based on the distance between a man's outstretched arms, the size of a fathom has varied slightly depending on whether it was defined as a thousandth of an (Admiralty) nautical mile or as a multiple of the imperial yard.  Formerly, the term was used for any of several units of length varying around 5 -.

The name derives from the Old English word fæðm, corresponding to the Old High German word ""fadum"" meaning embracing arms or a pair of outstretched arms.Oxford English Dictionary, second edition, 1989;    In Middle English it was fathme.
A cable length, based on the length of a ship's cable, has been variously reckoned as equal to 100 or 120 fathoms. At one time, a quarter meant one-fourth of a fathom.

International fathom 

One  fathom is equal to:
* 1.8288 metres exactly (1 metre is about 0.5468 fathoms) 
* 2 yards (1 yard is exactly 1/2 of a fathom)
* 6 feet (1 foot is exactly 1/6 of a fathom)
* 18 hands
* 72 inches

In the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom defined the length of the international yard to be exactly 0.9144 metre. With the adoption of the metric SI system the use of fathoms declined.

British fathom

The British Admiralty defined a fathom to be a thousandth of an imperial nautical mile (which was 6080 ft) or . In practice the ""warship fathom"" of exactly 6 ft was used in Britain and the United States. No conflict in the real world existed as depths on Imperial nautical charts were indicated in feet if less than 30 ft and in fathoms for depths above that. Until the 19th century in England, the length of the fathom was more variable: from 5½ feet on merchant vessels to either 5 ft or 7 ft on fishing vessels (from ).Fenna (2000: 88-89)

Use of the fathom

Water depth

Most modern nautical charts indicate depth in metres. However, the U.S. Hydrographic Office uses feet and fathoms.  A nautical chart will always explicitly indicate the units of depth used.

To measure the depth of shallow waters, boatmen used a sounding line containing fathom points, some marked and others in between, called deeps, unmarked but estimated by the user.  Water near the coast and not too deep to be fathomed by a hand sounding line was referred to as in soundings or on soundings.  The area offshore beyond the 100 fathom line, too deep to be fathomed by a hand sounding line, was referred to as out of soundings or off soundings.  A deep-sea lead, the heaviest of sounding leads, was used in water exceeding 100 fathoms in depth. 

This technique has been superseded by sonic depth finders for measuring mechanically the depth of water beneath a ship, one version of which is the Fathometer (trademark).  The record made by such a device is a fathogram.  A fathom line or fathom curve, a usually sinuous line on a nautical chart, joins all points having the same depth of water, thereby indicating the contour of the ocean floor. 

Line length

The components of a commercial fisherman's setline were measured in fathoms. The rope called a groundline, used to form the main line of a setline, was usually provided in bundles of 300 fathoms. A single 50-fathom skein (300 ft) of this rope was referred to as a line. Especially in Pacific coast fisheries the setline was composed of units called ""skates"", each consisting of several hundred fathoms of groundline, with gangions and hooks attached. A tuck seine or tuck net about 70 fathoms long (420 ft), and very deep in the middle, was used to take fish from a larger seine.

A line attached to a whaling harpoon was about 150 fathoms long (900 ft). A forerunner — a piece of cloth tied on a ship's log line some fathoms from the outboard end — marked the limit of drift line. A kite was a drag, towed under water at any depth up to about 40 fathoms, which upon striking bottom, was upset and rose to the surface.

A shot, one of the forged lengths of chain joined by shackles to form an anchor cable, was usually 15 fathoms long (90 ft). 

A shackle, a length of cable or chain equal to 12.5 fathoms or 75 feet.  In 1949, the British navy redefined the shackle to be 15 fathoms.

In Finland, fathom (syli) is sometimes, albeit seldom, used as a maritime unit,  of a nautical mile and  of cable length.

Burial

It is customary, when burying the dead, to inter the corpse at a fathom's depth, or six feet under. A burial at sea (where the body is weighted to force it to the bottom) requires a minimum of six fathoms of water. This is the origin of the phrase ""to deep six"" as meaning to discard, or dispose of. 

A similar sentiment is expressed in The Tempest, where a character is told ""Full fathom five thy father lies"".

On land

Until early in the 20th century, it was the unit used to measure the depth of mines (mineral extraction) in the United Kingdom.  Miners also use it as a unit of area equal to 6 sqft in the plane of a vein. In Britain, it can mean the quantity of wood in a pile of any length measuring 6 ft square in cross section. 
In Hungary square fathom (""négyszögöl"") is still in use as an unofficial measure of land area, primarily for small lots suitable for construction.

Former Nazi guard, 89, faces mass murder trial — RT News
Former Nazi guard, 89, faces mass murder trial — RT News
Tags Crime , Hate crimes
Demjanjuk will be tried for assisting in the killing of Jews at the Sobibor extermination camp in Poland during World War Two.
The U.S. Court of Appeal dismissed the 89-year-old’s claims that moving him to Germany would amount to torture because of his poor health.
""Based on the medical information before the court … the court cannot find that the petitioner's removal to Germany is likely to cause irreparable harm sufficient to warrant a stay of removal,"" the court announced.
Prosecutors said that Demjanjuk’s torture arguments sound ridiculous as there are medical assessments and videos showing him to be in good health and able to walk without help.
Demjanjuk’s family is considering an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. It has also filed a lawsuit in Germany to prevent his extradition.
""Given the history of this case and no evidence of his personal involvement in even one assault, let alone a murder, this is inhuman, even if a court says it is lawful,"" Demjanjuk’s son John Demjanjuk was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying.
Demjanjuk was a Soviet Red Army soldier when he was captured by the Nazis in 1942.
After being trained by the Germans at Treblinka, he served two years in the camps of Sobibor and Majdanek in Nazi-occupied Poland and then in Flossenburg in Bavaria, Germany.
He emigrated to the USA in 1952 with his family and settled in Ohio, changing his name from Ivan to John.
Demjanjuk was deported to Israel from the US and sentenced to death in 1988, accused of being a sadistic Nazi guard nicknamed ""Ivan the Terrible"". But Israel's highest court later ruled that he was not the man in question.
After spending years in an Israeli prison, he returned to his home near Cleveland in 1993 and his citizenship was restored in 1998.
U.S. Justice Department Nazi hunters reopened the case when new evidence came to light after the collapse of the Soviet Union. And a U.S. court convicted him in 2002 of working at three other camps.
Demjanjuk was stripped of his citizenship a second time. Then German prosecutors began efforts to put him on trial.
Despite all the accusations, Demjanjuk maintains that he was forced to work in the camps. He says holocaust survivors have mistaken him for other, cruel camp guards.
Question:
Who was deported from the US aged 89 to face a war crime trial in Germany?
Answer:
John Demjanuk
Passage:
Nick Stone (character)
Nick Stone is the main fictional character in a series of books written by Andy McNab, who is an ex-member of British Army regiment the SAS. Andy McNab has written about Nick Stone in seventeen different books. Nick has undertaken many missions including kidnapping a powerful Russian Mafia lord and killing a money-laundering Algerian business man.

Nick Stone left the SAS in 1988, soon after the shooting of three IRA volunteers in Gibraltar. Once working for British Intelligence as a 'K' on deniable operations, he also briefly worked for an American agency. Now he roams the world as somewhat of a mercenary just trying to keep his head above water. Early novels are accounts of assassination and intrigue filled with tradecraft and detail. Later novels, while still detailed, deal with more social topics such as White slavery/prostitution, government corruption, war profiteering, Human rights and torture with Nick never having answers to these complicated topics, but normally just bearing witness.

Biography

Nick Stone's story is depicted as a traumatic one. He grew up in England with parents who he feels did not care about him. They hardly ever spent family time together, and they never did anything to make his childhood happy. His father is also suggested to have been a very violent man, and certain passages hint that Nick was a victim of child abuse at his hand (one passage says that his father locked him in the garden shed on a stormy night and left him there, in the dark and on his own, until the morning). Another says that his stepfather used to beat him, just because he liked to do it. His mother did nothing to stop this abuse, Stone stating that all she did was let it happen, then give him a Mars Bar afterwards. Nick treated his home as a waiting room until he could leave and, when he finally did, he signed up to the Army, eventually being recruited into the SAS. The characters' name and early years were allegedly based on those of a teenage acquaintance of McNab last known working a postman in Dartford.

In Remote Control he is asked if he is still married to which he replies 'no I divorced her', she is also mentioned in subsequent novels as a gauge on women's effect on him, such as references in Crisis Four where his newfound love for fellow operative Sarah is listed on his file at MI6 for the reason he divorced his wife.

After the murder of a fellow SAS soldier and his family, Nick becomes the sole guardian of their seven-year-old daughter Kelly, and the two went on the run from unidentified pursuers, unaware of who was the real target. In Dark Winter, Stone unearths a doomsday threat against the populations of New York, London and Berlin and finds himself facing an unspeakable trade-off; the life of someone he loves, against those of millions he doesn't even know.

In 1987, Stone was involved with a mission in Gibraltar to prevent three PIRA members from detonating a bomb there. This mission involving Stone is a reenactment of the actual event, Operation Flavius. This ended with the shooting in public of all three PIRA officials. This event drove Nick to retire from the SAS at some point between then and 1995. He says in Aggressor that his last job with the Regiment was supervising and being actively involved in the infamous Waco siege in 1993, he also refers to carrying out operations in the Gulf War in some of his books, mirroring Andy McNab's own SAS career. It seems he was being used for unofficial jobs by British Intelligence as early as 1995, as the character Sarah in Crisis Four encouraged him to approach them

He has had many chapters in his life and led a path that has taken him all over the world (including The Congo, Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Southern France, Ireland, Ulster, Switzerland, Malaysia, Georgia, Great Britain, the USA, Syria, Algeria, Libya, Italy, Dubai, Russia, Gibraltar, Finland, Moldova and Denmark), mostly under order of ""The Firm"" but others out of pure bad luck or personal quests for revenge or escapism.

Passage:
Ricky Wilson (singer)
Charles Richard ""Ricky"" Wilson (born 17 January 1978) is an English singer-songwriter. He is known as the lead singer of Kaiser Chiefs, a five-piece band from Menston and Guiseley in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Their successful songs include ""Ruby"", ""I Predict a Riot"", ""Never Miss a Beat"", ""Oh My God"", ""Everyday I Love You Less and Less"", and ""Coming Home"".

Before the formation of the Kaiser Chiefs in 2003, Wilson was a member of the band Runston Parva (later known as Parva) which consisted of members of Kaiser Chiefs.

On 19 September 2013, Wilson was confirmed as a coach on The Voice UK. He was the winning coach for both the fourth and fifth series of the show, being the only coach to win two years consecutively. It was announced that the fifth series would be his last in late 2015.

Life and career

Wilson was born in Keighley, West Yorkshire. He attended Leeds Grammar School after Ghyll Royd primary school. He later attended Leeds Metropolitan University and completed his BA (Hons) degree in Graphic Arts and Design in 2000.  He then taught at Leeds College of Art for a year before the band's big break. 

During the early days of Kaiser Chiefs, Wilson was well known for wearing stripy blazers, waistcoats, turn-up jeans, and winkle picker shoes, a style that won him the Shockwaves NME Award For Best Dressed Person in 2006.  Lately, he has adopted a more casual dress code.

Wilson is well known for his energetic stage presence, climbing scaffolding, standing on the safety barrier, and at times crowd surfing. Of crowd surfing, Wilson says he likes to ""get out and see the crowd, see what they smell like"".  Such exploits have occasionally resulted in injury, such as torn ankle ligaments after jumping off stage during a concert in Portugal. 

In May 2006, Wilson was involved in a hit-and-run accident in his home town of Leeds. He was hit by the car while attempting to walk over a pedestrian crossing, suffering only bruising and a broken toe owing to a 'Ricky trademark jump' which resulted in him hitting the windscreen and being flipped over the top of the vehicle rather than trapped underneath. 

Other works

Wilson has twice been a guest on the BBC Two television show, Never Mind the Buzzcocks, firstly in 2005 as a panellist and then as a guest host in 2006. He also featured on the panel of the BBC Television comedy series, Shooting Stars, in 2009.

In 2008, he appeared in Peter Kay's talent show parody, Peter Kay's Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice, in a duet with the show's protagonist, Geraldine McQueen.

Wilson had a minor role in St Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold, as the rock star boyfriend of Sarah Harding's character, Roxy.

In 2010, he appeared in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 in a background role as Dirk Cresswell in a scene at the Ministry of Magic. Between November 2012 and January 2013, Wilson took on the role of the Artilleryman in the staged musical, Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds – The New Generation.

On 19 September 2013, Wilson confirmed he would replace Danny O'Donoghue as a coach on the third series of The Voice alongside will.i.am, Tom Jones, and fellow new coach Kylie Minogue, who replaced Jessie J.   In February, Katy B also appeared on the BBC as Wilson's team mentor. 

On 4 April 2015, Wilson was named as the winning coach of The Voice when Stevie McCrorie won the fourth series.

Wilson and Simon Rix wrote and performed the theme tune for Zig and Zag. 

Wilson joined new radio station Radio X in September 2015. He currently presents the Sunday morning show from 11am–2pm.

In October 2015, Wilson became the host of Sky 1's music and comedy panel show Bring the Noise. 

On the 9th April 2016, Wilson was named as the winning coach for the final BBC series of ""The Voice"" when Kevin Simm won the fifth series. The original idea was that Wilson was leaving his chair after the conclusion of the 5th series, though he also announced that he may return for the ITV series in 2017.

Passage:
Quokka
The quokka (, Setonix brachyurus), the only member of the genus Setonix, is a small macropod about the size of a domestic cat. Like other marsupials in the macropod family (such as kangaroos and wallabies), the quokka is herbivorous and mainly nocturnal. Quokkas can be found on some smaller islands off the coast of Western Australia, in particular on Rottnest Island just off Perth and Bald Island near Albany. A small mainland colony exists in the protected area of Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve, where they co-exist with Gilbert's potoroo.

Traits 

The quokka weighs  and is 40 to long with a 25 to long tail, which is fairly short for a macropod. It has a stocky build, rounded ears, and a short, broad head. Although looking rather like a very small kangaroo, it can climb small trees and shrubs. Its coarse fur is a grizzled brown colour, fading to buff underneath.

The quokka has little fear of humans and it is common for it to approach them closely, particularly on Rottnest Island. It is, however, illegal for members of the public to handle the animals in any way on Rottnest Island. An infringement notice carrying a A$300 fine can be issued by the Rottnest Island Authority for such behaviour.  In addition, prosecution of the offense can result in a fine of up to $2,000.   It has however become popular to take selfies, with the animal, where it seemingly smiles,  causing many to call it 'the happiest animal in the world'. 

Discovery by Europeans 

The quokka was one of the first Australian mammals seen by Europeans. The Dutch mariner Samuel Volckertzoon wrote of sighting ""a wild cat"" on Rottnest Island in 1658. In 1696, Willem de Vlamingh mistook them for giant rats and named the island ""Rotte nest"", which comes from the Dutch word rattennest meaning ""rat nest"".

The word quokka is derived from a Nyungar word, which was probably gwaga. 

Ecology 

In the wild, its roaming is restricted to a very small range in the South-West of Western Australia, with a number of small scattered populations.  There is one large population on Rottnest Island and a smaller population on Bald Island near Albany.  The islands are free of foxes and cats. On Rottnest, quokkas are common and occupy a variety of habitats ranging from semi-arid scrub to cultivated gardens. 

Diet 

Like most macropods, quokkas eat many types of vegetation, including grasses and leaves.  A study found that flowering plants of the genus Guichenotia are one of the quokka's favourite foods. 

Population 

Although numerous on the small offshore islands, the quokka has a very restricted range and is classified as vulnerable. On the mainland, where it is threatened by most introduced predatory species such as foxes, it requires dense ground cover for refuge. Clearfell logging and agricultural development have reduced this habitat, thus contributing to the decline of the species. The introduction of cats and dogs, as well as dingoes, has added to the problem, as has the clearing and burning of the remaining swamplands. Moreover, quokkas usually have a litter size of one and successfully rear one young each year. Although these animals are constantly mating, usually one day after their young is born, the small litter size paired with the restricted space and threatening predators contribute to the scarcity of these marsupials on the mainland. The population on Rottnest Island is 8,000–12,000.
Question:
The quokka is what type of animal?
Answer:
Penises of marsupials
Passage:
Carolyn Keene
Carolyn Keene is the pseudonym of the authors of the Nancy Drew mystery stories and The Dana Girls mystery stories, both produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate. In addition, the Keene pen name is credited with the Nancy Drew spin-off, River Heights and the Nancy Drew Notebooks.

Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of the Syndicate, hired writers, beginning with Mildred Wirt, later Mildred Wirt Benson, to write the manuscripts for the Nancy Drew books.  The writers initially were paid $125 for each book and were required by their contract to give up all rights to the work and to maintain confidentiality.

Benson is credited as the primary writer of Nancy Drew books under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene.  Harriet Adams (Stratemeyer's daughter) rewrote the original books and added new titles after the withdrawal of Benson. 

Other ghostwriters who used this name to write Nancy Drew mysteries included Leslie McFarlane, James Duncan Lawrence, Walter Karig, Nancy Axelrad, Patricia Doll, Charles S. Strong, Alma Sasse, Wilhelmina Rankin, George Waller Jr., Margaret Scherf, and Susan Wittig Albert. Also involved in the Nancy Drew writing process were Harriet Stratemeyer Adams's daughters, who gave input on the series and sometimes helped to choose book titles; the Syndicate's secretary, Harriet Otis Smith, who invented the characters of Nancy's friends Bess and George; and the editors at Grosset and Dunlap.

In 1979, the Stratemeyer Syndicate changed publishers to Simon & Schuster, a move that the former publishers, Grosset and Dunlap, went to court to prevent, claiming a breach of contract. The decision was made in favor of the Syndicate, stating that they could choose which publisher they would like to use, for subsequent entries in the series.

In 1985, the Syndicate was bought by publishers Simon & Schuster; the Drew books are now handled by Mega-Books, a New York book packager.

Passage:
Faun
The faun (, , phaunos,) is a mythological half human–half goat (from the head to the waist being human, but with the addition of goat horns) manifestation of forest and animal spirits that would help or hinder humans at whim.  They are often associated with the satyrs of Greek mythology. 

Origins

Romans believed fauns inspired fear in men traveling in lonely, remote or wild places. They were also capable of guiding humans in need, as in the fable of The Satyr and the Traveller, in the title of which Latin authors substituted the word Faunus. Fauns and satyrs were originally quite different creatures: whereas fauns are half-man and half-goat, satyrs originally were depicted as stocky, hairy, ugly dwarfs or woodwoses with the ears and tails of horses or asses. Satyrs also were more woman-loving than fauns, and fauns were rather foolish where satyrs had more knowledge.

Ancient Roman mythological belief also included a god named Faunus often associated with enchanted woods and the Greek god Pan  and a goddess named Fauna who were goat people.

The Barberini Faun (located in the Glyptothek in Munich, Germany) is a Hellenistic marble statue from about 200 BCE, found in the Mausoleum of the Emperor Hadrian (the Castel Sant'Angelo) and installed at Palazzo Barberini by Cardinal Maffeo Barberini (later Pope Urban VIII). Gian Lorenzo Bernini restored and refinished the statue. 

The House of the Faun in Pompei, dating from the 2nd century BCE, was so named because of the dancing faun statue that was the centerpiece of the large garden. The original now resides in the National Museum in Naples and a copy stands in its place. 

The French symbolist Stéphane Mallarmé's famous masterpiece L'après-midi d'un faune (published in 1876) describes the sensual experiences of a faun who has just woken up from his afternoon sleep and discusses his encounters with several nymphs during the morning in a dreamlike monologue.  The composer Claude Debussy based his symphonic poem Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune (1894)   on the poem, which also served as the scenario for a ballet entitled L'après-midi d'un faun (or Afternoon of a Faun) choreographed to Debussy's score in 1912 by Vaslav Nijinsky.

It has become a noticeable trend recent years for some fantasy artists to depict fauns as having the hind legs, tail, and antlers of a deer instead those of a goat. This may be due to the English word ""faun"" sounding the same as the English word for baby deer ""fawn"".

Fauns in fiction

* The Marble Faun (1860) is a romance set in Italy by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was said to have been inspired after viewing the Faun of Praxiteles in the Capitoline Museum. 
* Mr. Tumnus, in C. S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia (1949), is a faun. Lewis said that the famous Narnia story, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, all came to him from a single picture he had in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels through a snowy wood.
* In Lolita, the protagonist is attracted to pubescent girls whom he dubs ""nymphets""; ""faunlets"" are the male equivalent.
* In the 1981 film My Dinner With Andre it is related how fauns befriend and take a mathematician to meet Pan.
* In Guillermo del Toro's 2006 film Pan's Labyrinth (El Laberinto del Fauno), a faun guides the film's protagonist, Ofelia, to a series of tasks, which lead her to a wondrous netherworld.
* Don, in Rick Riordan's The Son of Neptune (2011), is a faun. In the book, several fauns appear, begging for money. Due to his memory of the Greek satyrs, Percy Jackson feels like there should be more to fauns. Also, in the prequel to The Son of Neptune, The Lost Hero, Jason Grace calls Gleeson Hedge a faun upon learning that he is a satyr. In the third instalment in the series, The Mark of Athena, Frank Zhang calls Hedge a faun.
* In The Goddess Within, a visionary fiction novel written by Iva Kenaz, the main heroine falls in love with a faun.

Tommy Johnson (1896 – November 1, 1956) was an influential American Delta blues musician who recorded in the late 1920s. He was known for his eerie falsetto voice and intricate guitar playing. His style influenced later blues singers, such as Robert Nighthawk and Howlin' Wolf. Johnson's ""Big Road Blues"" inspired Canned Heat's song ""On the Road Again"" Johnson died of a heart attack after playing a party in 1956. He is buried in the Warm Springs Methodist Church outside Crystal Springs, Mississippi. In 2001 his family commissioned a headstone through the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund, a nps.gov/history/delta/blues/people/tommy_johnson.htm site. The headstone is a replica of the one used in the movie ""The Blues"" by Hank Williams. Johnson was a talented composer, blending fragments of folk poetry and personalized lyrics into set guitar accompaniments to craft striking blues compositions such as ""Maggie Campbell"" and ""I Asked for Water [She Brought Me Gasoline]"" Johnson was an alcoholic and an itinerant musician, based in Crystal Springs but traveling widely around the South, sometimes accompanied by Papa Charlie McCoy. His recordings established him as the premier Delta blues vocalist of his day. He also performed tricks with his guitar, playing it between his legs and behind his head and throwing it in the air while playing. He did not record again, mistakenly believing that he had signed away his right to record. This resulted in a legal settlement with the Mississippi Sheiks, who had used the melody of Johnson's 'Canned Heat Blues' in their successful ""Stop and Listen"". Johnson was party to the copyright settlement but was too drunk at the time to understand what he hadsigned. He died at a local local Folk Folk Festival in 1956 and is buried at the Warm Spring Methodist Church in Mississippi, where he lived for most of his life. His music is still played today by a number of musicians, including Willie Brown, Charlie Patton and Ishman Bracey. His songs are included on the album Big Road Blues by K. C. Douglas, which was released in 1971. The song features the refrain ""canned heat, mama, sure, Lord, killing me."" The song was inspired by the cooking fuel Sterno. nprofit corporation; it was paid for by the musician Bonnie Raitt. The headstone had been on public display in the Crystal Springs Public Library since being unveiled on October 20, 2001. On the night of Saturday, February 2, 2013, the headstone was desecrated, apparently smashed by a sledge hammer or some similar device. An annual Tommy Johnson Blues Festival is held in Crystal Springs on the third weekend in October. In the film O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), a character named Tommy Johnson, played by Chris Thomas King, describes selling his soul to the devil to play guitar. The Tommy Johnson character in the film plays a number of songs originally recorded by the blues musician Skip James and accompanies the Soggy Bottom Boys, a band consisting of the film's three main protagonists plus Johnson, on ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" The story was first told by his brother, LaDell Johnson, and reported by David Evans in his 1971 biography of Johnson. This legend was subsequently attributed to the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Skip James, and later to Tommy Johnson himself. The first Tommy Johnson blues festival was held in Jackson and Crystal Springs in 2006, and the second in 2008, and it was held at the same venue in 2010 and 2011. The festival is now held every year in October, but it was canceled in 2012 due to a dispute over a deteriorated road to the burial site in Copiah County, Tennessee. The dispute was resolved in October 2012, when it was announced that a new headstone would be erected on October 26. The memorial was not placed on his grave for several years afterward, however, because of a dispute between Johnson's family (led by his niece, Vera Johnson Collins) and the owners of farm property encircling the cemetery. It was finally placed on Johnson's grave on October 25, 2013. The ceremony was attended by more than 1,000 people, including the mayor of Crystal Springs, the mayor, and members of the state legislature and the county board of supervisors. The funeral was held on October 28, 2013 at the cemetery in Jackson, Tennessee, with a service to be held on the following day at 11am. The service was attended in memory of Johnson, who died in 1968. The music was performed by his family and friends, including his nephew, the Rev. Robert Johnson, Jr., and his nephew's wife, the late singer-songwriter-guitarist-violinist-singer-viola-violate-violace. A fathom is a unit of length in the imperial and the U.S. customary systems equal to 6 feet (1.8288 metres), used especially for measuring the depth of water. Originally based on the distance between a man's outstretched arms, the size of a fathom has varied slightly depending on whether it was defined as a thousandth of an (Admiralty) nautical mile or as a multiple of the imperial yard. The name derives from the Old English word fæðm, corresponding to the Old High German word ""fadum"" meaning embracing arms or a pair of outstretched Arms. With the adoption of the metric SI system the use of fathoms declined. The term was used for any of several units of length varying around 5 -. At one time, a quarter meant one-fourth of the fathom. The fathom line or fathom curve, a usually sinuous line on a nautical chart, joins all points having the same depth ofWater, thereby indicating the contour of the ocean. The components of a commercial fisherman's set were measured in bundles of 300-fathoms. A single line of a set of 50-fathomline was used to take the middle in the middle of the Pacific to take a tuck of 70 tuck or tuck seine. Especially in the Pacific, the setline was composed of units called ""skates"", each consisting of several hundred units of groundline, with gangions and hooks attached. A tuck tuck was about 70 ft long (420 ft) in the very deep Pacific and very deep in very deep waters. A fathogram is a record made by such a device is a fathograms (trademark) The term fathom was used in the 60's to refer to the title of a Tommy Johnson blues hit of 1928 that told the story of an alcoholic who had desperately turned to drinking cooking fuel? The song was called 'CANNED HEAT' by the group The 60's 60's Tribute Band, and the song was recorded by the band's lead singer, Bob Marley, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It was released as a single single track album called '60's 60s 60s Tribute. The album was released by Atlantic Records, a division of Atlantic Records and Atlantic Records Ltd, and was released in the UK in the 1970s and 1980s. The UK version of the song has been re-released as a double CD, 'Canned HEAT', with a single track of the same name. A line attached to a whaling harpoon was about 150 fathoms long (900 ft) A burial at sea (where the body is weighted to force it to the bottom) requires a minimum of six fathom of water. In Britain, it can mean the quantity of wood in a pile of any length measuring 6 ft square in cross section. In Finland, fathom (syli) is sometimes, albeit seldom, used as a maritime unit, of a nautical mile and of cable length. In the UK, it was the unit used to measure the depth of mines (mineral extraction) in the 20th century. In Hungary square fathom (""négyszögöl"") is still in use as an unofficial measure of land area, primarily for small lots suitable for construction. The U.S. Court of Appeal dismissed the 89-year-old’s claims that moving him to Germany would amount to torture because of his poor health. Demjanjuk will be tried for assisting in the killing of Jews at the Sobibor extermination camp in Poland during World War Two. He served two years in the camps of Sobibor and Majdanek in Nazi-occupied Poland and then in Flossenburg in Bavaria, Germany. He was a Soviet Red Army soldier when he was captured by the Nazis in 1942 and spent years in prison in Cleveland, Ohio, before being deported to Israel in 1988. He returned to his home in 1993 and his citizenship was restored in 1998 when new evidence came to light after the collapse of the Soviet Union. And in 2002, German prosecutors began to put him on trial for all the accusations, despite a second time being stripped of his citizenship of working at three other camps. He maintains that he was forcible removed from his home and that he is in good health and able to walk without help. He has been sentenced to death in 1988, accused of being a sadistic Nazi guard nicknamed ""Ivan the Terrible"" But Israel's highest court later ruled that the man was not the man in question in an Israeli prison, and he returned to Cleveland in 1993. The case was reopened in 1998 after new evidence was reopened and he was convicted in 2002 of working in three other prisons in Israel and the United States. He is now facing extradition to Germany to stand trial for the alleged murder of six people at the camp, including two women. Nick Stone is the main fictional character in a series of books written by Andy McNab. The characters' name and early years were allegedly based on those of a teenage acquaintance of McNab last known working a postman in Dartford. Nick has undertaken many missions including kidnapping a powerful Russian Mafia lord and killing a money-laundering Algerian business man. He left the SAS in 1988, soon after the shooting of three IRA volunteers in Gibraltar. In Dark Winter, Stone unearths a doomsday threat against the populations of New York, London and Berlin and finds himself facing an unspeakable trade-off; the life of someone he loves, against those of millions he doesn't even know. He has had many chapters in his life and led a path that has taken him all over the world (including The Congo, Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Southern France, Ireland, Ul Ul.d to work in the camps. He says holocaust survivors have mistaken him for other, cruel camp guards. In Remote Control he is asked if he is still married to which he replies 'no I divorced her', she is also mentioned in subsequent novels as a gauge on women's effect on him. It seems he was being used for unofficial jobs by British Intelligence as early as 1995, as the character Sarah in Crisis Four encouraged him to approach them. In Aggressor he says in Aggressor that his last job with the Regiment was supervising and being actively involved in the infamous Waco siege in 1993, he also refers to carrying out operations in the Gulf War in some of his books, mirroringAndy McNab's own SAS career. In Crisis Four he is listed on his file at MI6 for the reason he divorced his wife. He also briefly worked for an American agency. He was deported from the US aged 89 to face a war crime trial in Germany. He is the subject of a new book, The Man Who Knew Too Much, by John Demjanuk, which is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. The book is due to be published in paperback on September 14.

Quokkas can be found on some smaller islands off the coast of Western Australia, in particular on Rottnest Island just off Perth and Bald Island near Albany. It is illegal for members of the public to handle the animals in any way. An infringement notice carrying a A$300 fine can be issued by the RottNest Island Authority for such behaviour. In addition, prosecution of the offense can result in a fine of up to $2,000. It has become popular to take selfies, with the animal, where it seemingly smiles,  causing many to call it 'the happiest animal in the world' It is classified as vulnerable where it is threatened by foxes, it requires denes, and is classified by the Australian government as a 'vulnerable' species. The word 'quokka' is derived from a Nyungar word, which was probably gwaga, meaning 'rat nest' In 1696, Willem de Vlamingh mistook them for giant rats and named the island ""Rotte nest"", which comes from the Dutch word rattennest meaning ""rat nest"". A small mainland colony exists in the protected area of Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve, where they co-exist with Gilbert's potoroo. In the wild, its roaming is restricted to a very small range in the South-West of Western Australian, with a number of small scattered populations. A study found that quokkas eat many types of vegetation, including grasses and leaves, including the flowering plants of Guichenotia, one of the species' favourite foods. It weighs  and is 40 to long with a 25 to long tail, which is fairly short for a Macropod. Quokkas usually have a litter size of one and successfully rear one young each year. Clearfell logging and agricultural development have reduced this habitat, thus contributing to the decline of the species. Harriet Adams (Stratemeyer's daughter) rewrote the original books and added new titles after the withdrawal of Mildred Wirt Benson. Other ghostwriters who used this name to write Nancy Drew mysteries included Leslie McFarlane, James Duncan Lawrence, Walter Karig, Nancy Axelrad, Patricia Doll, Charles S. Strong, Alma Sasse, Wilhelmina Rankin, George Waller Jr., Margaret Scherf, and Susan Wittig Albert. Carolyn Keene is the pseudonym of the authors of the Nancy Drew mystery stories and The Dana Girls mystery stories, both produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate. In 1985, the Syndicate was bought by publishers Simon & Schuster; the Drew books are now handled by Mega-Books, a New York book packager. The population on Rottnest Island is 8,000–12,000. The faun (,, phaunos,) is a mythological half human–half goat (from the head to the waist being human, but with the addition of goat horns) manifestation of forest and animal spirits that would help or hinder humans at whim. They are often associated with the satyrs of Greek mythology.Romans believed fauns inspired fear in men traveling in lonely, remote or wild places. They were also capable of guiding humans in need, as in the fable of The Satyr and the Traveller, in the title of which Latin authors substituted the word Faunus. Fauns are half-man and half-goat, whereas satyrs originally were depicted as stocky, hairy, ugly dwarfs or woodwoses with the ears and tails of horses or asses. Satyrs also were more woman-loving than faunas, and faun’s were rather foolish where satyrs had more knowledge. In the Roman mythological belief, the god Panaunus was associated with enchanted woods and a Greek god named Fauna who were also called goat people. The word faun is used to refer to a god of the underworld, the underworld or the underworld who is said to be half human and half goat. The House of the Faun in Pompei, dating from the 2nd century BCE, was so named because of the dancing faun statue that was the centerpiece of the large garden. The composer Claude Debussy based his symphonic poem Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune (1894) on the poem. In Lolita, the protagonist is attracted to pubescent girls whom he dubs ""nymphets""; ""faunlets"" are the male equivalent. In Guillermo del Toro's 2006 film Pan's Labyrinth (El Laberinto del Fauno), a faun guides the film's protagonist, Ofelia, to a wondrous netherworld. In Rick Riordan's The Son of Neptune (2011), several fauns appear, begging for money. Due to his memory of the Greek satyrs, Percy Jackson feels like there should be more tofauns. In The Lost Hero, Jason Grace calls Gleeson Hedge a fauna upon learning that he is a satyr. In the third instalment in the series, The Mark of Athena, Frank Zhang calls Hedge afaun. In C.S. Lewis' 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', what is the name of the faun who befriends 'Lucy' when she first enters 'Narnia'? Mr. Tumnus, in The Chronicles of Narnia (1949), is a f Shaun. The Marble Faun (1860) is a romance set in Italy by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was said to have been inspired after viewing the Fauna of Praxiteles in the Capitoline Museum. This may be due to the English word ""Faun"" sounding the same as the Englishword for baby deer ""fawn"". Some fantasy artists to depict faun's as having the hind legs, tail, and antlers of a deer instead those of a goat. The faun is a character in the 1981 film My Dinner With Andre. It is related how faunS befriend and take a mathematician to meet Pan in the film My dinner with Andre. The film is based on a novel written by Iva Kenaz."

List of FA Cup finals
The Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the FA Cup, is a knockout competition in English football, organised by and named after The Football Association (the FA). It is the oldest existing football competition in the world,  having commenced in the 1871–72 season. The tournament is open to all clubs in the top 10 levels of the English football league system, although a club's home stadium must meet certain requirements prior to entering the tournament.  The competition culminates at the end of the league season usually in May with the FA Cup Final, officially named The Football Association Challenge Cup Final Tie, which has traditionally been regarded as the showpiece finale of the English football season. 

All of the final venues, apart from four, have been in London with most being played at the original Wembley Stadium, which was used from 1923 until the stadium closed in 2000. The new stadium of the same name has been the permanent venue of the final since 2007. Other venues used for the final prior to 1923 were Kennington Oval, Crystal Palace, Stamford Bridge and Lillie Bridge, all in London, Goodison Park in Liverpool and Fallowfield Stadium and Old Trafford in Manchester. The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff hosted the final for six years (2001–2006), while the new Wembley Stadium was under construction. Other grounds have been used for replays, which until 1999 took place if the initial match ended in a draw.

As of 2016, the record for the most wins is held by Arsenal and Manchester United with 12 victories. The cup has been won by the same team in two or more consecutive years on ten occasions, and four teams have won consecutive finals more than once: Wanderers, Blackburn Rovers, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal. The cup has been won by a non-English team once. The cup is currently held by Manchester United, who defeated Crystal Palace in the 2016 final.

History

The winners of the first tournament were Wanderers, a team of former public schoolboys based in London, who went on to win the competition five times in its first seven seasons. The early winners of the competition were all teams of wealthy amateurs from the south of England,  but in 1883, Blackburn Olympic became the first team from the north to win the cup, defeating Old Etonians. Upon his team's return to Blackburn, Olympic captain Albert Warburton proclaimed: ""The Cup is very welcome to Lancashire. It'll have a good home and it'll never go back to London."" 

With the advent of professionalism at around the same time, the amateur teams quickly faded from prominence in the competition. The leading professional clubs formed The Football League in 1888.  Since then, one non-league team has won the cup. Tottenham Hotspur, then of the Southern League, defeated Sheffield United of The Football League to win the 1901 final.  A year later Sheffield United returned to the final and won the cup, which then remained in the hands of Northern and Midland clubs until Tottenham won it again in 1921. In 1927, Cardiff City, a team which plays in the English football league system despite being based in Wales, won the cup, the only non-English club to do so.  Scottish club Queens Park reached the final twice in the early years of the competition.

Newcastle United enjoyed a brief spell of FA Cup dominance in the 1950s, winning the trophy three times in five years, and in the 1960s, Tottenham Hotspur enjoyed a similar spell of success, with three wins in seven seasons. This marked the start of a successful period for London-based clubs, with 11 wins in 22 seasons.  Teams from the second tier of English football, at the time called the Second Division, experienced an unprecedented run of cup success between 1973 and 1980. Sunderland won the cup in 1973, Southampton repeated the feat in 1976, and West Ham United won in 1980, the most recent victory by a team from outside the top division. Since Wimbledon's win in 1988,  the so-called ""Big Four"" clubs of English football,  Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, have between them won the cup 22 times in 27 seasons.

Finals

Until 1999, a draw in the final would result in the match being replayed at a later date;  since then the final has always been decided on the day, with a penalty shootout as required.  As of 2015 a penalty shoot-out has been required on only two occasions, in the 2005 and 2006 finals. The competition did not take place during the First and Second World Wars, other than in the 1914–15 season, when it was completed, and the 1939–40 season, when it was abandoned during the qualifying rounds.

Key

All teams are English, except where marked  (Scottish) or  (Welsh).

Results

A.  The official attendance for the 1923 final was reported as 126,047, but the actual figure is believed to be anywhere between 150,000 and 300,000.  

Results by team

Teams shown in italics are no longer in existence. Additionally, Queen's Park ceased to be eligible to enter the FA Cup after a Scottish Football Association ruling in 1887. 

A.  Sheffield Wednesday's total includes two wins and one defeat under the earlier name of The Wednesday.
B.  Wimbledon relocated in 2004 from south London to Milton Keynes rebranding the club as Milton Keynes Dons, but the current incarnation of the club contends that it was founded in 2004 and does not lay claim to the history or honours (including the FA Cup win) of Wimbledon.

Azharuddin and 4 Others Are Punished for Cricket Match Fixing : Former India Captain Banned
By PRADEEP MAGAZINE and INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE

Continue reading the main story
NEW DELHI— Mohammed Azharuddin, the former India captain and one of world cricket's finest batsmen, was banned from the sport for life Tuesday for his involvement in match fixing.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India, or BCCI, whose role in the matter had come under criticism from India's federal investigation agency, known as the CBI, also announced bans for three other players and a former India team physiotherapist.
Ajay Sharma, who played for the country in one test match against the West Indies in 1989, also was banned for life. Ajay Jadeja, a middle-order batsman, Dr. Ali Irani, a physiotherapist, and, ironically, Manoj Prabhakar, who started the scandal when he accused others of match fixing, all received five-year bans for their involvement with bookmakers.
""This is a sad day in the annals of Indian cricket,"" A.C. Muthiah, chief of the BCCI, said after a meeting of the board's disciplinary committee in Madras.
Continue reading the main story
""There is clear evidence of match fixing against Azharuddin,"" Muthiah said. ""There also is evidence that Sharma acted as a conduit for match fixing. That's why we clubbed the two of them together and gave life bans. Others had nexus with bookmakers and introduced players to the bookmakers, which is a serious breach of cricketing codes.""

The BCCI has been under pressure since the release of a CBI report on match fixing in November. The report accused these players of having links with bookies and of ""under-performing"" in return for huge sums of money. In a country where cricket means what soccer does in Europe, there has been a public outcry demanding punishment for the guilty.
The CBI devoted a full chapter of its report to the BCCI. The report said that while there was no evidence that any officials were involved in match fixing, such a widespread racket was not possible without their knowledge.
Before the CBI report become public, Azharuddin said he was being targeted because, as a Muslim, he belonged to the minority community. He did not comment Tuesday.
Sharma, the other player banned for life, told a news agency that ""the decision of the board is arbitrary"" and that he was ""going to seek legal remedy.""
Jadeja denied any wrongdoing and said he would appeal against the punishment. ""I have to restore my credibility,"" he said. ""I will appeal to the board and even go to the court to get justice.""
The CBI report had linked Sharma with Azharuddin, saying the former was responsible for introducing the bookmaker Mukesh Gupta to Azharuddin. Hansie Cronje, the South African captain banned in October, has said Azharuddin introduced him to Gupta in 1997 in India.
Given the nature of politics in India — the governing Bharatiya Janata Party is a rightist Hindu party — the indictment of Azharuddin might have the potential of becoming a socially explosive issue. The situation may be defused by the fact that there are others being punished who do not belong to the minority community.
The most bizarre and mysterious role in the matter is that of Prabhakar. The scandal began in India in 1997 when Prabhakar wrote, in a signed article in a Delhi-based magazine, that he was offered 2.5 million rupees ($53,000) by a teammate to underperform in a match against Pakistan in 1994.

When Prabhakar later said that the player was Kapil Dev, the great Indian all-rounder and team captain, he sent the nation into a tailspin. In May, shortly after Cronje was charged in India and accused of fixing two matches against India in 1999, the government ordered the CBI probe.
The CBI exonerated Kapil but alleged that Prabhakar had played a leading role in introducing international cricketers to Gupta, including Brian Lara, the former West Indies captain; Alec Stewart, the former England captain; Dean Jones, the Australian batsman; and Arjuna Ranatunga and Arvinda de Silva, the former Sri Lankan captains.
""I launched the crusade to cleanse the game and I have succeeded in doing it,"" Prabhakar said. ""But I feel sad that the BCCI did not even have the courtesy to note the contribution I made to clear the dirt. It instead equated me with other players.
""There is a lot of difference between me and them. I was fighting against the system of which they were a part.""
Prabhakar's accusation in 1997 had appeared against a backdrop of widespread allegations of match fixing by Pakistani players and accusations by two Australian players — Mark Waugh and Shane Warne — that a former Pakistani captain, Salim Malik, had offered them bribe to throw a test match.
The Indian public was willing to believe that match fixing happened outside its own borders, but those who pointed fingers at Indian players were called ""traitors"" and even ""anti-national.""
Pakistan was the first country to react to the allegations. After a judicial probe, Malik was banned for life and Wasim Akram, Pakistan's best-known player, was fined.
The inquiry even alleged that Waugh and Shane had taken money from Indian bookmakers. The pair were fined after admitting they had given an Indian bookmaker information on weather and the state of the wicket.
When Cronje admitted his links with the same bookmaker it became hard for Indian fans to believe their own players were not tainted.

Passage:
Lentigo
A lentigo (plural lentigines,) is a small pigmented spot on the skin with a clearly defined edge, surrounded by normal-appearing skin. It is a harmless (benign) hyperplasia of melanocytes which is linear in its spread. This means the hyperplasia of melanocytes is restricted to the cell layer directly above the basement membrane of the epidermis where melanocytes normally reside. This is in contrast to the ""nests"" of multi-layer melanocytes found in moles (melanocytic nevi). Because of this characteristic feature, the adjective ""lentiginous"" is used to describe other skin lesions that similarly proliferate linearly within the basal cell layer.  

Lentigines are distinguished from freckles (ephelis) based on the proliferation of melanocytes. Freckles have a relatively normal number of melanocytes but an increased amount of melanin. A lentigo has an increased number of melanocytes. Freckles will increase in number and darkness with sunlight exposure, whereas lentigines will stay stable in their color regardless of sunlight exposure.

Conditions characterized by lentigines include: 

* Lentigo simplex
* Solar lentigo (Liver spots)
* PUVA lentigines
* Ink spot lentigo
* LEOPARD syndrome
* Mucosal lentigines
* Multiple lentigines syndrome
* Moynahan syndrome
* Generalized lentiginosis
* Centrofacial lentiginosis
* Carney complex
* Inherited patterned lentiginosis in black persons
* Partial unilateral lentiginosis
* Peutz-Jeghers syndrome
* Acral lentiginous melanoma

Birthstone
A birthstone is a gemstone that represents a person's month of birth. Birth stones are and can be worn as jewellery and pendants.

History of birthstones

Western custom

The first century Jewish historian Josephus believed there was a connection between the twelve stones in Aaron's breastplate, the twelve months of the year, and the twelve signs of the zodiac.  Translations and interpretations of the passage in Exodus regarding the breastplate have varied widely, however, with Josephus himself giving two different lists for the twelve stones  (Kunz argues that Josephus saw the breastplate of the Second Temple, not the one described in Exodus).  St. Jerome, referencing Josephus, said the Foundation Stones of the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:19–20) would be appropriate for Christians to use.  In the eighth and ninth century, religious treaties associating a particular stone with an apostle were written because the book of Revelation stated ""their name would be inscribed on the Foundation Stones, and his virtue"".  Practice became to keep twelve stones and wear one a month.  Wearing a single birthstone is only a few centuries old, although modern authorities differ on dates Kunz places the custom in eighteenth century Poland, while the Gemological Institute of America starts it in Germany in the 1560s. 

Modern lists of birthstones have little to do with either the breastplate or the Foundation Stones of Christianity. Tastes, customs and confusing translations have distanced them from their historical origins,  with one author calling the 1912 Kansas list ""nothing but a piece of unfounded salesmanship."" 

Traditional birthstones

Ancient traditional birthstones are society-based birthstones. The table below contains many stones which are popular choices, often reflecting Polish tradition. 

The Gregorian calendar has poems matching each month with its birthstone. These are traditional stones of English-speaking societies. Tiffany & Co. published these poems ""of unknown author"" for the first time in a pamphlet in 1870. 

Modern birthstones

In 1912, in an effort to standardize birthstones, the (American) National Association of Jewelers (now called Jewelers of America) met in Kansas and officially adopted a list.  The Jewelry Industry Council of America updated the list in 1952  by adding alexandrite to June and citrine to November; specifying pink tourmaline for October; replacing December's lapis with zircon; and switching the primary/alternative gems in March. The American Gem Trade Association added tanzanite as a December birthstone in 2002.  In 2016, the American Gem Trade Association and Jewelers of America added spinel as an additional birthstone for August.   Britain's National Association of Goldsmiths created their own standardized list of birthstones in 1937. 

Eastern custom

A Hindu text from 1879, Mani Mala, lists gems for each month.

The Danish royals set the trend for future kings' names
It's a pretty exclusive club, being a future European monarch, but do the names of the current heirs in waiting give us any clues as to what the Cambridges might pick for their baby?  With five girls and one boy lined up to take their country's thrones in a couple of generations time there are already plenty of ideas around for names judged appropriate for 21st century monarchs.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after the Trooping of the Colour on June 10th 2013.  It was Kate's last official public appearance before the birth of her baby, due this Saturday, July 13th 2013.
(photo Carfax2)
Let's start with the most exclusive club of all - the men who will be king.  This future monarch is flying solo - thanks mostly to changes in laws right across the old continent that mean that firstborn girls can become queen regardless of little brothers.  Christian of Denmark is, at the moment, the only male heir among the primary school prince and princess club of Europe.  And his name was by far the easiest to predict.  The kings of Denmark have been called either Frederick or Christian since 1513. 
King John of Denmark, who ruled from 1481 to 1513.  He was the last male monarch of his country not to be called Frederick or Christian.
The royal house alternates between the name according to the generations so when the current Crown Prince, Frederick, and his wife, Mary, had their first child in October 2005 there were no surprises when he ended up called Christian.  The royal couple added to the suspense a little by following the Danish royal tradition of not announcing the name until the baby's christening but when they stepped up to the font in the Chapel of the Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen in January 2006 they stuck with tradition.
Prince Christian of Denmark waves from the balcony of the royal palace in Copenhagen.  He is the only future king among the young generation of Europe's royals.
So if future Queen Consort, Kate Middleton, has a boy then the European royal trend points to an ultra traditional name that's already been used by several kings and that could mean the bookies are spot on with their prediction of George for a little prince of Cambridge.

Richard Poole (character)
Detective Inspector Richard Poole is a character in the crime drama television series Death in Paradise, portrayed by Ben Miller.

A British inspector assigned to Saint Marie to investigate the previous inspector's murder, Poole was instructed to remain on the island as the new police detective. Despite his distaste for the island and inexperience with tropical weather - to the point where he continued to wear his old suits - he often showed a useful knack for making deductive leaps based on minimal information and random events, and favoured making arrests by addressing all the suspects at once before identifying the killer. In series 2 he grew slightly more relaxed. He recommended Fidel for the sergeant's exam. Poole briefly returned to London, but in spite of his distaste for Saint Marie, he chose to return. Richard was murdered in the first episode of Series 3, at a Cambridge university reunion, by Helen Reid, when he threatened to expose her identity theft, and was replaced by DI Humphrey Goodman.

Poole is an ""English eccentric with a hatred for island life"".  According to Michael Hogan, Poole ""harrumphs around Hugh Grant-ishly in his uptight Brit suit and carries a briefcase, endlessly dabbing at his forehead with a hankie."" Hogan goes on to argue that Poole is a ""bland blend of several dozen ""quirky"" screen sleuths: a bit of Morse here, a dash of Columbo there, a pinch of Precious Ramotswe and a lug of Jonathan Creek to taste.""

Passage:
Great Architect of the Universe
The Great Architect of the Universe (also Grand Architect of the Universe or Supreme Architect of the Universe) is a conception of God discussed by many Christian theologians and apologists.  As a designation it is used within Freemasonry to represent deity neutrally (in whatever form, and by whatever name each member may individually believe in).  It is also a Rosicrucian conception of God, as expressed by Max Heindel.  The concept of the demiurge as a grand architect or a great architect also occurs in gnosticism and other religious and philosophical systems.

Christianity

The concept of God as the (Great) Architect of the Universe has been employed many times in Christianity. An illustration of God as the architect of the universe can be found in a Bible from the Middle Ages  and the comparison of God to an architect has been used by Christian apologists and teachers.

Saint Thomas Aquinas said in the Summa: ""God, Who is the first principle of all things, may be compared to things created as the architect is to things designed (ut artifex ad artificiata).""   Commentators have pointed out that the assertion that the Grand Architect of the Universe is the Christian God ""is not evident on the basis of 'natural theology' alone but requires an additional 'leap of faith' based on the revelation of the Bible"". 

John Calvin, in his Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536), repeatedly calls the Christian God ""the Architect of the Universe"", also referring to his works as ""Architecture of the Universe"", and in his commentary on Psalm 19 refers to the Christian God as the ""Great Architect"" or ""Architect of the Universe"".

Freemasonry

Masonic historians such as William Bissey,  Gary Leazer (quoting Coil's Masonic Encyclopaedia),  and S. Brent Morris,  assert that ""the Masonic abbreviation G.A.O.T.U., meaning the Great Architect of the Universe, continues a long tradition of using an allegorical name for the Deity.""  They trace how the name and the abbreviation entered Masonic tradition from the Book of Constitutions written in 1723 by the Reverend James Anderson.  They also note that Anderson, a Calvinist minister, probably took the term from Calvin's usage.

Christopher Haffner's own explanation of how the Masonic concept of a Great Architect of the Universe, as a placeholder for the Supreme Being of one's choice, is given in Workman Unashamed:

The Swedish Rite, which has the prerequisite of professing to Christian Faith, uses the form ""The Threefold Great Architect of the Universe"".

Hermeticism

The Great Architect may also be a metaphor alluding to the godhead potentiality of every individual. ""(God)... That invisible power which all know does exist, but understood by many different names, such as God, Spirit, Supreme Being, Intelligence, Mind, Energy, Nature and so forth.""   In the Hermetic Tradition, each and every person has the potential to become God, this idea or concept of God is perceived as internal rather than external. The Great Architect is also an allusion to the observer created universe. We create our own reality; hence we are the architect. Another way would be to say that the mind is the builder.

Rosicrucianism

In Heindel's exposition, the Great Architect of the Universe is the Supreme Being, who proceeds from The Absolute, at the dawn of manifestation.  For a detailed discussion, see The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception.

Gnosticism

The concept of the Great Architect of the Universe occurs in gnosticism. The Demiurge is The Great Architect of the Universe, the God of Old Testament, in opposition to Christ and Sophia, messengers of Gnosis of the True God.
For example: Gnostics such as the Nasoræans believe the Pira Rabba is the source, origin, and container of all things, which is filled by the Mânâ Rabbâ, the Great Spirit, from which emanates the First Life.  The First Life prays for companionship and progeny, whereupon the Second Life, the Ultra Mkayyema or World-constituting Æon, the Architect of the Universe, comes into being.  From this architect come a number of æons, who erect the universe under the foremanship of the Mandâ d'Hayye or gnôsis zoês, the Personified Knowledge of Life. 

Others

James Hopwood Jeans, in his book The Mysterious Universe, also employs the concept of a Great Architect of the Universe, saying at one point ""Lapsing back again into the crudely anthropomorphic language we have already used, we may say that we have already considered with disfavour the possibility of the universe having been planned by a biologist or an engineer; from the intrinsic evidence of his creation, the Great Architect of the Universe now begins to appear as a pure mathematician.""    To that Jinarajadasa adds his observation that the Great Architect is ""also a Grand Geometrician. For in some manner or other, whether obvious or hidden, there seems to be a geometric basis to every object in the universe."" 

The concept of the Demiurge as a benevolent great architect or grand architect of matter occurs in the writings of Plato, including in the Timaeus.

The concept of a Great Architect of the Universe also occurs in Martinism.  Martinist doctrine is that the Great Architect must not be worshipped.  Martinists hold that whilst it is possible to ""invoque"" Him, it is not to adore Him.

Which organisation refers to God as ‘The Great Architect of the Universe’?

Passage:
Calcium carbide
Calcium carbide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula of CaC2. Its main use industrially is in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide.

The pure material is colorless, however pieces of technical-grade calcium carbide are grey or brown and consist of about 80–85% of CaC2 (the rest is CaO (calcium oxide), Ca3P2 (calcium phosphide), CaS (calcium sulfide), Ca3N2 (calcium nitride), SiC (silicon carbide), etc.). In the presence of trace moisture, technical-grade calcium carbide emits an unpleasant odor reminiscent of garlic. 

Applications of calcium carbide include manufacture of acetylene gas, and for generation of acetylene in carbide lamps; manufacture of chemicals for fertilizer; and in steelmaking.

Production

Calcium carbide is produced industrially in an electric arc furnace from a mixture of lime and coke at approximately 2200 °C. This method has not changed since its invention in 1892:
CaO + 3 C → CaC2 + CO

The high temperature required for this reaction is not practically achievable by traditional combustion, so the reaction is performed in an electric arc furnace with graphite electrodes. The carbide product produced generally contains around 80% calcium carbide by weight. The carbide is crushed to produce small lumps that can range from a few mm up to 50 mm. The impurities are concentrated in the finer fractions. The CaC2 content of the product is assayed by measuring the amount of acetylene produced on hydrolysis. As an example, the British and German standards for the content of the coarser fractions are 295 L/kg and 300 L/kg respectively (at 101 kPa pressure and 20 °C temperature). Impurities present in the carbide include phosphide, which produces phosphine when hydrolysed.[http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/emrw/9783527306732/ueic/article/a04_533/current/pdf Calcium Carbide], Bernhard Langhammer, Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley Interscience. (Subscription required)

This reaction was an important part of the industrial revolution in chemistry, and was made possible in the USA as a result of massive amounts of inexpensive hydroelectric power produced at Niagara Falls before the turn of the 20th century. 

The method for the production in an electric arc furnace was discovered in 1892 by T. L Willson and independently by H. Moissan in the same year.   

Crystal structure

Pure calcium carbide is a colourless solid. The common crystalline form at room temperature is a distorted rock-salt structure with the C22− units lying parallel.

Applications

Production of acetylene

The reaction of calcium carbide with water, producing acetylene and calcium hydroxide, was discovered by Friedrich Wöhler in 1862.
CaC2 + 2 H2O → C2H2 + Ca(OH)2

This reaction was the basis of the industrial manufacture of acetylene, and is the major industrial use of calcium carbide.

At high temperatures, CaC2 reacts with water vapor to give calcium carbonate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

Today acetylene is mainly manufactured by the partial combustion of methane or appears as a side product in the ethylene stream from cracking of hydrocarbons. Approximately 400,000 tonnes are produced this way annually (see Acetylene Preparation).

In China, acetylene derived from calcium carbide remains a raw material for the chemical industry, in particular for the production of polyvinyl chloride. Locally produced acetylene is more economical than using imported oil.  Production of calcium carbide in China has been increasing. In 2005 output was 8.94 million tons, with the capacity to produce 17 million tons. 

In the USA, Europe, and Japan, consumption of calcium carbide is generally declining.  Production levels in the USA in 1990s were 236,000 tons per year.

Production of calcium cyanamide

Calcium carbide reacts with nitrogen at high temperature to form calcium cyanamide:
CaC2 + N2 → CaCN2 + C
Commonly known as nitrolim, calcium cyanamide is used as fertilizer. It is hydrolysed to cyanamide, H2NCN.

Steelmaking

Calcium carbide is used:
* in the desulfurisation of iron (pig iron, cast iron and steel)
* as a fuel in steelmaking to extend the scrap ratio to liquid iron, depending on economics.
* as a powerful deoxidizer at ladle treatment facilities.

Carbide lamps

Calcium carbide is used in carbide lamps. Water dripping on carbide produces acetylene gas, which burns and produces light. While these lamps gave steadier and brighter light than candles, they were dangerous in coal mines, where flammable methane gas made them a serious hazard. The presence of flammable gases in coal mines led to miner safety lamps such as the Davy lamp, in which a wire gauze reduces the risk of methane ignition. Carbide lamps were still used extensively in slate, copper, and tin mines where methane is not a serious hazard. Most miner's lamps have now been replaced by electric lamps.

Carbide lamps are still used for mining in some less wealthy countries, for example in the silver mines near Potosí, Bolivia. Carbide lamps are also still used by some cavers exploring caves and other underground areas,  although they are increasingly being replaced in this use by LED lights.

Carbide lamps were also used extensively as headlights in early automobiles, motorcycles and bicycles, but have been replaced entirely by electric lamps. 

Other uses

In the artificial ripening of fruit, calcium carbide is sometimes used as source of acetylene gas, which is a ripening agent similar to ethylene.IUPAC name ethene, chemical formula of C2H4  However, this is illegal in some countries because consumption of fruits artificially ripened using calcium carbide can cause serious health problems in those who partake them.  

Calcium carbide is used in toy cannons such as the Big-Bang Cannon, as well as in bamboo cannons.

Calcium carbide, together with calcium phosphide, is used in floating, self-igniting naval signal flares, such as those produced by the Holmes' Marine Life Protection Association.
Question:
What gas is produced when water is added to calcium carbide?
Answer:
H2C2
Passage:
Meissen
Meissen (in German orthography: Meißen) is a town of approximately 30,000 about 25 km northwest of Dresden on both banks of the Elbe river in the Free State of Saxony, in eastern Germany. Meissen is the home of Meissen porcelain, the Albrechtsburg castle, the Gothic Meissen Cathedral and the Meissen Frauenkirche. The Große Kreisstadt is the capital of the Meissen district.

History

Meissen is sometimes known as the ""cradle of Saxony"". The city grew out of the early Slavic settlement of Mis(s)ni, named for the small river Mis(s)na today Meis(s)abach (see Miesbach/Musbach/Mosbach), inhabited by the Slavic Glomacze tribe and was founded as a German town by King Henry the Fowler of Germany in 929. In 968, the Diocese of Meissen was founded, and Meissen became the episcopal see of a bishop. The Catholic bishopric was suppressed in 1581 after the diocese accepted the Protestant Reformation (1559), but re-created in 1921 with its seat first at Bautzen and now at the Katholische Hofkirche in Dresden.

The Margraviate of Meissen was founded in 968 as well, with the city as the capital of the Margraves of Meissen. A market town by 1000, Meissen passed to the Duchy of Poland in 1002 under Boleslaw I the Brave, afterwards into hands of Henry II a few months later and the House of Wettin in 1089. In 1015 Meissen was besieged by the Poles led by future King Mieszko II. The city was at the forefront of the Ostsiedlung, or intensive German settlement of the rural Slavic lands east of the Elbe, and its reception of city rights dates to 1332.

The construction of Meissen Cathedral was begun in 1260 on the same hill as the Albrechtsburg castle. The resulting lack of space led to the cathedral being one of the smallest cathedrals in Europe. The church is also known as being one of the purest examples of Gothic architecture.

In 1423 Meissen became capital of the Electorate of Saxony. In 1464 the capital was moved to Dresden.

In 1759 the Austrians defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Meissen.

During World War II, a subcamp of Flossenbürg concentration camp was located in Meissen. 

Porcelain

Meissen is famous for the manufacture of porcelain, based on extensive local deposits of china clay (kaolin) and potter's clay (potter's earth). Meissen porcelain was the first high quality porcelain to be produced outside of the Orient.

The first European porcelain was manufactured in Meissen in 1710, when by decree of King Augustus II the Strong the Royal-Polish and Electoral-Saxon Porcelain Factory (Königlich-Polnische und Kurfürstlich-Sächsische Porzellan-Manufaktur)  was opened in the Albrechtsburg. In 1861, it was moved to the Triebisch river valley of Meissen, where the porcelain factory can still be found today. Along with porcelain, other ceramics are also manufactured.

Main sights

The Albrechtsburg, the former residence of the House of Wettin, is regarded as being the first castle to be used as a royal residence in the German-speaking world. Built between 1472 and 1525, it is a fine example of late Gothic style. It was redecorated in the 19th century with a range of murals depicting Saxon history. Today the castle is a museum. Nearby is the 13th-century Gothic Meissen Cathedral (Meißner Dom), whose chapel is one of the most famous burial places of the Wettin family.  The hill on which the castle and the cathedral are built offers a view over the roofs of the old town.

Meissen's historical district is located mostly around the market at the foot of the castle hill. It contains many buildings of Renaissance architecture. Also imposing is the view from the 57 metre high tower of the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady), situated in the old market-place. This church, not to be confused with the Dresden Frauenkirche, was first mentioned in a 1205 deed issued by Bishop Dietrich II and after a blaze about 1450 rebuilt in the Late Gothic style of a hall church. Its tower hosts the world's first porcelain carillon, manufactured in 1929 on the occasion of the town's 1000-years-jubilee. Another popular tourist sight is the world-famous Meissen porcelain factory.

From spring to autumn, several festivals take place in Meissen, such as the pottery market or the Weinfest, which celebrates the wine harvest. Meissen wine is produced at the vineyards in the river valley (Elbtal) around the town, part of the Saxonian wine region, one of the northernmost in Europe.

Running Bear
""Running Bear"" is a song written by J. P. Richardson (aka The Big Bopper) and sung most famously by Johnny Preston in 1959. The 1959 recording featured background vocals by Richardson and George Jones and the session's producer Bill Hall, who provided the ""Indian chanting"" of ""uga-uga"" during the three verses, as well as the ""Indian war cries"" at the start and end of the record. It was No. 1 for three weeks in January 1960 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. The song also reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart in 1960. Coincidentally, ""Running Bear"" was immediately preceded in the Hot 100 No. 1 position by Marty Robbins' ""El Paso"", another song in which the protagonist dies. Billboard ranked ""Running Bear"" as the No. 4 song of 1960. 

Richardson was a friend of Preston and offered ""Running Bear"" to him after hearing him perform in a club. Preston recorded the song at the Gold Star Studios in Houston, Texas in 1958. The saxophone was played by Link Davis.

Preston was signed to Mercury Records, and ""Running Bear"" was released in August 1959, seven months after Richardson's death in the plane crash that also killed Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens.

""Running Bear"" was used in the 1994 movie A Simple Twist of Fate, which stars Steve Martin as Michael McCann, a fine furniture maker in rural Virginia, who adopts a little girl named Mathilda. There is a scene in the movie where he plays ""Running Bear"" on the phonograph / record player, and he and Mathilda are dancing to the song. It occurs about midway through the movie.

Plot

The song tells the story of Running Bear, a ""young Indian brave"", and Little White Dove, an ""Indian maid"". The two are in love but are separated by two factors:

* Their tribes' hatred of each other: their respective tribes are at war. (""Their tribes fought with each other / So their love could never be."")
* A raging river: a physical separation but also as a metaphor for their cultural separation.

The two, longing to be together, despite the obstacles and the risks posed by the river, dive into the raging river to unite. After sharing a passionate kiss, they are pulled down by the swift current and drown. The lyrics describe their fate: ""Now they'll always be together / In their happy hunting ground.""

Cover versions

In 1960, the Dutch group Het Cocktail Trio recorded a version of the song called Grote Beer ('Great Bear', but also 'Ursa Maior') about an Indian who travels in space. 

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Sonny James enjoyed an unprecedented streak of success with his commercially released singles, many of them covers of previous pop hits. One of his 16 consecutive No. 1 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart was a cover version of ""Running Bear."" Released in April 1969, James topped the Hot Country Singles chart in mid-June and spent three weeks at No. 1.   The song soon was one of James' most popular recordings of his career.

Jim Stallings recorded a version of the song on his 1969 album entitled Heya!

The Youngbloods released a version of the song as a single in 1972  and was featured on their album High on a Ridge Top. 

The Guess Who included the song on their 1972 album Rockin', although the songwriting credit is incorrectly given to Clarence ""Curly"" Herdman, a country and bluegrass fiddler.

Danny Davis and the Nashville Brass recorded a toe-tapping version of the song, complete with the standard Nashville Brass banjo-and-steel solo, for their 1975 album Dream Country.

Mud recorded the song on their 1974 debut album Mud Rock which reached #8 in the UK charts.

Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys  frequently performed the song and it appears their album Time Changes Everything, and on many greatest hits compilations.

In 2012 Ray Stevens covered the song on his 9-CD box set, The Encyclopedia of Recorded Comedy Music.

Northern Irish punk band, Stiff Little Fingers did a live cover of this, which ended up on their album All the Best and later on the re-issue of their live album, Hanx!.

A German version titled Brauner Bär und Weiße Taube (""Brown Bear and White Dove"") was recorded as a single by Gus Backus in 1960.  

The song was occasionally part of Led Zeppelin's live repertoire in the early 1970s, during rock medleys contained within long versions of ""Whole Lotta Love"". 

The song is a staple of Williams and Ree's live set and is one of the duo's most popular songs. Ree performs the lead vocals while Williams provides Indian chants and humorous alternatives, such as lyrics from Pump Up The Jam and Ice Ice Baby.

Passage:
Pearl Roundabout
Pearl Roundabout or Lulu Roundabout (Arabic:  ', ""Roundabout of the pearl(s)"") was a roundabout located near the financial district of Manama, Bahrain. The roundabout was named after the pearl monument that previously stood on the site and was destroyed on March 18, 2011 by government forces as part of a crackdown on protesters during the Bahraini uprising (2011–present).

Location

The roundabout was located in the heart of the capital Manama and was surrounded by the Bahrain Central Market, Marina, Pearl and City Center Roundabout as well the Abraj Al Lulu (Pearl Towers) apartment complex, which is named after the Pearl Monument. Also near the destroyed roundabout are some of the city's major remaining landmarks, including the Bahrain World Trade Center and the Bahrain Financial Harbour.

The roundabout served originally as a major traffic intersection for routes into the capital city, although it is now bypassed by a flyover and junction complex built as part of Bahrain's 2030 modernization plan.

Pearl Monument

The Pearl Monument previously stood in the center of the circle, having been erected in 1982 on the occasion of the third summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which was hosted by Bahrain for the first time in Manama on November 9–11 of that year. 

Symbols and representation

The Pearl Monument consisted of six dhow ""sails"" projecting up to the sky, which came together to hold a pearl at the top. The six sails designated the Gulf Cooperation Council's six member nations, while the pearl symbolized their united heritage and the country's famous history of pearl cultivation.   At the base of the monument was a dodecagonal pool with fountain jets. The Pearl Monument is featured on the face of the Bahraini half-dinar coin, the highest value coin in Bahraini currency.   The Central Bank of Bahrain reportedly asked banks to exchange their half-dinar coins for half-dinar banknotes after the Pearl Monument was destroyed.   The coin is no longer minted or distributed by the Central Bank of Bahrain. 

Demolition

On the morning of March 18, 2011, the government tore down the Pearl Monument, announcing on state broadcaster BTV that the monument had been ""violated"" and ""desecrated"" by the ""vile"" anti-government protests, and had to be ""cleansed.""  In the government's haste, a migrant crane worker was crushed to death by a falling cement arch.

Bahraini uprising (2011–present)

The Pearl Roundabout was the site of demonstrations during 2011, which began in February. It has been compared by the protesters to Cairo's Tahrir Square, the main site of demonstrations during the 2011 Egyptian revolution.

On 15 February 2011, after the funeral procession of Mr Ali Mushaima, more people joined the demonstrators and moved towards the Pearl Roundabout, where they arrived at around 15:00. By 15:15, demonstrators began to set up tents at the roundabout, and later in the day a projector screen was installed. Among these was a tent erected by members of the SMC medical staff. There were also a number of demonstrators obstructing traffic in the roundabout overpass. By nightfall, the number of demonstrators had reached several thousand. The roundabout and its immediate vicinity were congested with protesters and private vehicles. Police in the area neither engaged the demonstrators nor did they attempt to disperse them. King Hamad had ordered that members of the procession be allowed to occupy the Pearl Roundabout to express their sadness. 

On 17 February 2011, while demonstrators were spending the night at the Pearl Roundabout, police forces entered the location at 3:00 in an attempt to disperse protesters. The crackdown led to many injuries as well as the death of at least four civilians (See Bloody Thursday (2011)). 

Soon after the police crackdown on demonstrators, Bahraini police official Al-Hassan appeared on national television to explain the previous night's events. Al-Hassan argued that demonstrators were warned beforehand and that they refused to leave the area. He also added that demonstrators were actually in possession of weapons such as knives and pistols.   The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, established by King Hamad of Bahrain to prepare a report on the events on February and March saw no evidence to suggest that protesters at the roundabout were armed. 

Soon after the police crackdown, Bahrain Defense Force tanks occupied Pearl Roundabout to stop demonstrators from occupying the area.   Some demonstrators who stayed close to Salmaniya Hospital where injured demonstrators were being assisted tried to retake Pearl Roundabout and headed towards the area. Demonstrators were shot by forces camping in Pearl Roundabout. 

Following these events, the Crown Prince of Bahrain Salman Al Khalifa came on Bahrain state television and demanded calm of all parties.   The following day, he ordered the military tanks to leave the Pearl Monument and protesters were allowed to occupy the area peacefully and were guaranteed by the Crown Prince that they would be able to demonstrate without any further attacks.   On March 16, however, the protesters' camp in the roundabout was evacuated, bulldozed, and set on fire by the Bahraini Defense Force, riot police, and Peninsula Shield Force,   two days before the Pearl Monument was demolished. An expatriate crane operator was crushed to death during the demolition by a piece of the monument which fell onto his crane cabin. 

Al Farooq Junction

After demolishing the Pearl Monument, the government announced that the roundabout would be replaced with traffic lights, possibly to ease congestion in the financial district.   The government changed the name of the site to Al Farooq Junction, a reference to Umar ibn al-Khattab, a historical figure revered by Sunnis and considered by Shiites to be against their cause.  The name of Al Farooq was given to the junction as well as the military operation by Khalifa Bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, the head of security forces and a member of the royal family. 

As of 25 February 2015, the public has been restricted from accessing Al Farooq Junction.  The area has been sealed off by security forces since protesters were cleared from the Pearl Roundabout on 16 March 2011.

Passage:
Osmotherley, North Yorkshire
Osmotherley is an English village and civil parish, situated in the Hambleton hills in North Yorkshire.  The village is the western edge of the North York Moors National Park. 

Osmotherley is on the route of the 110 mile Cleveland Way National Trail.

Origin of name

It is likely that Osmotherley means the clearing or 'ley' (pronounced lee), belonging to a Viking called 'Asmund' or a Saxon called 'Osmund'. There have been a number spellings of the Osmotherley over the centuries: the name appeared in the Domesday Book as Asmundrelac; it has also been known as Osmundeslay and Osmonderlay.

However, fanciful local legend says that Osmotherley was named after the mother of a villager named Oswald or Osmund, who supposedly went out to gather firewood in the winter. When she did not return her son became anxious and went out to look for her. He found her lying in the snow, dead or dying from the cold. Because he was not able to carry her back, he lay down beside her and died himself. It is where Oswald's mother lies, hence Osmotherley.

Governance

An  electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches both north and south from the village with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 1,764. 
Amenities

The village school was founded 1857, the present building dates from 1878. The school is now known as Osmotherley Primary School. It is located on School Lane and has 49 pupils.

Osmotherley boasts three pubs within a 55 yd radius: the [http://www.queencatherinehotel.co.uk Queen Catherine], the [http://www.threetunsrestaurant.co.uk Three Tuns] and the [http://www.goldenlionosmotherley.co.uk Golden Lion]. The village was featured on BBC News and Sky News during the Wedding of Prince William of Wales and Catherine Middleton, as it is the only village in the country to boast a pub with the name 'Queen Catherine'.

The village is served by a newsagents, a 'Top Shop' store, a fish and chip shop, a Youth Hostel and an antique store.

The shop that has served Osmotherley since 1786, 'Thompson', along with a recently opened Art and Craft Shop have recently closed.

The public toilets are situated by the side of the Village Hall (which in turn is next to Church House, which hosts book sales and tea sales on Sundays and Bank Holidays.) These toilets have been voted the best in the UK on several occasions and are filled with flowers and decorated with pictures of horses.

Religion

The Church of England parish church is dedicated to St Peter and is built on an earlier Saxon site, with parts of the building dating from the Norman period. Largely rebuilt by architect C. Hodgson Fowler in 1892, it is a grade II* listed building. 

John Wesley preached at the barter table in the middle of Osmotherley on several occasions, the first in 1745. In 1754 a Methodist Chapel was erected in Chapel Yard.

Osmotherley is also home to Osmotherley Friends Meeting House, which is a traditional stone building, erected in 1690 or 1723. Meetings are still held here once a month. It is thought that George Fox may have visited the village in the late 17th century.

Nearby

Cod Beck Reservoir at Osmotherley gets its name from Cod Beck, a small tributary of the River Swale. The beck derives its name from the Celtic word 'Coed', meaning woody. Just before Cod Beck reaches the reservoir is a picturesque location called Sheepwash.

Osmotherley is close to the western terminus of the Lyke Wake Walk.  The official starting point is at the edge of the moors above the village, where there is a stone marker.

About 1½ miles from Osmotherley near the A19 is Mount Grace Priory. These beautiful ruins are situated at the foot of a steep wooded hill with a footpath leading up it into the village. This Carthusian religious house was founded around 1396.

In popular culture

Osmotherley is the setting of some of the final chapters of the novel Brother in the Land by Robert Swindells. In the novel, many towns and cities in it are hit by individually programmed nuclear missiles, but Osmotherley's small size means it is spared.
Question:
Which walking path runs for 42 miles from Osmotherley to Ravenscar?

Passage:
Tagus
The Tagus (; ; ; Ancient Greek: Τάγος Tagos) is the longest river on the Iberian Peninsula.  It is 1038 km long, 716 km in Spain, 47 km along the border between Portugal and Spain and 275 km in Portugal, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean near Lisbon.  It drains an area of 80100 sqkm (the second largest in the Iberian peninsula after the Douro).  The Tagus is highly utilized for most of its course. Several dams and diversions supply drinking water to most of central Spain, including Madrid, and Portugal, while dozens of hydroelectric stations create power. Between dams it follows a very constricted course, but after Almourol it enters a vast alluvial valley prone to flooding. At its mouth is a large estuary on which the port city of Lisbon is situated.

The source of the Tagus is the Fuente de García, in the Frías de Albarracín municipal term, Montes Universales, Sistema Ibérico, Sierra de Albarracín Comarca. All its major tributaries enter the Tagus from the right (north) bank.  The main cities it passes through are Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera de la Reina and Alcántara in Spain, and Abrantes, Santarém, Almada and Lisbon in Portugal.

Course

In Spain

The first notable city on the Tagus is Sacedón. Below Aranjuez it receives the combined flow of the Jarama,  Henares, Algodor and Tajuña.  Below Toledo it receives the Guadarrama River.  Above Talavera de la Reina it receives the Alberche.  At Valdeverdeja is the upper end of the long upper reservoir, the Embalse de Valdecañas, beyond which are the Embalse de Torrejon, into which flow the Tiétar, and the lower reservoir, the Alcántara Dam into which flows the Alagón at the lower end.

There is a canal and aqueduct between the Tagus and the Segura.

In Portugal

After forming the border it enters Portugal, passing Vila Velha de Ródão, Abrantes, Constância, Entroncamento, Santarém and Vila Franca de Xira at the head of the long narrow estuary, which has Lisbon at its mouth. The estuary is protected by the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve. There is the largest bridge across the river, the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which with a total length of  is the longest bridge in Europe.

The Portuguese Alentejo region and former Ribatejo Province take their names from the river; Alentejo, from além Tejo ""Beyond the Tagus"" and Ribatejo from arriba Tejo, an archaic way of saying ""Upper Tagus"".

Geology

The lower Tagus is on a fault line. Slippage along it has caused numerous earthquakes, the major ones being those of 1309, 1531 and 1755. 

History

The Pepper Wreck, properly the wreck of the Nossa Senhora dos Mártires, is a shipwreck located and excavated at the mouth of the Tagus between 1996 and 2001.

The river had strategic value to the Spanish and Portuguese empires, as it guarded the approach to Lisbon. For example, in 1587, Sir Francis Drake briefly approached the river after his successful raid at Cadiz. 

Popular culture

A major river, the Tagus is brought to mind in the songs and stories of the Portuguese. A popular fado song in Lisbon notes that while people get older, the Tagus remains young (""My hair getting white, the Tagus is always young""). The author, Fernando Pessoa, wrote a poem that begins: 
""The Tagus is more beautiful than the river that flows through my village. But the Tagus is not more beautiful than the river that flows through my village..."" 

Richard Crashaw's poem ""Saint Mary Magdalene, or the Weeper"" refers to the ""Golden"" Tagus as wanting Mary Magdalene's silver tears. In classical poetry the Tagus was famous for its gold-bearing sands (Catullus 29.19, Ovid, Amores, 1.15.34, Juvenal, Satires, 3.55, etc.).
Question:
Which European capital city is on the River Tagus?
Answer:
Capital of Portugal
Passage:
Blondi
Blondi (1941 – 29 April 1945)Some sources incorrectly suggest 1934 as Blondi's date of birth.   was Adolf Hitler's German Shepherd, a gift as a puppy   from Martin Bormann in 1941. Blondi stayed with Hitler even after his move into the Führerbunker located underneath the garden of the Reich Chancellery on 16 January 1945. 

Hitler was reportedly very fond of Blondi, keeping her by his side and allowing her to sleep in his bedroom in the bunker. This affection was not shared by Eva Braun, Hitler's companion (and later his wife), who preferred her two Scottish Terrier dogs named Negus and Stasi (or Katuschka).   According to Hitler's secretary (Traudl Junge), Eva came to hate Blondi and was known to kick her under the dining table. 

Blondi played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover. Dogs like Blondi were coveted as ""germanischer Urhund"", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Third Reich. 

Blondi's puppies

In March   or in early April   (likely 4 April)  1945, she had a litter of five puppies with Gerdy Troost's German Shepherd, Harras. Hitler named one of the puppies ""Wulf"", his favorite nickname and the meaning of his own first name, Adolf (Noble wolf)  and he began to train her.  One of Blondi's puppies was reserved for Eva Braun's sister Gretl. Eva sent Gretl a letter containing a photo of Blondi and three of her puppies, Gretl's being indicated with an arrow. 

Other dogs

During his military service in World War I, Hitler had great affection for a stray white Fox Terrier named ""Fuchsl"" and was distraught when he lost him. 

He had been given a German Shepherd before named ""Prinz"" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed. 

He also owned a German Shepherd called ""Muckl"". 

Before Blondi, Hitler had two German Shepherd dogs, a mother [born 1926] and daughter [born ca. 1930] – both named Blonda. In some photos taken during the 1930s the younger Blonda is incorrectly labeled as Blondi (in most cases photograph descriptions were written later).

In May 1942, Hitler bought another young German Shepherd ""from a minor official in the post office in Ingolstadt""  to keep Blondi company. He called her Bella. 

Death of Blondi and other dogs

During the course of 29 April 1945, Hitler learned of the death of his ally Benito Mussolini, who had been executed by Italian partisans. This, along with the fact the Soviet Army was closing in on his location, led Hitler to strengthen his resolve not to allow himself or his wife to be captured. That afternoon, Hitler expressed doubts about the cyanide capsules he had received through Heinrich Himmler's SS.  To verify the capsules' potency, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test them on his dog Blondi, and the dog died as a result.  Hitler became completely inconsolable. 

According to a report commissioned by Joseph Stalin and based on eye-witness accounts, Hitler's dog-handler, Feldwebel Fritz Tornow, took Blondi's pups and shot them in the garden of the bunker complex on 30 April, after Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide. He also killed Eva Braun's two dogs, Frau Gerda Christian's dogs and his own dachshund. Tornow was later captured by the Allies.  Hitler's nurse, Erna Flegel, said in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide.  After the battle in Berlin ended, the remains of Hitler, Braun, and two dogs (thought to be Blondi and her offspring Wulf) were discovered in a shell crater by a unit of SMERSH, the Soviet counter-intelligence agency.   The dog thought to be Blondi was exhumed and photographed by the Soviets.

Don't Go Breaking My Heart
""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" is a duet by Elton John and Kiki Dee. It was written by Elton John with Bernie Taupin under the pseudonyms ""Ann Orson"" and ""Carte Blanche"" (a pun on the expression ""an horse and cart, blanche""), respectively, and intended as an affectionate pastiche of the Motown style, notably the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye and singers such as Tammi Terrell and Kim Weston. It is not to be confused with the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song of the same title recorded in 1965 by Dionne Warwick for the album Here I Am.

John and Taupin originally intended to record the song with Dusty Springfield, but ultimately withdrew the offer; Dusty's partner Sue Cameron later said this was because she was too ill at the time.  

Chart performance

Writers John and Taupin received the 1981 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. 

Unlike many of John's singles from the 1970s, it was never included on an original album (although it was recorded during the Blue Moves sessions), but was subsequently in released as the third single on the album Duets, in early 1994. This version of the song was recorded with RuPaul, and the album included another duet with Kiki Dee, Cole Porter's ""True Love.""

""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" was the first No. 1 single in the UK for both John and Kiki Dee, topping the chart for six weeks in mid 1976. John would not enjoy a solo British chart-topper until ""Sacrifice"" in 1990. It also became his sixth No. 1 single in the US, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks and spent one week on the Easy Listening chart.  Billboard ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1976.  In the U.S. it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.   After this duet with Dee, John failed to have another #1 single, without sharing the top song with other credited artists, until his 1997 smash Candle In The Wind 1997.  This 21-year ""Kiki jinx"" included two intervening #1 hits in America for John: ""That's What Friends Are For"" by Dionne & Friends in 1986; and, a 1992 re-make of John's ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me"" with George Michael credited as a duet.

The B-side, ""Snow Queen"", was supposedly inspired by Cher, with John's improvising of past Sonny & Cher hits ""I Got You Babe"" and ""The Beat Goes On"", as well as the solo Cher song ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"" during the fadeout of the song.

In 1977, John guest starred on The Muppet Show and performed the track with Miss Piggy. In 1985, John and Dee performed the track to the crowd at Wembley Stadium during John's set at Live Aid (where Dee sang backup). In 1987, John appeared with Minnie Mouse on the NBC series Totally Minnie miming to the track. He performed the track with Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan) at the 2001 British Comedy awards. He also performed it with the Spice Girls on his ITV tribute programme An Audience with... Elton John.

In June 2013, 37 years after its original release, the single reached one million sales in the UK.  

Availability

The song can be found on Elton John's Greatest Hits Volume II (1977)  and Greatest Hits 1976–1986; the 1995 UK CD of Rock of the Westies includes it as a bonus track (the US edition did not, however). In 2002, it also appeared on John's 2-disc greatest hits album, Elton John's Greatest Hits 1970-2002. A demo version of the song was recorded by John as a solo artist. This version has not been released commercially.

The History behind Old MacDonald had A Farm
The History behind Old MacDonald had A Farm
Have you ever wondered what is the history behind some famous nursery rhymes?
Today we made a small survey for you about one of our favorite nursery rhyme-The “Old McDonald!
Here’s what we found out!
The first versions of this song appeared in 1917 and was originally called “Old MacDougal”
The song “Old MacDougal” went something like this:
Old MacDougal had a farm in Ohio-i-o,
And on that farm he had some dogs in Ohio-i-o,
With a bow-wow here, and a bow-wow there,
Here a bow, there a wow, everywhere a bow-wow.
There was one other that was called “Old Missouri” from 1922 according to the bookOzark Folksongs, by Vance Randolph in 1980.
There are also other versions or variants which were published that date back even further than 1917. Take for example “The Farmyard” dating to 1908. This went like this:
Up was I on my father’s farm
On a May day morning early,
Feeding of my father’s cows
On a May day morning early,
With a moo moo here and a moo moo there,
Here a moo, there a moo, Here a pretty moo.
Six pretty maids come and gang along o’ me
To the merry green fields of the farm-yard.
 
Old MacDonald Had A Farm Lyrics:
Old MacDonald had a farm (E-I-E-I-O),
And on that farm he had a cow (E-I-E-I-O),
With a Moo Moo here and a Moo Moo there,
Here a Moo there Moo everywhere a Moo, Moo.
Old MacDonald had a farm (E-I-E-I-O),
And on that farm he had a sheep (E-I-E-I-O),
And on that farm he had a pig (E-I-E-I-O),
And on that farm he had some ducks (E-I-E-I-O),
And on that farm he had a horse (E-I-E-I-O),
Old MacDonald had a farm (E-I-E-I-O),

Passage:
Percy Spencer
Percy Lebaron Spencer (July 19, 1894 – September 8, 1969) was an American physicist and inventor. He became known as the inventor of the microwave oven. 

Early life

Spencer was born in Howland, Maine. Eighteen months later, Spencer's father died, and his mother soon left him in the care of his aunt and uncle. His uncle then died when Spencer was just seven years old. Spencer subsequently left grammar school to earn money to support himself and his aunt. From the ages of twelve to sixteen, he worked from sunrise to sunset at a spool mill. At the latter age, he discovered that a local paper mill was soon to begin using electricity, a concept little known in his rural home region, and he accordingly began learning as much as possible about the phenomenon. Therefore, when he applied to work at the mill, he was one of three people hired to install electricity in the plant, despite never having received any formal training in electrical engineering or even finishing grammar school. At the age of 18, Spencer decided to join the U.S. Navy. He had become interested in wireless communications after learning about the wireless operators aboard the Titanic when it sank. While with the navy, he made himself an expert on radio technology: ""I just got hold of a lot of textbooks and taught myself while I was standing watch at night."" He also subsequently taught himself trigonometry, calculus, chemistry, physics, and metallurgy, among other subjects. 

Career

By 1939, Spencer became one of the world’s leading experts in radar tube design. Spencer was worked at Raytheon, a contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense, as the chief of the power tube division. Largely due to his reputation and expertise, Spencer managed to help Raytheon win a government contract to develop and produce combat radar equipment for M.I.T.’s Radiation Laboratory. This was of huge importance to the Allies and became the military’s second highest priority project during WWII, behind the Manhattan Project. At that time, magnetrons were used to generate the microwave radio signals that are the core mechanism of radar, and they were being made at the rate of 17 per day at Raytheon. While working there, Spencer developed a more efficient way to manufacture them, by punching out and soldering together magnetron parts, rather than using machined parts. It also saw Spencer’s staff rise from 15 employees to 5,000 over the course of the next few years. His improvements were among those that increased magnetron production to 2,600 per day. For his work, he was awarded the Distinguished Public Service Award by the U.S. Navy.

One day while building magnetrons, Spencer was standing in front of an active radar set when he noticed the candy bar he had in his pocket had melted. Spencer was not the first to notice this phenomenon, but he was the first to investigate it. He decided to experiment using food, including popcorn kernels, which became the world’s first microwaved popcorn. In another experiment, an egg was placed in a tea kettle, and the magnetron was placed directly above it. The result was the egg exploding in the face of one of his co-workers, who was looking in the kettle to observe. Spencer then created the first true microwave oven by attaching a high density electromagnetic field generator to an enclosed metal box. The magnetron emitted microwaves into the metal box blocking any escape, allowing for controlled and safe experimentation. He then placed various food items in the box, while observing effects and monitoring temperatures.

Raytheon filed a patent on October 8, 1945 for a microwave cooking oven, eventually named the Radarange. In 1947, the first commercially produced microwave oven was about 6 feet tall, weighed about 750 lbs, and cost between $2,000 and $3,000. In 1967 the first relatively affordable ($495) and reasonably sized (counter-top) microwave oven was available for sale.

Spencer became Senior Vice President and a Senior Member of the Board of Directors at Raytheon. He received 300 patents during his career, and a building at the Raytheon Missile Defense Center in Woburn, Massachusetts is named in his honor.  Other awards and achievements Spencer achieved, besides the Distinguished Public Service Award, included a membership of the Institute of Radio Engineers, Fellowship in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and an honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Massachusetts, despite having no formal education.

For his invention, Spencer received no royalties, but he was paid a one-time $2.00 gratuity from Raytheon, the same token payment the company made to all inventors on its payroll at that time for company patents. 

Personal life

Spencer and his wife, Louise, had three children: John, James, and George. He counted Vannevar Bush, Omar Bradley, William Redington Hewlett and David Packard as friends. Later, he was married to Lillian Ottenheimer on November 18, 1960.

Legacy

Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, which deals extensively in radar systems, has named a building after Spencer in the Woburn, Massachusetts facility. An early Radarange model sits in the lobby, across from the dining center.
Question:
In what year did Percy L. Spencer invent the microwave?
Answer:
one thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven
Passage:
Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd
The Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd (, '), initially the Kingdom of Hejaz and Sultanate of Nejd (, '), was a dual monarchy ruled by Ibn Saud following the victory of the Saudi Sultanate of Nejd over the Hashemite Kingdom of the Hejaz in 1925. In 1932 the two kingdoms were unified as Saudi Arabia.

History

On 8 January 1926, Ibn Saud, the Sultan of Nejd, was crowned King of the Hejaz in the Masjid al-Haram in Makkah, and he elevated Nejd to the status of a kingdom on 29 January 1927.  At the Treaty of Jeddah on 20 May 1927, Ibn Saud's realm was recognised by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and was addressed as the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd.

For the next five years, Ibn Saud administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units. On 23 September 1932, the main Saudi dominions of Al-Hasa, Qatif, Nejd and the Hejaz were unified as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Foreign policy 

The Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd could pursue its expansionist policy by British arms supplies because of its close relations with the United Kingdom. Under Ibn Saud, the Hejaz withdrew from the League of Nations.

In 1926, the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd was recognised by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, followed by the United States of America in 1931. By 1932, the United Kingdom, the USSR, Turkey, the Imperial State of Iran and The Netherlands maintained legations in Jeddah; The French Third Republic, the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Egypt maintained unofficial consular representatives.

Eclipse Stakes
|}

The Eclipse Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at Sandown Park over a distance of 1 mile, 2 furlongs and 7 yards (2,018 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in early July.

History

The event is named after Eclipse, a celebrated 18th-century racehorse. It was established in 1886, and the inaugural running was won by Bendigo. At that time, it was Britain's richest ever race.  The prize fund of £10,000 was donated by Leopold de Rothschild at the request of General Owen Williams, a co-founder of Sandown Park.

The Eclipse Stakes was contested by high-quality fields from its inception. It was won by Ayrshire, the previous year's Derby winner, in 1889. The first three finishers in 1903 — Ard Patrick, Sceptre and Rock Sand — had won seven Classics between them.

The race has been sponsored by Coral since 1976, and it is now familiarly known as the ""Coral-Eclipse"". The most recent Classic winner to achieve victory was Golden Horn in 2015.

Passage:
BBC - Comedy - The League Of Gentlemen
BBC - Comedy - The League Of Gentlemen
The League Of Gentlemen
The League Of Gentlemen
We all need to be jealous of something. The League of Gentlemen must be near the top of the tree of ideas other comedians wish they'd had first. But Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson thought of it -so to them, the glory.
The story of a simple Northern village where everyone keeps themselves to themselves and people like to keep things 'local', The League of Gentlemen is one of the most powerful comic formats ever created.
Along with The Fast Show, it made the sketch format 'cool' after the genre spending years in the wilderness. Without The League, there would have been - almost without a doubt - no Little Britain.
At times genuinely moving, at others so profoundly disturbing and shocking that it transcends traditional comedy, most of the time TLOG is just extremely funny, biting and brilliantly, dramatically written - the classiest sketch-based format written in recent broadcasting history.
Starting as a revue format at Edinburgh and then vaulting onto radio, The League of Gentlemen is a sketch show, although it is also a sitcom - particularly in its television guise.
In the village of Royston Vasey, various characters mostly played by Gatiss, Pemberton and Shearsmith inhabit a dark world of secrets and offhand depravity.
The local butcher, Hilary Briss, serves a particular kind of 'special stuff' the nature of which is never discovered. German scoutleader Herr Lipp has questionable relations with his charges. Theatre troupe Legz Akimbo are led by the thoroughly inadequate Olly, whilst sadistic restart officer Pauline rules her charges with a mixture of cruelty and contempt. The Dentons worship toads and condemn self-abuse. Cab driver Barbara is never seen but is always saving up for her/his/its 'operation'.
Most appalling and most famous, however, are characters such as Papa Lazarou, the owner of a traveling circus whose catchphrase 'Hello Dave?' looks innocent on paper but which sounds utterly disgusting, and Tubbs and Edward, who run the 'Local Shop for Local People', fiercely hate outsiders, and at least in the TV version of the show, both show pronounced inbred, piglike noses.
Most formats that travel from radio to television, especially dark, imaginative formats such as The League, suffer because the mind tends to be able to 'do' things with the characters which reality can't match.
But the imaginations of the League, as well as Producer Gemma Rogers and Director Steve Bendelack, gave visual life to the League's monsters in far more horrifying, though comic, form than virtually anyone could have pictured on radio.
On radio, too, the series was more obviously 'sketches' - mainly owing to being performed live. Most of the TV series was made, however, on location and then screened for the audience.
The result is that although there's a laughter track, it's hardly noticeable, and doesn't interfere with the scenes - allowing The League to become its own world much more effectively.
Three series of The League were produced, with the BBC not closing the door on a fourth.
The first series saw the inhabitants reacting badly to a road being built through the town; the second saw plenty of deaths owing to a rash of nosebleeds. The first two series were both massively popular and cultish at the same time, winning a BAFTA, a Royal Television Society Award and a Golden Rose at Montreux.
The third series, however, took a different turn, with the characters all involved in a skein of stories which all interlinked into a larger narrative. The creators were getting frustrated with their characters and situations, and imprisoned within them - and this was made even plainer in the film version of the series, The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse, in which Royston Vasey is destroyed after a series of adventures between our world and that of the series.
Debates about the slightly less popular third series and the film remain rife - with diehard fans of the 'proper' League wishing that the creators had simply stuck to their original idea.
This, however, misses the point - which is that it was that need to create truly original characters that drove the League in the first place, and you can't stuff that genie back in the bottle. Whether they do another series or something completely new, it will be startling, and different - not just the old stuff redone.

Passage:
Newmarket Racecourse
Newmarket Racecourse, which has a capacity of 45,000,  is a British Thoroughbred horse racing venue in the town of Newmarket, Suffolk.  Newmarket is often referred to as the headquarters of British horseracing and is home to the largest cluster of training yards in the country and many key horse racing organisations, including Tattersalls, the National Horseracing Museum and the National Stud.  The racecourse hosts two of the country's five Classic Races - the 1,000 Guineas and 2,000 Guineas, and numerous other Group races.  In total, it hosts 9 of British racing's 32 annual Group 1 races.

History

Racing in Newmarket was recorded in the time of James I.  Charles II was known to attend races on Newmarket Heath with his brother, the future James II.  Up until 1744, the two most valuable races run at the course were the King's Plate and the Town Plate.  Two more Plate races were added in that year, paid for by local traders, both worth 50 guineas - one was a race for five-year-olds carrying 9 stone, one was an open age race in four mile heats.  Another paid for by landowners was a four-year-old race over four miles, each carrying 8 stone 7 lbs.  At that time, formal races at Newmarket only took place twice a year - once in April, once in October.  A second Spring meeting was added in 1753.

By 1840, there were seven annual meetings:

*The Craven Meeting - a week, beginning Easter Monday (inaugurated 1771)
*1st Spring Meeting - a week, beginning Easter Monday fortnight (inaugurated pre-1744)
*2nd Spring Meeting - a week, beginning Easter Monday month (inaugurated 1753)
*July Meeting - a few days, around 10 July (inaugurated 1765)
*1 October Meeting - a week, beginning Monday before the first Thursday in October (inaugurated pre-1744)
*2 October Meeting - a week, beginning Monday before the third Thursday in October (inaugurated 1762)
*Houghton Meeting - a few days, beginning two weeks later (inaugurated in 1770)

Layout

Newmarket, in fact, has two courses - the Rowley Mile Course and the July Course. Both are wide, galloping tracks used for Flat racing only.

*The Rowley Mile Course has a 1 mile 2 furlong (2 km) straight with minor undulations towards 'The Bushes', two furlongs (400 m) out. The penultimate furlong (200 m) is downhill and the last is uphill, forming 'The Dip'. Races beyond the distance of 1m 2f start on the 'Cesarewitch' or 'Beacon' course which turns right-handed into the straight.
*The July Course, also sometimes called the Summer Course, has a 1 mile (1600 m) straight, known as 'The Bunbury Mile'. After 2 furlongs (400 m), there is a long downhill stretch before the uphill furlong (200 m) to the finish. This course also uses the 'Cesarewitch/Beacon' course for longer distances, again turning right into the straight.

Technically, there is also a third course, the Round Course, but this is only used once a year for the Newmarket Town Plate, a race of great historical significance, but limited importance in modern day racing.

The Rowley Mile is used for racing in the Spring and Autumn, while the July Course is used in Summer. The Rowley Mile has a grass strip used by light aircraft, and formerly by the Royal Air Force (RAF) as RAF Newmarket.

The Devil's Dyke runs past the edge of the July course. About half of the racecourse complex, including the July and Cesarewitch/Beacon courses, is actually in the neighbouring county of Cambridgeshire.

Historically, there are various names that have been given to courses or parts of courses at Newmarket, and some are still in use today to describe particular race distances.  Whyte's History of the British Turf (1840), for instance, lists the Beacon Course, Round Course, Audley End Course, Clermont Course, Ancaster Mile, Rowley Mile, Abingdon Mile, Banbury Mile, Ditch Mile and Yearling Course.

Notable races 

The King's Plate (or Queen's Plate) was a major race run between 1634 and 1765.

Screwdriver (cocktail)
A screwdriver is a popular alcoholic highball drink made with orange juice and vodka. While the basic drink is simply the two ingredients, there are many variations; the most common one is made with one part vodka, one part of any kind of orange soda, and one part of orange juice. Many of the variations have different names in different parts of the world. The International Bartender Association has designated this cocktail as an IBA Official Cocktail.

History

This drink appears in literature as early as 1938 ""And answered it 'The famous Smirnoff Screwdriver', Just pour a jigger of smirnoff vodka over ice cubes, fill glass with orange juice and serve"".   Then later it is claimed that this drink was invented by American aviators ""A Screwdriver —a half-orange-juice and half-vodka drink popularized by interned American aviators—costs a dollar including the customary barman's tip.""

A written reference to the screwdriver is from the October 24, 1949 issue of Time:

In the dimly lighted bar of the sleek Park Hotel, Turkish intelligence agents mingle with American engineers and Balkan refugees, drinking the latest Yankee concoction of vodka and orange juice, called a 'screwdriver'. 

Variations 

A screwdriver with two parts of Sloe Gin, and filled with orange juice is a ""Slow (Sloe) Screw"".

A screwdriver with two parts of Sloe Gin, one part of Southern Comfort and filled with orange juice is a ""Slow Comfortable Screw"". 

A screwdriver with one part of Sloe Gin, one part of Southern Comfort and one part Galliano and filled with orange juice is a ""Slow Comfortable Screw Up Against The Wall"". 

A screwdriver with two parts vodka, four parts orange juice, and one part Galliano is a Harvey Wallbanger.

A screwdriver with equal parts vanilla vodka and Blue Curaçao topped with lemon-lime soda is a ""Sonic Screwdriver"".
Question:
The Harvey Wall Banger cocktail contain Vodka, orange juice and what else?
Answer:
Galliano

Frank makes a good impression
27 March 2010 | by ShadeGrenade
(Ambrosia) – See all my reviews
When Frank Spencer drove into the sea on Christmas Day 1975, viewers must have thought they had seen the last ( repeats excluded ) of the accident-prone character. Michael Crawford was keen to move on to stage musicals. But, at the climax of a 1977 documentary entitled 'To Be Perfectly Frank' ( which basically was about how the stunts were performed ) the actor said: ""Although I have said I won't play Frank again, I wouldn't like to close any doors just yet...I miss him very much!"".
In early 1978, 'The Sun' reported that Crawford had been signed for a third run of 'Some Mothers'. Good news indeed. It also claimed Peter Cook and Dudley Moore were all set to revive 'Not Only But Also'. Very good news indeed. Well, one out of two was not bad.
Michael Mills having moved to Thames ( where he produced the successful 'Get Some In!' ), ex-'Porridge' producer Sydney Lotterby replaced him. Raymond Allen was still writing the scripts, but this time the credits carried an addition: 'Based On Stories By Michael Crawford'. Frank is basically the same, except for his vocabulary which seems to have expanded considerably since we last saw him, hence expressions such as ""we've been ejaculated from our home!"".
'Moving House' begins with the Spencers doing just that. The removal men are too nervous to venture upstairs, so Frank has to bring the furniture down himself. No sooner have they left their old home than it literally collapses. Betty's reckless driving means the removal van has to keep up, causing Frank to be buffeted about like a rag doll. Most of their belongings wind up on the road. Frank even falls into a barrel of tar at one point, and emerges looking like something out of 'Quatermass 2' ( he chats briefly to an Indian man played by Babar Bhatti - of 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum' - but this scene is missing from the D.V.D. release ).
Minus shirt, he goes to see Mr.Wright ( Glyn Houston ) to see about getting a phone installed in his shed. He fails. At 27 Sodbury Terrace, he turns the water back on, drenching neighbour Mr.Lewis ( Glynn Edwards ) who had been trying to unblock the sink...
I'm sure impressionists must have been horrified when they saw this opener and found Frank not wearing his trademark beret and mackintosh. Luckily, these returned in the very next episode. To promote the show, Crawford appeared on 'Bruce Forsyth & The Generation Game' the very evening it was broadcast. He was in character, and caused part of the set to fall down. Bruce remarked: ""I'll kill that Frank Spencer!"".
Ronnie Hazlehurst's theme has ( to emphasise this is a new show ) been augmented by a tuba.
Funniest moment - it is night time. Frank goes up into the loft, and falls head-first through his neighbour's ( Jean Boht ) ceiling, clutching the cat: ""Hello. I'm your new neighbour!"".

Question:
Which sitcom character lived at 27, Sodbury Terrace
Answer:
Frank Spencer
","['The Wanderer', 'Wanderer (disambiguation)', 'The Wanderer (album)', 'Wanderer', 'Wanderer (album)', 'The Wanderer (song)', 'Wanderers', 'The Wanderer (disambiguation)', 'WANDERERS', 'The wanderers', 'The Wanderers', 'The Wanderer (novel)', 'The Wanderers (novel)']",15481,triviaqa,en,,e12e382762b2f04c141b620a8ebca521a59d9b087216a0c9," Mohammed Azharuddin banned from cricket for life for his involvement in match fixing. Board of Control for Cricket in India, or BCCI, also announced bans for three other players. Ajay Jadeja, a middle-order batsman, Dr. Ali Irani, a physiotherapist, and Manoj Prabhakar all received five-year bans for their involvement with bookmakers. The report accused these players of having links with bookies and of ""under-performing"" in return for huge sums of money. The scandal began in India in 1997 when Prab Hakar wrote, in a signed article in a Delhi-based magazine, that he was offered 2.5 million rupees ($53,000) by a teammate to underperform in a match in Pakistan. The former India captain said he was being targeted because, as a Muslim, he belonged to the minority community, but he did not comment on the ban Tuesday.. The indictment may have the potential of becoming a socially explosive issue, but the situation may be defused by the fact that there are others being punished who do not belong to the minorities, a source says. The CBI devoted a full chapter of its report to the BCCI. The board has been under pressure since the release of a CBI report on match fixing in November, the report says. It says that while there was no evidence that any officials were involved in the match fixing, such a widespread racket was not possible without their knowledge. In a country where cricket means what soccer does in Europe, there has been a public outcry demanding punishment for the guilty. The BCCI says it will appeal against the punishment, and that it will take legal action against those involved in match-fixing as well as those who took part in the conspiracy to fix the match in the first place. The case is being investigated by India's National Cricket Academy, which is based in the capital, New Delhi, and the Supreme Court of India, where the case will be heard in December. The ban is expected to last for at least a year, according to a source at the National Cricket Association, which represents the Indian cricket team in the Cricket World Cup and other internationals in the event of a repeat of the scandal. Pradeep Magazine is the sports editor of India-Today.com. He asks: Who was the South African cricket captain who was banned for life in 2000 for his part in a match-fixing scandal? He also asks: What is the medical name for what is known as lentigines? And what is the birthstone that represents a person and can be worn as jewellery? He ends with the question: ""What is the name of the first Jewish century? Aaron's breastplate"" and the answer: ""The first century of the Jewish people, the twelve stones in the tetragrammaton, the tinea of the zodiac, and the zirconium of the crescent moon,"" and the word ""lentigine"" for a small pigmented spot on the skin. The answers are in the next section of Pradeep's book, ""Cricket in India,"" which is published by Penguin Books, priced £9.99 (with free UK p&p) and £16.95 (with Australian p&P).

In the eighth and ninth century, religious treaties associating a particular stone with an apostle were written. Practice became to keep twelve stones and wear one a month. Wearing a single birthstone is only a few centuries old, although modern authorities differ on dates Kunz places the custom in eighteenth century Poland, while the Gemological Institute of America starts it in Germany in the 1560s. In 1912, in an effort to standardize birthstones, the National Association of Jewelers (now called Jewelers of America) met in Kansas and officially adopted a list. The American Gem Trade Association added tanzanite as a December birthstone in 2002. The Jewelry Industry Council of America updated the list in 1952 by adding alexandrite to June and citrine to November; specifying pink tourmaline for October; replacing December's lapis with zircon; and switching the primary/alternative gems in March. There is a separate list of assignment according to the day of the week of the recipient's birth:  Sunday: topaz, diamond* Monday: pearl, crystal* Tuesday: ruby, emerald* Wednesday: amethyst, lodestone* Thursday: sapphire, carnelian* Friday: emerald, cat's eye* Saturday: turquoise, diamond. In 2016, the American Gem trade Association and Jewelers. of America added spinel as an additional birthstone for August. The Gregorian calendar has poems matching each month with its birthstone. Tiffany & Co. published these poems ""of unknown author"" for the first time in a pamphlet in 1870. A Hindu text from 1879, Mani Mala, lists gems for each month. The table below contains many stones which are popular choices, often reflecting Polish tradition. The Danish royals set the trend for future kings' names. The name of the current heirs in waiting give us any clues as to what the Cambridges might pick for their baby? With five girls and one boy lined up to take their country's thrones in a couple of generations time there are already plenty of ideas around for names judged appropriate for 21st century monarchs. It's a pretty exclusive club, being a future European monarch. Christian of Denmark is the only male heir among the primary school prince and princess club of Europe. The kings of Denmark have been called either Frederick or Christian since 1513. The current Crown Prince, Frederick, and his wife, Mary, had their first child in October 2005. The royal couple added to the suspense a little by following the Danish royal tradition of not announcing the name until the baby's christening. If future Queen Consort, Kate Middleton, has a boy then the European royal trend points to an ultra traditional name that's already been used by several kings. That could mean the bookies are spot on with their prediction of George for a little prince of Cambridge. The Great Architect of the Universe is a conception of God discussed by many Christian theologians and apologists. As a designation it is used within Freemasonry to represent deity neutrally (in whatever form, and by whatever name each member may individually believe in). It is also a Rosicrucian conception ofGod, as expressed by Max Heindel. The concept of the demiurge as a grand architect or a great architect also occurs in gnosticism and other religious and philosophical systems such as Christianity. The name of the character who plays Detective Inspector Richard Poole in the crime drama Death in Paradise, portrayed by Ben Miller, is a reference to the great architect of the universe. He was murdered in the first episode of Series 3, at a Cambridge university reunion, by Helen Reid, when he threatened to expose her identity theft, and was replaced by DI Humphrey Goodman. In series 2 he grew slightly more relaxed. He recommended Fidel for the sergeant's exam. Poole briefly returned to London, but in spite of his distaste for Saint Marie, he chose to return. He is an ""English eccentric with a hatred for island life"". He often showed a useful knack for making deductive leaps based on minimal information and random events, and favoured making arrests by addressing all the suspects at once before identifying the killer. He has a bit of Morse here, a dash of Columbo there, a pinch of Precious Ramotswe and a lug of Jonathan Creek. The Great Architect of the Universe has been employed many times in Christianity. An illustration of God as the architect of the universe can be found in a Bible from the Middle Ages. The Great Architect may also be a metaphor alluding to the godhead potentiality of every individual. In the Hermetic Tradition, each and every person has the potential to become God, this idea or concept of God is perceived as internal rather than external. We create our own reality; hence we are the architect. Another way would be to say that the mind is the builder. In Heindel's exposition, the Great Architect is the Supreme Being, who proceeds from The Absolute, at the dawn of manifestation. The Demiurge is the God of Old Testament, in opposition to Christ and Sophia, messengers of Gnosis of the True God. For a detailed discussion of the Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception, see The Rosicroucian cosmo-conception. The concept of a Great Architect occurs in gnosticism. James Hopwood Jeans, in his book The Mysterious Universe, also employs the concept of an Architect of The Universe at one point, saying: ""Lapsing back again into the crude anthropomorphic language that we have already used, we may say we may have already considered with disfavour the universe having been planned by a biologist or an engineer"" The concept has also been used in the Bible and in the works of St Thomas Aquinas, who said: ""God, Who is the first principle of all things, may be compared to things created as the Architect is to things designed (ut artifex ad artificiata).""   Commentators have pointed out that the assertion that the Grand Architect of. the Universe is the Christian God ""is not evident on the basis of 'natural theology' alone but requires an additional 'leap of faith' based on the revelation of the Bible"".  The term is also used in Freemasonry and the Swedish Rite, which has the prerequisite of professing to Christian Faith, uses the form ""The Threefold Great Architect"" or ""Architect of the. Universe"". The term has been used as a placeholder for a Supreme Being of one's choice in the Hermeticism. Great Architect of the Universe now begins to appear as a pure mathematician. Jinarajadasa adds that the Great Architect is also a Grand Geometrician. The concept of the Demiurge as a benevolent great architect or grand architect of matter occurs in the writings of Plato, including in the Timaeus. Martinists hold that whilst it is possible to ""invoque"" Him, it is not to adore Him. Calcium carbide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula of CaC2. Its main use industrially is in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide. The reaction of calcium carbide with water, producing acetylene. and calcium hydroxide, was discovered by Friedrich Wöhler in 1862. It was made possible in the USA as a result of massive amounts of inexpensive hydroelectric power produced at Niagara Falls before the turn of the 20th century. Today acetylene is mainly manufactured by the partial combustion of methane by the combustion of ethylene stream from cracking of hydrocarbons. Approximately 400,000 tonnes are produced per year in the United States. The common crystalline form at room temperature is a distorted rock-salt structure with the C22− units lying parallel. The material is colorless, however pieces of technical-grade calciumcarbide are grey or brown and consist of about 80–85% ofCaC2 (the rest is CaO), Ca3P2 (calcium phosphide), CaS (cal calcium sulfide) and SiC (silicon carbide), etc.). In the presence of trace moisture, technical- grade calcium carbIDE emits an unpleasant odor reminiscent of garlic. The product produced generally contains around 80% calcium carbides by weight. The carbide product produced is crushed to produce small lumps that can range from a few mm up to 50 mm. The impurities present in the carbide include phosphide, which produces phosphine when hydrolysed. The method for the production in an electric arc furnace was discovered in 1892 by T. L Willson and independently by H. Moissan in the same year. This method has not changed since its invention in 18 92. It is the basis of the industrial manufacture of acetene, and is the major industrial use of calcium. carbide. It can also be used to make acetylene in carbide lamps. Calcium carbide is used in the desulfurisation of iron (pig iron, cast iron and steel) It is also used in steelmaking to extend the scrap ratio to liquid iron. It is used as a powerful deoxidizer at ladle treatment facilities. In China, acetylene derived from calcium carbide remains a raw material for the chemical industry, in particular for the production of polyvinyl chloride. Water dripping on carbide produces acetylene gas, which burns and produces light. In the USA, Europe, and Japan, consumption of calciumcarbide is generally declining. In 2005 output was 8.94 million tons, with the capacity to produce 17 million tons. The chemical formula of calcium cyanamide is: CaC2 + N2 → CaCN2 + C. It can be found in the IUPAC chemical formula: C2H4. Calcium cyanamide can also be found as a fertilizer in the form of H2NCN. It has been used in toy cannons such as the Big-Bang Cannon, as well as in bamboo cannons. It's used in floating, self-igniting naval signal flares, such as those produced by the Holmes' Marine Life Protection Association. In some countries it is illegal in some countries because consumption of fruits artificially ripened using calcium carbides can cause serious health problems in those who partake them. It was used in carbide lamps in early automobiles, motorcycles and bicycles, but have been replaced entirely by electric lamps. Carbide lamps are also still used by some cavers exploring caves and other underground areas,  although they are increasingly being replaced in this use by LED lights. The city of Meissen (in German orthography: Meißen) is a town of approximately 30,000 about 25 km northwest of Dresden on both banks of the Elbe river in the Free State of Saxony, in eastern Germany. It grew out of the early Slavic settlement of Mis(s)ni, named for the small river(s), inhabited by the Glomacze tribe. The Catholic Diocese of Meisen was founded in 968, and became the episcopal see of Dresden in 1581 after the Protestant Reformation (5915), but re-created in 1921 with its first seat at Bautzen and now at the Katholische Hofkirche in Dresden. The town is sometimes known as the ""cradle ofSaxony"". It was founded by King Henry Fowler of the Slavic tribe and was a German town in 929. Meissen is a city in Saxony, Germany. It is famous for the manufacture of porcelain, based on local deposits of china clay (kaolin) and potter's clay (potter's earth) The Albrechtsburg, the former residence of the House of Wettin, is regarded as being the first castle to be used as a royal residence in the German-speaking world. The 13th-century Gothic Meissen Cathedral (Meißner Dom) is one of the most famous burial places of the WettIn family. Its tower hosts the world's first Porcelain carillon, manufactured in 1929 on the occasion of the town's 1000-years-jubilee. The city is part of the Saxonian wine region, one of northernmost in Europe. It was the capital of the Electorate of Saxony from 1423 to 1464, when the capital was moved to Dresden. During World War II, a subcamp of Flossenbürg concentration camp was located in Meissan. The town is known for its fine wine, produced at the vineyards in the river valley (Elbtal) around the town, which is home to the Weinfest, which celebrates the wine harvest. It also has a famous pottery market, which takes place from spring to autumn. The first European porcelaine was manufactured in MeISSen in 1710, when by decree of King Augustus II the Strong the Royal-Polnische and Electoral-Saxon Porzellan-Manufaktur was opened in the Triebisch river valley of Meisser. In 1759 the Austrians defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Meisensen. The Saxon town is located in the northernmost part of Saxon Germany, near the border with the state of Hesse. It has a population of around 50,000 people (as of 2011) with a population growth rate of around 2.5% per year. It lies on the River Elbe, which flows through the town to the north and south to the Ostsiedlung, or intensive German settlement of the rural Slavic lands east of the Elbe. The population of the city is about 40,000 (2011) with the majority of people living in or near the town of Dresden. The cathedral was built in 1260 on the same hill as the AlbreChtsburg castle. The church is also known as being one of. the purest examples of Gothic architecture. It contains many buildings of Renaissance architecture. ""Running Bear"" is a song written by J. P. Richardson (aka The Big Bopper) and sung most famously by Johnny Preston in 1959. It was No. 1 for three weeks in January 1960 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Billboard ranked "" running bear"" as the No. 4 song of 1960. The Guess Who included the song on their 1972 album Rockin', although the songwriting credit is incorrectly given to Clarence ""Curly"" Herdman, a country and bluegrass fiddler. The song was used in the 1994 movie A Simple Twist of Fate, which stars Steve Martin as Michael McCann, a fine furniture maker in rural Virginia, who adopts a little girl named Mathilda. In 1960, the Dutch group Het Cocktail Trio recorded a version of the song called Grote Beer ('Great Bear', but also 'Ursa Maior') about an Indian who travels in space. One of Sonny James' 16 consecutive No.1 singles was a cover version of ""Running Bear."" Released in April 1969, James topped the Hot Country Singles chart in mid-June and spent three weeks at no. 1. The Youngbloods released a single in 1972 and was featured on their album High on a Ridge Top. In 1975, Danny Davis and the Nashville Brass recorded a toe-tapping version for their 1975 album Dream Country, which reached #8 in the UK charts. It appears on many greatest compilations, including Time Changes, Everything Changes, and Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. The lyrics describe their fate: ""Now they'll always be together / In their happy hunting ground."" The song tells the story of Running Bear, a ""young Indian brave"", and Little White Dove, an ""Indian maid"". The two are in love but are separated by two factors: their respective tribes are at war. After sharing a passionate kiss, they are pulled down by the swift current and drown. The two, longing to be together, despite the obstacles and the risks posed by the river, dive into the raging river to unite. On which river is the German town of Meissen, famous for its porcelain? The answer is Elbe, in the town of Arita, Japan, since 1979. The answer to the question is: Vitry Sur Seine, France, since 1973. The song is a staple of Williams and Ree's live set and is one of the duo's most popular songs. A German version titled Brauner Bär und Weiße Taube (""Brown Bear and White Dove"") was recorded as a single by Gus Backus in 1960. The song was occasionally part of Led Zeppelin's live repertoire in the early 1970s, during rock medleys contained within long versions of ""Whole Lotta Love"" The Pearl Roundabout was destroyed on March 18, 2011 by government forces as part of a crackdown on protesters during the Bahraini uprising (2011–present) The roundabout served originally as a major traffic intersection for routes into the capital city, although it is now bypassed by a flyover and junction complex. The Pearl Monument previously stood in the center of the circle, having been erected in 1982 on the occasion of the third summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which was hosted by Bahrain for the first time in Manama on November 9–11 of that year. The Central Bank of Bahrain reportedly asked banks to exchange their half-dinar coins for half- dinar banknotes after the Pearl Monument was destroyed. The coin is no longer minted or distributed by the central bank of Bahrain. The roundabouts was the site of demonstrations during 2011, which began in February. It has been compared by the protesters to Cairo's Tahrir Square, the main site of the 2011 Egyptian revolution, and to the Bahrain World Trade Center and the Bahrain Financial Harbour. In 2012 Ray Stevens covered the song on his 9-CD box set, The Encyclopedia of Recorded Comedy Music, and later on his live album, Hanx!. The song has been covered by Stiff Little Fingers, who covered it on their album All the Best, as well as the band's live album Hanx! and on the re-issue of their live album,. The song is also featured on the soundtrack to the film, ""The Adventures of O.J. Simpson"", which was released in 1998. The film is based on the book, The Adventures Of O. J. Simpson, by John O'Brien and Stephen Leathers. The book was published by Simon & Schuster, and is available in hardback and paperback. Pearl Roundabout was the scene of political protests during 2011 in Bahrain. Police forces entered the location at 3:00 in an attempt to disperse protesters. The crackdown led to many injuries as well as the death of at least four civilians. The protesters' camp in the roundabout was evacuated, bulldozed, and set on fire by the Bahraini Defense Force, riot police, and Peninsula Shield Force. The government changed the name of the site to Al Farooq Junction, a reference to Umar ibn al-Khattab, a historical figure revered by Sunnis and considered by Shiites to be against their cause. The area has been sealed off by security forces since protesters were cleared from the Pearl Roundabout on 16 March 2011. Osmotherley is an English village and civil parish, situated in the Hambleton hills in North Yorkshire. The village is the western edge of the North York Moors National Park. It is on the route of the 110 mile Cleveland Way National Trail. The name is likely to mean the clearing or 'ley' (pronounced lee), belonging to a Viking called 'Asmund' or a Saxon called 'Osmund'. There have been a number spellings of the OsmOTHERley over the centuries: the name appeared in the Domesday Book as Asmundrelac; it has also been known as Osmundeslay and Osmonderlay. However, local legend says local legend say that it means 'clearing or clearing' or 'cleared' in the local dialect of the same name, which means 'to clear or clear' or to clear a field. The word 'O smotherley' is also used to refer to a village in Yorkshire, which was once known as 'O Smotherley', and to the village of Osmolderley in the North Yorkshire Moors, which is now part of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, which has its own version of the word'moors' The name of Al Faroq Junction was given to the junction and the military operation by Khalifa Bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, the head of security forces and a member of the royal family. Osmotherley was named after the mother of a villager named Oswald or Osmund, who supposedly went out to gather firewood in the winter. The village was featured on BBC News and Sky News during the Wedding of Prince William of Wales and Catherine Middleton, as it is the only village in the country to boast a pub with the name 'Queen Catherine' The village is served by a newsagents, a 'Top Shop' store, a fish and chip shop, a Youth Hostel and an antique store. The public toilets are situated by the side of the Village Hall (which in turn is next to Church House, which hosts book sales and tea sales on Sundays and Bank Holidays) The Tagus is the longest river on the Iberian Peninsula, and drains an area of 80100 sqkm (the second largest in the Douro peninsula after the largest in Portugal) It is 1038 km long, 716 km in Spain and 275 km in Portugal, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean. Several dams and diversions supply water for drinking and drinking water supply in the village. It is thought that George Fox may have visited the village in late 17th century, and John Wesley preached at the barter table in the middle of the village on several occasions, the first in 1745. In popular culture the village is the setting of some of the final chapters of the novel Brother in the Land by Robert Swindells. In the novel, many towns and cities in it are hit by individually programmed nuclear missiles, but Osmotherly's small size means it is spared. The official starting point is at the edge of the moors above the village, where there is a stone marker. About 1½ miles from the A19 is Mount Grace Priory. These beautiful ruins are situated at the foot of a steep wooded hill with a footpath leading up it into the village; this Carthusian religious house was founded around 1396. The shop that has served OsmOTHERley since 1786, 'Thompson', along with a recently opened Art and Craft Shop have recently closed. The walk ends at the western terminus of the Lyke Wake Walk, which runs for 42 miles from O smotherley to Ravenscar, near the village of Ravenscar in the Dorset coast. It has been voted the best village pub in the UK on several times. It gets its name from Cod Beck, a small tributary of the River Swale, meaning woody. Just before Cod Beck reaches the reservoir is a picturesque location called Sheepwash. The source of the Tagus is the Fuente de García, in the Frías de Albarracín municipal term. The main cities it passes through are Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera de la Reina and Alcántara in Spain, and Abrantes, Santarém, Almada and Lisbon in Portugal. Between dams it follows a very constricted course, but after Almourol it enters a vast alluvial valley prone to flooding. At its mouth is a large estuary on which the port city of Lisbon is situated. There is the largest bridge across the river, the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which with a total length of  is the longest bridge in Europe. The Portuguese Alentejo region and former Ribatejo Province take their names from the river. The river had strategic value to the Spanish and Portuguese empires, as it guarded the approach to Lisbon. In 1587, Sir Francis Drake briefly approached the river after his successful raid at Cadiz. Slippage along it has caused numerous earthquakes, the major ones being those of 1309, 1531 and 1755. A popular fado song in Lisbon notes that while people get older, the Tagos remains young. The author, Fernando Pessoa, wrote a poem that begins: ""The Tagu is more beautiful than the river that flows through my village. But the Tagu, or the Weeper"" refers to the ""Golden"" Tagus as wanting Mary Magdalene's silver tears. The Tagus was famous for its gold-bearing sands (Catullus 29.19, Ovid, Amores, 1.15.34, Juvenal, Satires, 3.55, etc.) in classical poetry. It is the source of most of central Spain, including Madrid, and Portugal, while dozens of hydroelectric stations create power. The Pepper Wreck, properly the wreck of the Nossa Senhora dos Mártires, is a shipwreck located and excavated at the mouth of theTagus between 1996 and 2001. It was found to be the largest shipwreck in Europe at the time, with a length of more than 1,000 miles. It has been named after the Portuguese town of Alentejos, which is located on the banks of the River Tagus. The city of Blondi (1941) is the capital of Portugal, and is on the river's banks. The River Tagu was a gift from Adolf Hitler to his German Shepherd, Blondsi, as a puppy from Martin Bannann. Blondi played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover. Dogs like Blondi were coveted as ""germanischer Urhund"", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Third Reich. Hitler's dog-handler, Feldwebel Fritz Tornow, shot them in the garden of the bunker complex on 30 April, after Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide. He also killed Eva Braun's two dogs, Frau Gerda Christian's dogs and his own dachshund. After the battle in Berlin ended, the remains of Hitler, Braun, and two dogs were discovered in a shell crater by a unit of SMERSH, the Soviet counter-intelligence agency. The dog thought to be Blonda was exhumed and photographed by the Soviets. Don't Go Breaking My Heart is a duet by Elton John and Kiki Dee. It was originally intended to record the song with Dusty Springfield, but Dusty withdrew because she was too ill at the time. It is not to be confused with the title of the song of the same name recorded by Hal David in 1965 for the album I Am Am I Am. The song is a pastiche of the Motown style, recorded by Marvin Gaye and various duets such as Tammi and Kim Weston. It has been recorded by various artists, notably various duet singers such as EltonJohn and DustySpringfield, and the song was released as a single in the 1970s and 1980s. The single was a No. 1 hit in the UK and No. 2 in the U.S. in the 1990s, with sales of more than $1.2 million. The German Shepherd was a popular breed in the 1930s and 1940s. Hitler had two German Shepherd dogs, a mother [born 1926] and daughter [born ca. 1930] – both named Blonda. In May 1942, Hitler bought another young German Shepherd ""from a minor official in the post office in Ingolstadt""  to keep Blonda company. He called her Bella. Hitler was distraught when he lost a stray white Fox Terrier named ""Fuchsl"" during World War I. He had been given a German Shepherd before named ""Prinz"" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed. ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" was the first No. 1 single in the UK for both John and Kiki Dee, topping the chart for six weeks in mid 1976. John would not enjoy a solo British chart-topper until ""Sacrifice"" in 1990. The song can be found on Elton John's Greatest Hits Volume II (1977) and Greatest Hits 1976–1986; the 1995 UK CD of Rock of the Westies includes it as a bonus track (the US edition did not, however). In 2002, it also appeared on John's 2-disc greatest hits album. A demo version of the song was recorded by John as a solo artist. This version has not been released commercially. In June 2013, 37 years after its original release, the single reached one million sales in the U.S. John and Taupin received the 1981 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically for ""Kiki Jinx"" in early 1994. It was never included on an original album (although it was recorded during the Blue Moves sessions), but was subsequently in released as the third single on the album Duets, in late 1994. John failed to have another #1 single, without sharing the top song with other credited artists, until his 1997 smash Candle In The Wind 1997. He performed the track with Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan) at the 2001 British Comedy awards. John appeared with Minnie Mouse on the NBC series Totally Minnie miming to the track. He also performed it with the Spice Girls on his ITV tribute programme An Audience with... Elon John. In 1987, John and Dee performed the. track to the crowd at Wembley Stadium during John's set at Live Aid (where Dee sang backup). In 1985, John appeared. with Dee on the track on The Muppet Show and performed thetrack with Miss Piggy. in 1985. John's improvising of past Sonny & Cher hits ""I Got You Babe"" and ""The Beat Goes On"" was supposedly inspired by Cher, as well as the solo Cher song ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"" during the fadeout of the video for ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me"" in 1986. The B-side, ""Snow Queen"", was supposed to be a duet with Cher, but John recorded it with George Michael credited as a co-producer. It has been recorded by many artists, but not by John. John has not released it commercially. Percy Lebaron Spencer (July 19, 1894 – September 8, 1969) was an American physicist and inventor. He became known as the inventor of the microwave oven. Spencer's father died, and his mother soon left him in the care of his aunt and uncle. His uncle then died when Spencer was just seven years old. Spencer subsequently left grammar school to earn money to support himself and his aunt. At the age of 18, Spencer decided to join the U.S. Navy. He had become interested in wireless communications after learning about the wireless operators aboard the Titanic when it sank. While working at Raytheon, Spencer developed a more efficient way to manufacture magnetrons, by punching out and soldering together parts, rather than using machined parts. Spencer was not the first to notice the candy bar he had melted in an active radar set, he had first noticed the first candy bar in his pocket when he had not been paying attention to it. He also taught himself trigonometry, calculus, chemistry, physics, and metallurgy, among other subjects. By 1939, Spencer became one of the world’s leading experts in radar tube design. For his work, he was awarded the Distinguished Public Service Award by the United States Public Service Service Association. He died in 1969 in a car accident in Maine. He is survived by his wife, two children, and a step-granddaughter. He was buried in a private ceremony in Maine on September 14, 1969. He has a son and a daughter, both of whom are now in their 80s and 90s, and two step-daughters, who are in their 60s and 70s, respectively. His great-great-grandson is also in his 90s and his great-grandchild is in his 70s and 80s, but he is still in his 80s. The song was written in 1908 and is called ""The Farmyard"" It is based on the nursery rhyme ""Old MacDonald Had A Farm"" It was written by MacDonald's son, George MacDonald, and was published in the book ""The Adventures of Old MacDonald"" (1908) The song has been adapted into several films and TV shows, including ""The Moo Moo"" and ""Mow the Moo,"" and has been made into a movie by the Walt Disney Company. It is available on iTunes and Amazon.com for about $20.00 (US) and $30 (UK) It is also available on YouTube for around $20 (US). Raytheon filed a patent on October 8, 1945 for a microwave cooking oven, eventually named the Radarange. He decided to experiment using food, including popcorn kernels, which became the world’s first microwaved popcorn. Spencer then created the first true microwave oven by attaching a high density electromagnetic field generator to an enclosed metal box. In 1967 the first relatively affordable ($495) and reasonably sized (counter-top) microwave oven was available for sale. He received 300 patents during his career, and a building at the Raytheon Missile Defense Center in Woburn, Massachusetts is named in his honor. He was married to Lillian Ottenheimer on November 18, 1960. He counted Vannevar Bush, Omar Bradley, William Redington Hewlett and David Packard as friends. He had three children: John, James, and George. He also had a son, George, who died in a plane crash in 1969. He died on November 17, 1973. He is buried in the family cemetery in Massachusetts. He has no formal education, but was awarded the Distinguished Public Service Award, Fellowship in the American Academy of Radio Engineers, and an honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Massachusetts, despite having no formalEducation. His wife, Louise, was a former member of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of England. His son George died on December 17, 1978. He and his wife had three kids: John,. James,and George. The son died on January 17, 1979. He suffered a heart attack on January 23, 1979, and died on February 1, 1979 at the age of 48. He never had any formal education. His children have been married and have a son and a daughter. His grandchildren have been born and have also been born. His great-grandchildren have been named John and James Spencer, and his great-great-grandchild is named John Spencer, who was born on December 25, 1981. He passed away on December 26, 1984. He lived in Massachusetts and died in Massachusetts on December 28, 1989. He left a wife and three children. His funeral was held on December 29, 1989, in Boston, Massachusetts. The funeral was attended by his wife and two children, John and Louise Spencer, as well as other family members. In 1932 the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd unified with the regions of Al-Hasa and Qatif to form Saudi Arabia.

The first two series were both massively popular and cultish at the same time, winning a BAFTA, a Royal Television Society Award and a Golden Rose at Montreux. The third series took a different turn with the characters all involved in a skein of stories which all interlinked into a larger narrative. The creators were getting frustrated with their characters and situations, and imprisoned within them - and this was made even plainer in the film version of the series. Most of the time TLOG is just extremely funny, biting and brilliantly, dramatically written - the classiest sketch-based format written in recent broadcasting history. Whether they do ano series or not, The League of Gentlemen will always have a special place in my heart for its dark, disturbing and wonderful characters and stories. It was the need to create truly original characters that drove the League in the first place, and you can't stuff that genie back in the bottle. The League is one of the most successful comedy formats of all time, and it will always be remembered as one of Britain's most successful sitcoms.

Newmarket Racecourse, which has a capacity of 45,000, is a British Thoroughbred horse racing venue in the town of Newmarket, Suffolk. The racecourse hosts two of the country's five Classic Races - the 1,000 Guineas and 2,000 guineas, and numerous other Group races. In total, it hosts 9 of British racing's 32 annual Group 1 races. Newmarket has two courses - the Rowley Mile Course and the July Course. Both are wide, galloping tracks used for Flat racing only. There is also a third course, the Round Course, but this is only used once a year for the Newmarket Town Plate, a race of great historical significance, but limited importance in modern day racing. About half of the racecourse complex, including the July and Cesarewitch/Beacon courses, is actually in the neighbouring county of Cambridgeshire. Whyte's History of the British Turf (1840), for instance, lists the 'Beacon' and 'Cesarewitch' courses as being in use at Newmarket. The Devil's Dyke is the edge of the course, and is used by light aircraft formerly by the Royal Air Force (RAF) as RAF New market. The July Course, also sometimes called the Summer Course, has a 1 mile (1600 m) straight, known as 'The Bunbury Mile'. After 2 furlongs (400 m), there is a long downhill stretch before the uphill furlong (200 m) to the finish. This course also uses the 'Cedarswitch' course for longer distances, again turning right-handed into the straight. The Rowleymile Course is used for racing in the Spring and Autumn, while the July course is used in Summer. It has a grass strip by the side of the track, which was used by the RAF as RAF RAF Newmarket in the 1950s and 1960s. It is also known as the 'Bunbury Mile' because of the number of horses that have raced on it. The track has been used for horse racing since the time of James I, who was known to attend races on Newmarket Heath with his brother, the future James II. At that time, formal races at New market only took place twice a year - once in April, once in October. By 1840, there were seven annual meetings: The Craven Meeting - a week, beginning Easter Monday (inaugurated 1771) The Town Plate - a four-year-old race over four miles, each carrying 8 stone 7 lbs. A screwdriver is a popular alcoholic highball drink made with orange juice and vodka. The most common one is made with one part vodka, one part any kind of orange soda, and one part of orange juice.

Betty drives too fast, so the movers's van which must follow has an accident. At their new home, also council owned, neighbor Lewis soon learns sharing a house with Frank means living in a live disaster area. Frank is basically the same, except for his vocabulary which seems to have expanded considerably since we last saw him. Frank even falls into a barrel of tar at one point, and emerges looking like something out of 'Quatermass 2' ( he chats briefly to an Indian man played by Babar Bhatti - of 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum' - but this scene is missing from the D.V.D. release). Frank goes up into the loft, and falls head-first into his neighbour's ceiling, clutching his cat. Frank turns the water back on, drenching neighbour Mr.Lewis ( Glynn Edwards ) who had been trying to unblock the sink. Frank has to bring the furniture down himself, as the removal men are too nervous to venture upstairs. The removal van has to keep up, causing Frank to be buffeted about like a rag doll. Most of their belongings wind up on the road. Frank makes a good impression, and makes the neighbour's cat very happy. Frank's best moment - at night time - is when he says to his new neighbour: ""Hello Jean Boht, I'm your new neighbour!"". He fails. to get a phone installed in his shed, and fails to get the door to open. Frank gets into a fight with a neighbour, and ends up with his head in the wall. Frank and Betty get into an argument, and Frank ends up in the hospital. Frank Spencer gets into another fight with the removal van, and the neighbor's cat gets into the house. Frank falls into the ceiling, and holds on for dear life. The house collapses, and it is revealed that Frank has been wrecking the house for years. The council sees no other hope for the house, as they have no choice but to move it. Frank, Betty and Lewis are forced to share a house, which is also council-owned. Frank tries to fix it himself, but fails. The neighbours are not impressed, and complain about the mess. Frank goes to the hospital, where he has to be taken away in a stretcher."

Jesus Heals Blind Bartimeus (Mark 10:46-52) - Analysis
Jesus Heals Blind Bartimeus (Mark 10:46-52) - Analysis
By Austin Cline
Updated September 11, 2016.
46 And they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging. 47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
48 And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. 49 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee. 50 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
51 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. 52 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
Compare: Matthew 20:29-34; Luke 18:35-43
Jesus, Son of David?
Jericho is on the way to Jerusalem for Jesus, but apparently nothing of interest happened while he was there. Upon leaving, however, Jesus encountered another blind man who had faith that he would be able to cure his blindness. This isnt the first time Jesus cured a blind man and its unlikely that this incident was meant to be read any more literally than previous ones.
I wonder why, at the beginning, people tried to stop the blind man from calling out to Jesus. Im sure that he must have had quite a reputation as a healer by this point  enough of one that the blind man himself was obviously well aware of who he was and what he might be able to do. If that is the case, then why would people try to stop him? Could it have anything to do with him being in Judea  is it possible that the people here are not happy about Jesus?
It should be noted that this is one of the few times so far that Jesus has been identified with Nazareth. In fact, the only other two times so far came during the first chapter. In verse nine we can read  Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee  and then later when Jesus is casting out unclean spirits in Capernaum , one of the spirits identifies him as thou Jesus of Nazareth. This blind man, then, is only the second to ever identify Jesus as such  and hes not exactly in good company.
This is also the first time that Jesus is identified as a son of David. It was foretold that the Messiah would come from the House of David, but so far Jesus lineage has not been mentioned at all (Mark is the gospel without any information about Jesus family and birth). It seems reasonable to conclude that Mark had to introduce that bit of information at some point and this is as good as any. The reference may also harken back to David returning to Jerusalem to claim his kingdom as described in 2 Samuel 19-20.
Isnt it odd that Jesus asks him what he wants? Even if Jesus werent God (and, therefore, omniscient ), but simply a miracle worker wandering around curing peoples ailments, it has to be obvious to him what a blind man rushing up to him might want. Isnt it rather demeaning to force the man to say it? Does he just want people in the crowd to hear what is said? Its worth noting here that while Luke agrees that there was a single blind man (Luke 18:35), Matthew recorded the presence of two blind men (Matthew 20:30).
I think its important to understand that it probably wasnt meant to be read literally in the first place. Making the blind see again appears to be a way of talking about getting Israel to see again in a spiritual sense. Jesus is coming to awaken Israel and cure them of their inability to properly see what God wants of them.
The blind mans faith in Jesus is what allowed him to be healed. Similarly, Israel will be healed so long as they have faith in Jesus and God. Unfortunately, it is also a consistent theme in Mark and the other gospels that the Jews lack faith in Jesus  and that lack of faith is what prevents them from understanding who Jesus really is and what he has come to do.

Luge
Luge is a  Winter Olympic sport. It uses a small one or two-person sled, on which the participants slide down the mountain face  up and feet first. Racing sleds weigh around twenty one to twenty five kilograms  for singles, and twenty five to thirty kilograms for doubles. The lugers can  read the speed of up to 140 kilometers per hour.
The term luge was first used in 1905. It’s from the French Savoy/Swiss  dialect which means small coasting sled. The governing body for Luge is the Federation Internationale de Luge de Course.  A team consisting of one or two can play. Both men and women can play but  usually in separate competitions.
Luge is held on either artificial tracks or  natural tracks. Natural tracks are on existing mountain roads and paths. The  participants equip themselves with a sled, helmet, suit, visor, gloves, finger  spikes, and booties. The four luge disciplines are: men’s singles, doubles or  mixed event, women’s singles, and team relay which is now an Olympic discipline.

Jackson Pollock Paintings
Jackson Pollock paintings are some of the most recognisable and thrilling images produced in the 20th century.  Pollock was  dubbed ‘Jack the Dripper’ by Time magazine due to the unusual way he liked to drip and splatter paint onto his  canvas.   Some of the inspiration for his paintings came from the Native American sand art he saw as a child  and his own method of working resembled a form of ritualised dance around the  canvas which was laid out flat on the floor.
One, No. 31
View at Art.com
Early Years
Jackson Pollock was born in  Cody, Wyoming in January 1912, the youngest of five brothers, and grew up in  Arizona and California.  He went to  school at the Manual Arts High School in California and at the age of 18, moved  to New York City to study under the American Regionalist painter, Thomas Hart  Benton, at the Art Students’ League.  The  main subject matter for his work during this period was the life in rural  America he had known as a boy.  During  the 1930s, Pollock was relatively unknown and struggled to survive during the  years of the Depression.   He succeeded  in getting a place on the Federal Art Project which gave him a small income and  enabled him to continue painting. 
Key Influences
Image From Art.com
In 1936 Pollock took part in  the Experimental Workshop run by the Mexican muralist, David Alfaro Siquieros  who encouraged the splattering, hurling and dripping of paint and who  introduced Pollock to the idea of ‘controlled accident’.  The dripping and pouring method of painting  adopted by Pollock in the 1940s also had roots in Surrealist automatism of that  time, a technique which enabled the unconscious mind to express itself  freely.  Pollock  also said of his work that it was ‘akin to  the method of the Indian sand painters of the West’ , a reference to the  American Indian custom of making sand paintings on the floor as part of a  religious ritual.  Pollock borrowed ideas  from all three sources to develop his own radical style of painting.
Moving Forward
In 1942, Pollock had a  breakthrough when he exhibited a painting at the McMillen Gallery in New York  alongside artists such as Picasso, Bonnard and Braque and the young American  artist, Lee Krasner .  Krasner introduced  Pollock to a wider art scene which then led to an introduction to Peggy  Guggenheim who had just opened the Art of This Century Gallery.  She liked his work and offered him a  contract.
Untitled, Jackson Pollock
Image From Art.com
In 1945, Pollock married Lee Krasner and they  moved to a farmhouse on Long Island where he continued to develop his radical  style of painting.  In 1947 he discarded  the paint brush and began the process of dripping and pouring the paint from  the can or from a stick directly onto a canvas spread on the floor.  These Jackson Pollock paintings, he said, had ‘no  beginning and no end’.  Films made in the  early 1950s show Pollock engaged in a ritualised dance around the canvas. 
Celebrity Artist
Jackson Pollock  paintings executed by the ""drip"" method established  his reputation.  By the late 1940s,  Pollock was a major celebrity and was featured in Time and Life magazines.  Time magazine dubbed him ‘Jack the Dripper’ and Life  magazine, albeit  somewhat cynically, ran the headline ‘Is this the greatest living painter in  the United States?’  This exposure turned  Pollock into a household  name and, for  the general public, he symbolised what was incomprehensible yet hugely exciting  about modern art.

Final Years
Pollock abandoned his drip  style in 1951 and began to paint more figuratively again but his painting  output started to decline and then ceased altogether.  He held his last one-man show in 1954.
He was a hard-drinker all his  life and had a tendency to live recklessly.  He began an affair in 1956 which led to  separation from his wife.  On 10 August  1956, he was killed instantly when the car he was driving crashed on the road  near his home.  Another passenger in the  car also died but his girlfriend survived.
Breaking The Ice
Willem de Kooning said of  Pollock, ‘he broke the ice’, meaning that he was part of something  that brought about the recognition of  Abstract Expressionist artists and created  a market for their work.  Shortly after Pollock’s death, his painting, Autumn Rhythm was sold to the  Metropolitan Museum for $30,000.  This  was unprecedented for an abstract work and had a knock-on effect on the prices  dealers could command for the work of the other Abstract Expressionists.  As Pollock’s dealer Sidney Janis recalled  later, ‘we had a little less trouble selling a de Kooning for $10,000 than we  had a month earlier trying to sell one for $5,000.’
In late 1956, The Museum of  Modern Art held a memorial retrospective of Pollock’s work comprising  thirty-five Jackson Pollock paintings and nine watercolours and drawings from  1938-1956.

Ganache
Ganache (; from the French word for ""jowl"")  is a glaze, icing, sauce, or filling for pastries  made from chocolate and cream. 
Ganache is normally made by heating cream, then pouring it over chopped chocolate of any kind. The mixture is stirred or blended until smooth, with liqueurs or extracts added if desired. Butter is traditionally added to give the ganache a shiny appearance and smooth texture.

Depending on the kind of chocolate used, for what purpose the ganache is intended, and the temperature at which it will be served, the ratio of chocolate to cream is varied to obtain the desired consistency. Typically, two parts chocolate to one part cream are used for filling cakes or as a base for making chocolate truffles, while one to one is commonly used as a glaze. Cooled ganache can be whipped to increase volume and spread to cover a cake. However, if left to cool too much it can become too thick and unspreadable. Another common use of ganache is to be poured into a mold or terrine while warm and allowed to set or cool. Once it has cooled it can be removed from the mold and sliced similarly to pâté.

Passage:
Thwaite (placename element)
Thwaite is a common element of placenames in North West England, and Yorkshire.  It is also found elsewhere in England, including two places called Thwaite in Norfolk and one in Suffolk.   It is most often found as a suffix.  It is a common element of field names, as well as settlement names.  

The name is usually from Old Norse thveit (also written þveit), but sometimes from Old Danish thwēt, both meaning ""clearing"" or ""meadow"".  Nevertheless, in England the name does not necessarily indicate a place of Scandinavian or Norman foundation, because it is often found in combination with Middle English or Old German personal names. 

The element is also found in Normandy.  In the Eure department alone there are at least five placenames with the same thveit root and meaning ""clearing in a wooded area"", locally represented as Thuit: Le Thuit; Thuit-Hébert; Le Thuit-Simer; Le Thuit-Signol; Le Thuit-Anger. In total there is no fewer than 89 placenames in Normandy with 'Tuit' in them. 

In Orkney and Shetland the element appears as Twatt. In Norway, the element appears as Tveit (Nynorsk) or Tvedt (Dano-Norwegian).
Question:
In place names what is the original meaning of `thwaite' as in Satterthwaite?
Answer:
CLEARING or MEADOW
Passage:
Derek Randall
Derek William Randall (born 24 February 1951, Retford, Nottinghamshire, England) is an English former cricketer, who played first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire, and Tests and ODIs for England in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Known to cricketing colleagues and cricket fans as ""Arkle"" after the racehorse, but always ""Rags"" to himself,  he was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1980. The cricket writer Colin Bateman said, ""The Retford imp was, and still is, one of the most fondly admired figures in the game... the rolling gait and big sad eyes make him Chaplinesque – and like all clowns, there is pathos behind the public image... At times, genius sat on Randall's shoulders – the only trouble was it would not stop fidgeting"". Randall played 47 Tests and 49 One Day International matches for England as a right-handed batsman before retiring to become a coach and cricket writer.

First-class career

Randall first came to note as a cover fielder, as one-day cricket forced fielding standards to improve. His run out of Gordon Greenidge in the 1979 Cricket World Cup final highlighted this, and his partnership with David Gower was a feature of the successful England team of the immediate post-Packer era. Known for his eccentric movement at the crease, Randall was a determined batsman, specialising in hooks, pulls, cuts and cover drives, the former being used most memorably against Dennis Lillee in the Centenary Test in Melbourne in 1977 when he made 174, the highest Test score by any Nottinghamshire batsman in the history of Test cricket.

After learning his cricket at Retford Cricket Club, Randall made his Nottinghamshire second XI debut in 1969, and his first-class debut against Essex at the end of May 1972, scoring 78 from number eight in the batting order with the next highest score being Garry Sobers' 32.  He won plaudits for his talent in the covers, won his Nottinghamshire cap in 1973 and went on to score 28,456 runs in all first-class cricket. Randall batted for the successful Nottinghamshire team of the early 1980s, winning the County Championship. 

With his team needing eighteen to win from the final over of the 1985 NatWest Trophy final, he hit sixteen from the first five balls, only to be caught in the outfield from the final delivery. 

He compiled fifty-two hundreds in all, and made 209 and 146 in the same game against Middlesex in 1979, a feat unequalled at Trent Bridge. He scored 1,000 runs in a season eight times, took 361 catches and 13 wickets at 31.00. His first-class bowling strike rate of 37 balls per wicket, compared well to Richard Hadlee's 45. He was popular with the crowds, who found his enthusiastic fielding and comic antics entertaining. He was famous for running, rather than walking, towards the batsman in the covers as the bowler delivered the ball and was responsible for many run-outs.

He retired from first-class cricket in 1993, but later turned out in Minor Counties cricket for Suffolk, playing in the NatWest Trophy at the age of 49, and in a match for ""Old Suffolk"" in 2004.

International career

During the Centenary Test, Randall scored 174 at Melbourne, against an Australian attack led by Dennis Lillee.  He famously doffed his cap to Lillee, after narrowly evading a savage bouncer, stating, ""No point in hitting me there, mate, there's nothing in it.""  When finally dismissed he left the ground by the wrong gate, and found himself climbing up towards the Royal enclosure where Queen Elizabeth II was watching the day's play. ""She was very nice about it,"" he told the BBC. ""She smiled. Someone else quickly put me right.""

He took the catch which clinched the Ashes in 1977 at Headingley, turning a cartwheel in celebration. Randall performed well against Australia, with the next tour in 1978/79 bringing a 5–1 Ashes win and two man of the match performances for Randall.  His innings of 150 in a series dominated by fast bowlers being the highlight. Randall scored centuries against New Zealand and India, and one from the position of opener against Pakistan, but he struggled against the West Indian attack of 1984, when he was asked to bat at number three in the first Test match of the summer, never to return. 

Randall was often the selectors' scapegoat for England's failings, and his Test batting positions ranged from number one to seven. Bateman commented about Randall, ""he was always available, always loyal, and his Test average in no way flattered him"". He played in more Tests than his Nottinghamshire alumni, such as Reg Simpson, Harold Larwood, Bill Voce, Joe Hardstaff senior, Joe Hardstaff junior and Arthur Shrewsbury.

Test centuries

* 174 v Australia at Melbourne (1977)
* 150 v Australia at Sydney (1979)
* 126 v India at Lord's (1982)
* 105 v Pakistan at Edgbaston (1982)
* 115 v Australia at Perth (1982)
* 164 v New Zealand at Wellington (1984)
* 104 v New Zealand at Auckland (1984)

Retirement

After retirement from first-class cricket, Randall coached numerous school and university sides, among many other projects. He coached Cambridge University and Bedford School; when Alastair Cook came through the School's First XI, Randall recommended that the youngster be picked for the ECB National Academy. He also coached Bedfordshire in the Minor County Championship. The 'Derek Randall Suite' at Trent Bridge is named in his honour. Randall  played for Matlock Cricket Club until 2010.

His books include The Young Player's Guide to Cricket and his autobiography, The Sun Has Got His Hat On.

Passage:
Senet
Senet (or Senat ) is a board game from predynastic and ancient Egypt. The oldest hieroglyph representing a Senet game dates to around 3100 BC.  The full name of the game in Egyptian was zn.t n.t ḥˁb meaning the ""game of passing"".

History

Senet is one of the oldest known board games. It has been found in predynastic and First Dynasty burials of Egypt, c. 3500 BC and 3100 BC respectively. Senet is also featured in a painting from the tomb of Merknera (3300–2700 BC).  Another painting of this ancient game is from the Third Dynasty tomb of Hesy (c. 2686–2613 BC). It is also depicted in a painting in the tomb of Rashepes (c. 2500 BC). 

By the time of the New Kingdom in Egypt (1550–1077 BC), it had become a kind of talisman for the journey of the dead. Because of the element of luck in the game and the Egyptian belief in determinism, it was believed that a successful player was under the protection of the major gods of the national pantheon: the sun deity Ra, the wisdom deity Thoth, and sometimes the afterlife deity Osiris. Consequently, Senet boards were often placed in the grave alongside other useful objects for the dangerous journey through the afterlife, and the game is referred to in Chapter XVII of the Book of the Dead. 

Gameplay

The Senet gameboard is a grid of 30 squares, arranged in three rows of ten. A Senet board has two sets of pawns (at least five of each or, in some sets, more, as well as shorter games with fewer). Although details of the original game rules are a subject of some conjecture, Senet historians Timothy Kendall and R. C. Bell, respectively, have made their own reconstructions of the game.  Their rules have been adopted by sellers of modern Senet sets.

Senet is a grid game for two players and is thought to be the oldest board game in the world. In which country did it originate?

Passage:
Charlie the Tuna
Charlie the Tuna is the cartoon mascot and spokes-tuna for the StarKist brand. He was created by Tom Rogers  of the Leo Burnett Agency after StarKist hired Leo Burnett in 1961. StarKist Tuna is the name of a brand of tuna currently owned by Dongwon Industries, a South Korea-based conglomerate.  StarKist itself is based in Pittsburgh, the home of its former parent company, H. J. Heinz Company, sharing its headquarters on the site of Three Rivers Stadium with another former parent company, Del Monte Foods' Pittsburgh headquarters.

History

Creation

As reported in news stories about Rogers, Charlie the Tuna was based on Rogers' friend, the actor-songwriter Henry Nemo.  B-movie actress Maila Nurmi claims that the character was originally sketched six years earlier by the actor James Dean while she was sitting with him one night in Googie's coffee shop in Los Angeles. However, StarKist and Burnett both give full credit to Rogers,  and there is no actual evidence for Nurmi's claim. 

Campaign

The advertisements depicted Charlie (voiced by actor Herschel Bernardi) as a hipster wearing a Greek fisherman's hat and coke-bottle glasses, whose goal is to be caught by the StarKist company. Charlie believes that he is so hip and cultured that he has ""good taste,"" and he is thus the perfect tuna for StarKist. Charlie is always rejected in the form of a note attached to a fish hook that says, ""Sorry, Charlie.""  The reason given by the narrator (voiced by Danny Dark) for the rejection was that StarKist was not looking for tuna with good taste but rather for tuna that tasted good. Some of the commercials ended with Charlie appeasing the viewers:  ""Tell 'em, Charlie sent you"". These commercials were animated by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises. 

""Sorry, Charlie"" became closely associated with StarKist and was also a popular American catchphrase. Charlie appeared in more than 85 advertisements for StarKist until the 1980s, when the campaign was retired. Charlie made a comeback in 1999, when StarKist revived him to introduce their new line of healthier tuna products.  He has been the mascot of the company since then.

Bernardi, the original voice of the character, died on May 9, 1986.   Dark died on June 13, 2004.  Rogers died on June 24, 2005. 

Legacy

Los Angeles radio personality and voiceover artist Charlie Tuna (real name: Art Ferguson) chose his on-air name early in his career upon the departure of another Oklahoma City disc jockey.  All disc jockeys at KOMA were told to draw their on-air names out of a hat, and by the time Chuck Riley picked his on-air name out of a hat, every name had been drawn except for ""Charlie Tuna.""  Riley used the name for a week, and then left.  His replacement, Art Ferguson, inherited the name, and he would keep the Charlie Tuna name upon relocating first to Boston and then Los Angeles.

American football head coach Bill Parcells earned the nickname ""The Big Tuna"" when he responded to an obviously false statement from a player with the incredulous ""Who do you think I am? Charlie the Tuna?""

American hip-hop star Chali 2na chose his rap name by slightly modifying the name Charlie Tuna, a nickname his uncle gave him in his youth.
Question:
What tuna brand uses a cartoon mascot known as Charlie the Tuna to advertise their product?
Answer:
StarKist Tuna
Passage:
Ossuary
An ossuary is a chest, box, building, well, or site made to serve as the final resting place of human skeletal remains. They are frequently used where burial space is scarce. A body is first buried in a temporary grave, then after some years the skeletal remains are removed and placed in an ossuary. The greatly reduced space taken up by an ossuary means that it is possible to store the remains of many more people in a single tomb than if the original coffins were left as is.

Persian 

In Persia, the Zoroastrians used a deep well for this function from the earliest times (c. 3,000 years ago) and called it astudan (literally, ""the place for the bones""). There are many rituals and regulations in the Zoroastrian faith concerning the astudans.

Roman Catholic 

Many examples of ossuaries are found within Europe, including the Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini in Rome, Italy; in south Italy the Martyrs of Otranto; the Fontanelle cemetery and Purgatorio ad Arco, Naples and many others; the San Bernardino alle Ossa in Milan, Italy; the Sedlec Ossuary in the Czech Republic; the Skull Chapel in Czermna in Lower Silesia, Poland; and Capela dos Ossos (""Chapel of Bones"") in Évora, Portugal. The village of Wamba in the province of Valladolid, Spain, has an impressive ossuary of over a thousand skulls inside the local church, dating from between the 12th and 18th centuries. A more recent example is the Douaumont ossuary in France, which contains the remains of more than 130,000 French and German soldiers that fell at the Battle of Verdun during World War I. The Catacombs of Paris represents another famous ossuary.

The catacombs beneath the Monastery of San Francisco in Lima, Peru, also contains an ossuary.

Eastern Orthodox

The use of ossuaries is a longstanding tradition in the Orthodox Church. The remains of an Orthodox Christian are treated with special reverence, in conformity with the biblical teaching that the body of a believer is a ""temple of the Holy Spirit"" (, etc.), having been sanctified and transfigured by Baptism, Holy Communion and the participation in the mystical life of the Church.  In Orthodox monasteries, when one of the brethren dies, his remains are buried (for details, see Christian burial) for one to three years, and then disinterred, cleaned and gathered into the monastery's charnel house. If there is reason to believe that the departed is a saint, the remains may be placed in a reliquary; otherwise the bones are usually mingled together (skulls together in one place, long bones in another, etc.). The remains of an abbot may be placed in a separate ossuary made out of wood or metal.

The use of ossuaries is also found among the laity in the Greek Orthodox Church. The departed will be buried for one to three years and then, often on the anniversary of death, the family will gather with the parish priest and celebrate a parastas (memorial service), after which the remains are disinterred, washed with wine, perfumed, and placed in a small ossuary of wood or metal, inscribed with the name of the departed, and placed in a room, often in or near the church, which is dedicated to this purpose.

Jewish

During the time of the Second Temple, Jewish burial customs included primary burials in burial caves, followed by secondary burials in ossuaries placed in smaller niches of the burial caves. Some of the limestone ossuaries that have been discovered, particularly around the Jerusalem area, include intricate geometrical patterns and inscriptions identifying the deceased. Among the best-known Jewish ossuaries of this period are: an ossuary inscribed 'Simon the Temple builder' in the collection of the Israel Museum, another inscribed 'Elisheba wife of Tarfon', one inscribed 'Yehohanan ben Hagkol' that contained an iron nail in a heel bone suggesting crucifixion, another inscribed 'James son of Joseph, brother of Jesus', the authenticity of which is opposed by some and strongly supported by others, and ten ossuaries recovered from the Talpiot Tomb in 1980, several of which are reported to have names from the New Testament.

During the Second Temple period, Jewish sages debated whether the occasion of the gathering of a parent's bones for a secondary burial was a day of sorrow or rejoicing; it was resolved that it was a day of fasting in the morning and feasting in the afternoon. The custom of secondary burial in ossuaries did not persist among Jews past the Second Temple period nor appear to exist among Jews outside the land of Israel.

Almost Like Being in Love
""Almost Like Being in Love"" is a popular song published in 1947. The music was written by Frederick Loewe, and the lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner.

The song was made popular by David Brooks and Marion Bell in the 1947 musical Brigadoon. It was later performed in the 1954 film version by Gene Kelly.

There were three hit versions of the song in the United States in 1947.  Frank Sinatra's version was the highest charting at #20.  Mildred Bailey and Mary Martin both charted with the song at #21 that year.

Nat King Cole recorded more than one version of the song, including a later version that was used as the closing song in the 1993 movie Groundhog Day which starred Bill Murray. Cole's version, in the key of G major like the original, features a ii–V–I turnaround (2-5-1) in G, a pair of similar 2-5-1 sequences in E major and D major for the bridge, after which it raises the refrain a half-step with a 2-5-1 in A flat major.

The song was revived in a downbeat ballad version by singer Michael Johnson (#32, 1978). It was also made popular by British singing sensation Dame Shirley Bassey. Like Judy Garland, Ms. Bassey performs this song as a medley with the song, This Can't Be Love.

Cover versions

Other musicians who have recorded ""Almost Like Being in Love"" include:

* Lester Young – Lester Young with the Oscar Peterson Trio (1952)
* Sonny Rollins and the Modern Jazz Quartet – Sonny Rollins with the Modern Jazz Quartet (1953)
* Nat King Cole – Sings For Two In Love (1955)

Passage:
Western roll
The Western roll  is a high jump technique invented by George  Horine of Stanford University.

History of the Western roll

It is said that George Horine came to invent the Western roll because the high jump pit at Stanford could be approached from only one side.  Another, perhaps more plausible, explanation is that the style was invented by the Stanford coach Edward Moulton.  However, neither of these stories occurs in a detailed contemporary profile of Horine, which states that Horine arrived at the style himself after many months of experimentation.  The style was controversial at first, partly because of rivalry between the US East and West Coasts (hence the label ""Western"" given to Horine's style). The initial  objections, due to the ""no diving"" rule then in force, were overcome by the development of a Western roll style in which the lead foot precedes the head in crossing the bar. Another Western athlete, Alma Richards of Utah, won the 1912 Olympic high jump using a Western roll with a more frontal, feet-first, approach. 

While the ""no diving"" rule was still in force, the world high jump record was captured by a series of Western roll jumpers: George Horine (1912, 6 ft), Edward Beeson (1914), Harold Osborn (1924), Walter Marty (1933), and Cornelius Johnson (1936). Johnson's record, (6 ft), was equaled on the same day by Dave Albritton, the first world record holder to use what we now call the straddle technique. At first, the straddle was viewed as just a variation of the Western roll,  and indeed video of the 1936 Olympics shows Albritton using a conventional Western roll at lower heights. The straddle did not come to dominate the high jump until the mid-1950s, by which time it was recognized as a separate style. Walt Davis was the last Western roll jumper to hold the world record, jumping 6 ft in 1953.

Only when Charles Dumas used the straddle technique to make the first 7 ft jump, in 1956, did the Western roll begin to disappear.

Impact on high jump rules

The Western roll was the catalyst for two changes in the rules of high jumping. 

The first was in high jump equipment. Until the 1930s, the high jump bar rested on two pegs that projected from the back of the uprights. Consequently, the jumper could hit the bar quite hard without dislodging it, by pressing it back against the uprights. This was scarcely possible for scissors jumpers, but easily possible with the Western roll. This loophole was exploited by Harold Osborn, among
others.  As a result, high jump equipment was changed to ensure that the bar could be dislodged both backwards and forwards. 

The other change was in the ""no diving"" rule, which was repealed shortly after the world record jumps of Johnson and Albritton, thus allowing the head to cross the bar before the feet. This led to a ""dive"" version of the western roll, which was used by the next world record holder, Melvin Walker in 1937,  and also by Walt Davis.

Description of the Western roll technique

The crucial difference between the Western roll and the various scissors styles that preceded it is in the direction of approach — from the opposite side, so that the takeoff leg is the one nearer to the bar. The lead leg is usually kicked up vigorously, lifting the body into a layout on the side or back above the bar, with the trailing leg folded beneath the lead leg. After the bar has been crossed, the body rotates to face the ground, and the trail leg drops to enable a three-point landing on it and the hands. Thus the Western roll is actually a glorified ""hop"" over the bar, and indeed the style is easily learned by starting with a hop and gradually strengthening the lead leg kick until the body is pulled into a layout above the bar.

The Western roll was a competitive high jump style for a long time because it was easy to learn and more efficient (allowing clearance of a bar that is closer to the height of the center of mass) than 
all but the most contorted variants of the scissors. It also enabled a comfortable landing in the crude sand pits provided for high jumpers up until the 1950s. However, the technique is less efficient than the straddle technique, a style that evolved from the Western roll when the rotation of the body was increased to the point where the bar was crossed face down.

These 10 animal facts will amaze you
In French, a brochette is a skewer, and foods cooked on a skewer are said to be en brochette. The word has been adopted into the English language, and English speakers usually interpret “brochette” to refer to food which has been cooked on a skewer, typically in a French style. In some parts of the American south, especially Louisiana, many types of brochettes are available, an enduring testimony to the French cultural influence in these areas. Brochette is available in some French restaurants as well, and it can also be made at home.
Many cuisines around the world have some version of the brochette. In Greece, it is known as souvlaki, while Thais call it satay and many Middle Easterners know it as kabob. As a general rule, people use specific ethnic terms to refer to foods from that nation, and “brochette” is usually used to discuss French food. However, a great deal of fusion between cuisines has occurred, leading to French style brochette served with Thai peanut sauce , for example.
The core of any brochette is, of course, the skewer. Foods are pierced with the skewer for cooking, whether they are grilled, baked, sauteed, roasted, or broiled. Diners can eat food directly off the skewer, sometimes using the skewer as a handle to dip the food in sauce, or they can tease the food off with an eating utensil for more tidy consumption. Typically, foods are coated in a marinade or rub before they are cooked.
Meats such as lamb, chicken, game, and seafood are common offerings in brochettes. Vegetables and fruits can also be used, and many cooks mix the two for flavor variation. Brochette may be served on its own, sometimes with a dipping sauce, or it may be part of a larger plate, as is the case with brochette served over rice or pasta. It is a common inclusion at buffet spreads, since brochettes can be easily picked up and handled by guests.
Making a brochette at home is quite easy. You'll need skewers and whatever ingredients you would like to cook on them, along with a marinade. For a very basic marinade, try mixing olive oil, vinegar , Worcestershire sauce, garlic , finely chopped onions, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Cut the food into evenly sized chunks, and marinate it for at least half an hour before putting it on the skewers. Cook the skewers using your method of choice, and serve warm with slices of lemon.

The Thomson's gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii) looks similar to Grant's Gazelle, but is noticeably smaller and has a white patch on its rump that extends beyond its tail onto its back. The animal can reach speeds of 50 mph (80 kph) and roams about the open, grassy plains of Africa.
Credit: Svetlana Starostina | Dreamstime
Gazelles are thin, graceful antelopes that live in Africa and Asia. They resemble deer and are in the same family as goats, cattle and sheep. Gazelles can be identified by their curved, ringed horns, tan or reddish-brown coats and white rumps. Often, there are spots or stripes on their coats. Their light frames help make them agile and better able to escape from predators.
There are 19 species of gazelle, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS). Smaller species, such as the Speke's gazelle and Thomson's gazelle, are only 20 to 43 inches (51 to 109 centimeters) at the shoulder. They weigh from 26 to 165 pounds (12 to 75 kilograms). The dama gazelle is the largest gazelle. It weighs in at 88 to 165 pounds (40 to 75 kg) and is 4.5 to 5.5 feet tall (137 to 168 cm).
Habitat
Most gazelles live in the hot, dry savannas and deserts of Africa and Asia. To stay hydrated in these grueling environments, gazelles shrink their heart and liver , according to a study published in the journal Physiological and Biochemical Zoology. Breathing can cause an animal to lose a lot of water. A smaller heart and liver need less oxygen, so the animal can breathe less and lose less water.
The Edmi gazelle, also known as the Cuvier's gazelle,is the only gazelle that lives in the mountains. It migrates during the wintertime to warmer regions.
Habits 
Gazelles rely on their speed to escape from predators. Gazelles can reach speeds up to 60 mph in short bursts and sustain speeds of 30 to 40 mph. When running, gazelles use a bounding leap, called ""pronking"" or ""stotting,"" which involves stiffly springing into the air with all four feet. 
These animals are highly social. Some gazelle herds have as many as 700 members, though some herds are small and segregated by gender. Female Thomson's gazelles, for example, live in herds of 10 to 30 females in addition to their young. Males live alone or in small groups with other males. A male herd is called a bachelor's herd. The segregation of herds is more prominent during mating season.

Passage:
Bifocals
Bifocals are eyeglasses with two distinct optical powers. Bifocals are commonly prescribed to people with presbyopia who also require a correction for myopia, hyperopia, and/or astigmatism.

History

Benjamin Franklin is generally credited with the invention of bifocals. Historians have produced some evidence to suggest that others may have come before him in the invention; however, a correspondence between George Whatley and John Fenno, editor of The Gazette of the United States, suggested that Franklin had indeed invented bifocals, and perhaps 50 years earlier than had been originally thought. 
Since many inventions are developed independently by more than one person, it is possible that the invention of bifocals may have been such a case. Nonetheless, Benjamin Franklin was among the first to wear bifocal lenses, and Franklin's letters of correspondence suggest that he invented them independently, regardless of whether he was the first to invent them.

John Isaac Hawkins, the inventor of trifocal lenses, coined the term bifocals in 1824 and credited Dr. Franklin.

In 1955, Irving Rips of Younger Optics created the first seamless or ""invisible"" bifocal, a precursor to all progressive lenses. 

Construction

Original bifocals were designed with the most convex lenses (for close viewing) in the lower half of the frame and the least convex lenses on the upper. Up until the beginning of the 20th century two separate lenses were cut in half and combined together in the rim of the frame. The mounting of two half lenses into a single frame led to a number of early complications and rendered such spectacles quite fragile. A method for fusing the sections of the lenses together was developed by Louis de Wecker at the end of the 19th century and patented by Dr. John L. Borsch, Jr. in 1908.
Today most bifocals are created by molding a reading segment into a primary lens and are available with the reading segments in a variety of shapes and sizes.The most popular is the D-segment, 28 mm wide[citation needed]. While the D-segment bifocal offers superior optics, an increasing number of people opt for progressive bifocal lenses.

Problems

Bifocals can cause headaches and even dizziness in some users. Acclimation to the small field of view offered by the reading segment of bifocals can take some time, as the user learns to move either the head or the reading material rather than the eyes.  Computer monitors are generally placed directly in front of users and can lead to muscle fatigue due to the unusual straight and constant movement of the head. This trouble is mitigated by the use of trifocal lenses or by the use of monofocal lenses for computer users.

In an interesting legal case reported in the UK in 1969, plaintiff's ability to use bifocals was impaired by accident. 

Future

Research continues in an attempt to eliminate the limited field of vision in current bifocals.  New materials and technologies may provide a method which can selectively adjust the optical power of a lens.  Researchers have constructed such a lens using a liquid crystal layer sandwiched between two glass substrates.

Bifocals in the animal world

The aquatic larval stage of the diving beetle Thermonectus marmoratus has, in its principal eyes, two retinas and two distinct focal planes that are substantially separated (in the manner of bifocals) to switch their vision from up-close to distance, for easy and efficient capture of their prey, mostly mosquito larvae. This is the first ever recorded use of bifocal technology in the animal world.

Who is credited with the invention of bi-focal glasses?

A Tradesman of Philidelphia

Austral Islands
The Tuha'a Pae, or Austral Islands (), are the southernmost group of islands in French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of France in the South Pacific. Geographically, they consist of two separate archipelagos, namely in the northwest the Tupua'i islands () consisting of the Îles Maria, Rimatara, Rūrutu, Tupua'i Island proper and Ra'ivāvae, and in the southeast the Bass Islands () composed of the main island of Rapa Iti and the small Marotiri (also known as Bass Rocks or Îlots de Bass). Inhabitants of the islands are known for their pandanus fiber weaving skills.  The islands of Maria and Marotiri are not suitable for sustained habitation. Several of the islands have uninhabited islets or rocks off their coastlines. Austral Islands' population is about 6,300 on almost 150 km2. The capital of the Austral Islands administrative subdivision is Tupua'i.

Geography

The Tuha'a Pae or Austral Islands () are the southernmost group of islands in French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of France in the South Pacific. Geographically, the Austral Islands consist of two separate archipelagos. From northwest to southeast they are:
* The Tupua'i Islands (), named for one of the main islands. It consists of:
** Îles Maria () in the northwest, part of Rimatara municipality
** Rimatara (),
** Rūrutu (),
** Tupua'i (),
** Ra'ivāvae (),
* The Bass Islands () comprise:
** the main island of Rapa Iti (),
** the small Marotiri island () in the southeast, part of Rapa municipality
The islands of Maria and Marotiri are not suitable for sustained habitation. Several of the islands have uninhabited islets or rocks off their coastlines.

The chain is associated with the Macdonald hotspot. The only active volcano is the Macdonald seamount (40m depth). 

In administrative terms, the Austral Islands (including the Bass Islands) constitute an administrative subdivision, the Tuha'a Pae or Austral Islands (subdivision administrative des (Îles) Australes), one of French Polynesia's five administrative subdivisions (subdivision administratives). Geographically, the administrative subdivision of the Austral Islands is identical with the constituency of the Austral Islands (circonscription des Îles Australes), one of French Polynesia's six constituencies (circonscriptions électorales) for the Assembly of French Polynesia.

The capital of the Austral Islands administrative subdivision is Tupua'i.
Question:
What is the collective name for the islands with a land area of 4,167 squ km (1,622 squ miles) over 2,500,000 squ km (965,255 squ miles) of ocean, made up of several groups of islands, including the Austral Islands, the Marquesas, the Society Islands and the Tuamotu Archipelago?

Passage:
Last Orders
Last Orders is a 1996 Booker Prize-winning novel by British writer Graham Swift. In 2001 it was adapted for the film Last Orders by Australian writer and director Fred Schepisi.

Plot

The story makes much use of flashbacks to tell the convoluted story of the relationships between a group of war veterans who live in the same corner of London, the backbone of the story being the journey of the group from Bermondsey to Margate to scatter the ashes of Jack Dodds into the sea, in accord with his last wishes. The narrative is split into short sections told by the main characters as well as updates along the journey at Old Kent Road, New Cross, Blackheath, Dartford, Gravesend, Rochester, Chatham Naval Memorial and Canterbury Cathedral. The title 'Last Orders' not only refers to these instructions as stipulated in Jack Dodd's will, but also alludes to the 'last orders (of the day)' - the last round of drinks to be ordered before a pub closes, as drinking was a favourite pastime of Jack and the other characters.

The plot and style are influenced by William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. 

Characters

Jack Dodds: a butcher, husband of Amy. His death from cancer in St Thomas' Hospital brings together four men who take a journey to scatter his ashes.  Played by Michael Caine in the movie.

Vince Dodds: a used car salesman. Adopted son of Jack and Amy Dodds, when his biological parents (the Pritchetts) were killed during the London Blitz.  Played by Ray Winstone in the movie.

Ray 'Lucky' Johnson: an insurance clerk, who has an uncanny ability to wager on the right horses. The main narrator of the book. Fought alongside Jack Dodds in the war, who saved his life on one occasion. Was left by his wife Carol, for another man, and has a daughter Susie, who lives in Australia. Ray is attracted to Amy Dodds, wife of Jack, and the two had a relationship in the past.  Played by Bob Hoskins in the movie.

Lenny 'Gunner' Tate: Drinking buddy of Jack Dodds. The odd man in the group, who is the instigator of many conflicts. Lenny's daughter Sally had a relationship with Vince Dodds, and became pregnant, before marrying a jailbird.  Played by David Hemmings in the movie.

Vic Tucker: an undertaker/funeral director. The backbone of the group, who mediates and keeps the peace when conflicts arise. Many parallels are drawn between Jack's profession and Vic's, in that they both handle bodies.  Played by Tom Courtenay in the movie.

Amy Dodds: Jack's wife, who declines to join the men when they scatter Jack's ashes. Amy and Jack had a mentally disabled daughter, June. On the day the four men travel to Margate to scatter the ashes, Amy visits June in a Home.  Played by Helen Mirren in the movie.

Mandy Dodds: Left her home in Blackburn at age 15 and travelled to London. At Smithfield Meat Market she met Jack who offered her a job and board and lodgings in his house. She went on to marry Jack's adopted son Vince.

Passage:
Richard Booth
Richard George William Pitt Booth, MBE (born 12 September 1938), is a Welsh bookseller, known for his contribution to the success of Hay-on-Wye as a centre for second-hand bookselling.  He is also the self-proclaimed ""King of Hay"".

Booth was born in Hay-on-Wye, Wales. He was educated at Rugby School and the University of Oxford, yet he dreaded seeing how young men like himself left his hometown for the city, and wondered what trade could save this small rural economy. Having inherited the Brynmelyn estate from his uncle, Major Willie Booth, he then opened a second-hand bookshop in Hay-on-Wye, in the old fire station, and took the strongest men of Hay to America, where libraries were closing fast. They bought and shipped books in containers back to Hay-on-Wye. His example was followed by others, so that by the 1970s Hay had become internationally known as the ""Town of Books"".

On 1 April 1977 Richard Booth proclaimed Hay an ""independent kingdom"" with himself as king Richard Cœur de Livre and his horse as Prime Minister. The publicity stunt gained extensive news coverage, and resulted in several spin-offs such as ""passports"" being issued.

On 1 April 2000 Booth followed up with an investiture of ""The Hay House of Lords"" and created 21 new hereditary peers for the ""Kingdom of Hay"".

The Hay Literary Festival was another spin-off from the burgeoning number of bookshops in the town, which now gets an estimated 500,000 tourists a year.  In recognition of his services to tourism, Richard Booth was awarded the MBE in the 2004 New Year Honours List. In August 2005, Richard Booth announced that he was selling his Hay bookshop and moving to Germany. The bookshop is now under ownership of Elizabeth Haycox and has had extensive refurbishment works carried out since 2009.

In the end Richard Booth didn't move to Germany but still lives in Brynmelyn and is still very much the King of Hay. He now, 2014, owns a bookshop in the town called, appropriately The King of Hay.

He married his second wife Hope Stuart, a former freelance photographer, in the 1980s.  In 1999, he published his autobiography, My Kingdom of Books (Y Lolfa, ISBN 0862434955), with the help of his stepdaughter Lucia Stuart.

In 2014 Richard Booth gave his name to an annual literary award in association with the Hay Writers’ Circle.

Passage:
Scottish Grand National
|}

The Scottish Grand National is a Grade 3 National Hunt steeplechase in Great Britain which is open to horses aged five years or older. It is run at Ayr, Scotland, over a distance of approximately 4 miles and 110 yards (6,538 metres) and 27 fences. It is a handicap race, and takes place each year in April.
It is Scotland's equivalent of the Grand National, and is held during Ayr's two-day Scottish Grand National Festival meeting.

History

The race, then known as the ""West of Scotland Grand National"", was first run at a course near Houston, Renfrewshire in 1858.  It consisted of 32 jumps, mainly stone walls.

In 1867, after objections by the leader of the Free Kirk in Houston, the race moved to Bogside Racecourse, near Irvine. The inaugural winner at Bogside, The Elk, was owned by the Duke of Hamilton. During the early part of its history the race's distance was about three miles. It was later extended to 3⅞ miles, and became known by its present title in 1880, when it was won by Peacock.

Bogside Racecourse closed in 1965, and the Scottish Grand National was transferred to Ayr the following year. At this point the race was increased to its present length. Several winners of the Scottish Grand National have also won its English counterpart at Aintree. The first to complete the double was Music Hall, the winner of the 1922 Grand National. The feat has been achieved more recently by Little Polveir and Earth Summit, but the only horse to win both races in the same year was Red Rum in 1974.

Prize money

The winning horse in 1867 won £100, increasing to £440 by 1906, £1030 in 1950, £5,436 in 1963 and  £119,595 in 2015.

Television coverage

The first television coverage of the Scottish National was in 1953 on the BBC.  It was also shown the following year, but then wasn't screened again until 1969 on ITV and has been shown live ever since.  Coverage moved to Channel 4 in 1986.

Roger Hargreaves
Charles Roger Hargreaves (9 May 1935 – 11 September 1988) was an English author and illustrator of children's books, best remembered for the Mr. Men and Little Miss series, intended for very young readers. The simple and humorous stories, with brightly coloured, boldly drawn illustrations, have been part of popular culture since 1971, with sales of over 85 million copies worldwide in 20 languages.

Lifetime 

Birth 

Charles Roger Hargreaves was born in a private hospital  at 201 Bath Road, Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire to Alfred Reginald and Ethel Mary Hargreaves. He grew up  at 703 Halifax Road, Hartshead Moor, Cleckheaton, outside of which there now is a commemorative plaque.

Early life 

Hargreaves  attended Sowerby Bridge Grammar School (now Sowerby Bridge High School).[http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/news/calderdale/are-you-a-sowerby-bridge-high-old-boy-or-girl-share-your-memories-online-at-www-halifaxcourier-co-uk-1-1948091 Sowerby Bridge High Old Boy or Girl at Halifax Courier]. Retrieved 25 May 2015 He then spent a year working in his father's laundry and dry-cleaning business before gaining employment in advertising.  His original ambition was to be a cartoonist, and in 1971, while working as the creative director at a London firm, he wrote the first Mr. Men book, Mr. Tickle. Initially he had difficulty finding a publisher, but once he did the books became an instant success, selling over one million copies within three years. In 1974  the books spawned a BBC animated television series, narrated by Arthur Lowe. A second series the following year saw newer titles transmitted in double bill format with those from the first series.

By 1976, Hargreaves had quit his day job. In 1981 the Little Miss series of books was launched, and in 1983 it also was made into a television series, narrated by Pauline Collins, and her husband John Alderton. Although Hargreaves wrote many other children's stories—including the Timbuctoo series of 25 books, John Mouse and the Roundy and Squarey books—he is best known for his 46 Mr. Men and 33 Little Miss books.

Death 

Between 1975 and 1982 Hargreaves lived with his family on Guernsey. Then they settled at Sussex House Farm near Cowden, Kent. Hargreaves died in 1988 at age 53 at the Kent and Sussex Hospital in Royal Tunbridge Wells following a stroke.  After his death, his son Adam continued writing and drawing the Mr. Men and Little Miss characters with new stories. However, in April 2004 Hargreaves's widow Christine sold the rights to the Mr. Men characters to the UK entertainment group Chorion, for £28 million. 

Family 

Hargreaves and his wife had four children: Adam, Giles and twins Sophie and Amelia. The first of the Mr. Men characters is reported to have been created when Adam, at age 6, asked his father what a tickle looked like. Hargreaves drew a figure with a round orange body and long rubbery arms, which became Mr. Tickle. He recalls that his father was 6ft 5in (1.96 m) tall.[http://sussex.greatbritishlife.co.uk/article/interview-with-adam-hargreaves--mr-men-illustrator-and-writer-17832/ Wintle, Angela.

The book Little Miss Twins was written for Hargreaves' twin daughters.

ABSTRACT
The article presents information on ""Mach,"" the SI unit, used to describe supersonic speed. It was named for Ernst Mach (1838-1916), a Czech-born Austrian physicist. When a plane moves at the speed of sound, it is Mach 1. When the plane is moving at twice the speed of sound, it is Mach 2. Mach may be defined as the ratio of the velocity of a rocket or a jet to the velocity of sound in the medium being considered. Intensity, or loudness, is the strength of the pressure of these radiating waves and is measured in decibels. The speed of sound is generally defined as 1,088 feet per second at sea level at 32ï¿½ F. It varies in other temperatures and in different media. Sound travels faster in water than in air, and even faster in iron and steel.

Wilkins Micawber
Wilkins Micawber is a fictional character from Charles Dickens's 1850 novel, David Copperfield.  He was modelled on Dickens' father, John Dickens, who like Micawber was incarcerated in debtors' prison (the King's Bench Prison) after failing to meet his creditors' demands.

Micawber's long-suffering wife, Emma, stands by him despite his financial exigencies that force her to pawn all of her family's heirlooms.  She lives by the maxims, ""I will never desert Mr. Micawber!"" and ""Experientia does it!"" (from Experientia docet, ""One learns by experience."")
 
Micawber is hired as a clerk by the scheming Uriah Heep, who assumes wrongly that Micawber's debts arise from dishonesty.  But working for Heep allows Micawber to expose his boss as a forger and a cheat. To start anew, Micawber and his family emigrate to Australia with Daniel Peggotty and Little Em'ly, where Micawber becomes manager of the Port Middlebay Bank and a successful government magistrate.

In Hablot Knight Browne's illustrations for the first edition, Micawber is shown wearing knee-breeches, a top hat, and a monocle.

Popular culture

Micawber is known for asserting his faith that ""something will turn up"".  His name has become synonymous with someone who lives in hopeful expectation.  This has formed the basis for the Micawber Principle, based upon his observation:

""Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds nought and six, result misery."" - (Chapter 12)

[The amounts quoted are equivalent to £20, £19 97½p and £20 2½p, in the United Kingdom's present, decimal, currency.]

The character was played by W.C. Fields in the 1935 screen classic, Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger.  Bob Hoskins took the role in a 1999 BBC serial.

Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones named one of his guitars (an early 1950s Fender Telecaster with a Gibson PAF humbucking pickup installed in the neck position) ""Micawber"". Richards is known to be a fan of Dickens. Of the unusual moniker attached to the instrument, Richards said, ""There's no reason for my guitar being called Micawber, apart from the fact that it's such an unlikely name. There's no one around me called Micawber, so when I scream for Micawber everyone knows what I'm talking about.""

In addition, the character formed the basis of Micawber, a 2001 ITV drama series written by John Sullivan and starring David Jason in the title leading role.

In the U.S. Supreme Court opinion of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 562 (2007), Justice Souter criticized the court below for an approach to pleading that ""would dispense with any showing of a reasonably founded hope that a plaintiff would be able to make a case; Mr. Micawber's optimism would be enough."" (quotations and citations omitted).

Entry into general English

The character of Wilkins Micawber has given rise to the English noun ""Micawber"" and the adjectives ""Micawberish"" and ""Micawberesque"". The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a Micawber as ""one who is poor but lives in optimistic expectation of better fortune"".  Judge David Halpern described Craig Whyte's legal arguments in a case heard in 2013 as ""pure Micawberism"". 

Quotations

Besides the Micawber Principle, Micawber is notable for a number of memorable quotations:
* I have no doubt I shall, please Heaven, begin to be more beforehand with the world, and to live in a perfectly new manner, if -if, in short, anything turns up. - (Chapter 1)
* Every happiness and prosperity! If, in the progress of revolving years, I could persuade myself that my blighted destiny had been a warning to you, I should feel that I had not occupied another man's place altogether in vain. - (Chapter 12)
* You HEEP of infamy! - (Chapter 52)
* I trust that the labour and hazard of an investigation -of which the smallest results have been slowly pieced together, in the pressure of arduous avocations, under grinding penurious apprehensions, at rise of morn, at dewy eve, in the shadows of night, under the watchful eye of one whom it were superfluous to call Demon, combined with the struggle of parental Poverty to turn it, when completed, to the right account, may be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet water on my funeral pyre.  I ask no more. Let it be, in justice, merely said of me, as of a gallant and eminent Naval Hero, with whom I have no pretensions to cope, that what I have done, I did, in despite of mercenary and selfish objectives, ""FOR ENGLAND, HOME AND BEAUTY."" Remaining always, &c, &c, Wilkins Micawber.
* Welcome poverty!..Welcome misery, welcome houselessness, welcome hunger, rags, tempest, and beggary! Mutual confidence will sustain us to the end!

Film and television portrayals

Quotations from the 1935 film

*Boy, as I have frequently had occasion to observe: ""When the stomach is empty, the spirits are low!""
* Remember my motto ""Nil Desperandum! -Never despair!""

Quotation from the BBC TV/Masterpiece Theatre production

* (featuring Bob Hoskins as Micawber) ""I could not depart this metropolis without paying a valedictory visit to my dear friend Copperfield, in whose debt I shall forever remain (I speak metaphorically of course!)""

Parthenon (Nashville)
The Parthenon in Nashville, Tennessee is a full-scale replica of the original Parthenon in Athens. It was built in 1897 as part of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition.

Today the Parthenon, which functions as an art museum, stands as the centerpiece of Centennial Park, a large public park just west of downtown Nashville. Alan LeQuire's 1990 re-creation of the Athena Parthenos statue is the focus of the Parthenon just as it was in ancient Greece. The statue of Athena Parthenos within is a reconstruction of the long-lost original to careful scholarly standards: she is cuirassed and helmeted, carries a shield on her left arm and a small 6 ft statue of Nike (Victory) in her right palm, and stands 42 ft high, gilt with more than 8 lb of gold leaf; an equally colossal serpent rears its head between her and her shield. Since the building is complete and its decorations were polychromed (painted in colors) as close to the presumed original as possible, this replica of the original Parthenon in Athens serves as a monument to what is considered the pinnacle of classical architecture. The plaster replicas of the Parthenon Marbles found in the naos (the east room of the main hall) are direct casts of the original sculptures which adorned the pediments of the Athenian Parthenon, dating back to 438 BC. Many fragments of the originals are housed in the British Museum in London; others are at the Acropolis Museum in Athens.

History

Nashville's moniker, the ""Athens of the South"",   influenced the choice of the building as the centerpiece of the 1897 Centennial Exposition. A number of buildings at the Exposition were based on ancient originals, however the Parthenon was the only one that was an exact reproduction. It was also the only one that was preserved by the city, although the Knights of Pythias Pavilion building was purchased and moved to nearby Franklin, Tennessee.

Major Eugene Castner Lewis was the director of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition and it was at his suggestion that a reproduction of the Parthenon be built in Nashville to serve as the centerpiece of Tennessee’s Centennial Celebration. Mr. Lewis also served as the chief civil engineer for the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad. Originally built of plaster, wood, and brick, the Parthenon was not intended to be permanent, but the cost of demolishing the structure combined with its popularity with residents and visitors alike resulted in it being left standing after the Exposition.  In 1895 George Julian Zolnay was ""employed to make models for the ornamentation"" for the building.   Within the next 20 years, weather had defaced the landmark; it was then rebuilt on the same foundations, in concrete, in a project that started in 1920; the exterior was completed in 1925 and the interior in 1931. 

Some of the most elaborate events that occurred at the Parthenon were the Spring Pageants of 1913 and 1914.  These extravaganzas were theatrical productions on a massive scale.  With casts of up to 500, the Pageants brought in audiences from surroundings states and rail prices were lowered to encourage attendance.  The entire city of Nashville reveled in the opportunity to celebrate the ""Athens of the South.""  The 1913 performance was entitled The Fire Regained, a play written by Sidney Mttron Hirsch, and featured a mythological storyline enhanced by theatrical spectacle popular in that era.  The 1914 production, ""The Mystery at Thanatos,"" had a similarly mythological plot, but was shorter and better received.  A copy of the script is on file at the Nashville Public Library. The most impressive thing about these Pageants was the incredible use of visual spectacle.  Both shows featured impressive displays ranging from chariot races to huge dance numbers to thousands of live birds to set pieces that shot flames, all set against the backdrop of the majestic Nashville Parthenon.

As an art museum, the Parthenon's permanent collection is a group of 63 paintings by 19th- and 20th-century American artists donated by James M. Cowan. Additional gallery spaces provide a venue for a variety of temporary shows and exhibits.

In the summertime, local theatre productions use the building as a backdrop for classic Greek plays such as Euripides' Medea and Sophocles' Antigone, performing (usually for free) on the steps of the Parthenon. Other performances, such as Mary Zimmerman's Metamorphoses, have been done inside, at the foot of Athena's statue.

It contains a replica, completed in 1990, of the Athena Parthenos statue which was in the original Parthenon in Athens.

The Parthenon got a full makeover in 2002 with a much needed cleaning and restoration to the exterior. The exterior lighting was upgraded to allow the columns of building to be illuminated with different colors than the facade, allowing a uniquely versatile display of effects for events.

In popular culture

The Parthenon served as the location for the political rally in the climactic scene of Robert Altman's 1975 film Nashville. It was also used as a backdrop for the battle against the Hydra in the 2010 film Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. It features in the title and lyrics of the song Nashville Parthenon from the album Etiquette, by Casiotone for the Painfully Alone. It was used in the 2000 PBS series Greeks: Crucible of Civilization.

Passage:
Singapore in Malaysia
Singapore was one of the 14 states of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965. Malaysia was formed on 16 September 1963 as a new political entity from the merger of the Federation of Malaya with former British colonies of North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore. This marked the end of a 144-year period of British rule in Singapore, beginning with the founding of modern Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819.

The union, however, was unstable due to distrust and ideological differences between leaders of the State of Singapore and the federal government of Malaysia. Such issues resulted in frequent disagreements relating to economics, finance and politics. The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which was the political party in power in the federal government, saw the participation of the Singapore-based People's Action Party (PAP) in the Malaysian general election of 1964 as a threat to its Malay-based political system. There were also major racial riots that year involving the majority Chinese community and the Malay community in Singapore. During a 1965 Singaporean by-election, UMNO threw its support behind the opposition Barisan Sosialis candidate. In 1965, Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman decided upon the expulsion of Singapore from the Federation, leading to the independence of Singapore on 9 August 1965. 

Background

The People's Action Party (PAP) won the first election in Singapore after the merger. 

Racial tensions

Racial tensions increased dramatically within a year. They were fuelled by the Barisan Sosialis's tactics of stirring up communal sentiment as the pro-Communist party sought to use means to survive against the crackdown by both the government of Singapore and the Federal Government. In particular, despite the Malaysian government conceding citizenship to the many Chinese immigrants after independence, in Singapore the Chinese disdained the Federal policies of affirmative action, which granted special privileges to the Malays guaranteed under Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia. These included financial and economic benefits that were preferentially given to Malays and the recognition of Islam as the sole official religion, although non-Muslims maintained freedom of worship.

Malays and Muslims in Singapore were being increasingly incited by the Federal Government's accusations that the PAP was mistreating the Malays. Numerous racial riots resulted, and curfews were frequently imposed to restore order. The external political situation was also tense at the time, with Indonesia actively against the establishment of the Federation of Malaysia. President Sukarno of Indonesia declared a state of Konfrontasi (Confrontation) against Malaysia and initiated military and other actions against the new nation, including the bombing of MacDonald House in Singapore in March 1965 by Indonesian commandos which killed three people.  Indonesia also conducted seditious activities to provoke the Malays against the Chinese.  One of the more notorious riots was the 1964 race riots that took place on Prophet Muhammad's birthday on 21 July, near Kallang Gasworks; twenty-three were killed and hundreds injured. More riots broke out in September 1964. The price of food skyrocketed when the transport system was disrupted during this period of unrest, causing further hardship. The Singapore Government later named 21 July each year as Racial Harmony Day.

Disagreement

The Federal Government of Malaysia, dominated by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), was concerned that as long as Singapore remained in the Federation, the bumiputera policy of affirmative action for Malays and the indigenous population would be undermined and therefore run counter to its agenda of addressing economic disparities between racial groups. One of the major concerns was that the PAP continued to ignore these disparities in their repeated cry for a ""Malaysian Malaysia"" – the equal treatment of all races in Malaysia by the government which should serve Malaysian citizens without any regard for the economic conditions of any particular race. Another contributor was the fear that the economic dominance of Singapore's port would inevitably shift political power away from Kuala Lumpur in time, should Singapore remain in the Federation.

The state and federal governments also had disagreements on the economic front. Despite an earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore did not extend to Sabah and Sarawak the full extent of the loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states. The situation escalated to such an intensity that talks soon broke down and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides. UMNO extremists called for the arrest of Lee Kuan Yew.

Expulsion

On 7 August 1965, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed, advised the Parliament of Malaysia that it should vote to expel Singapore from Malaysia. Despite last-ditch attempts by PAP leaders, including Lee Kuan Yew, to keep Singapore as a state in the union, the Parliament on 9 August 1965 voted 126–0 in favor of the expulsion of Singapore, with Members of Parliament from Singapore not present. On that day, a tearful Lee announced that Singapore was a sovereign, independent nation and assumed the role of Prime Minister of the new nation. His speech included this quote: ""I mean for me, it would be a moment of anguish because all my life….you see the whole of my adult life…. I have believed in Malaysia, merger and the unity of the two territories. You know it's a people connected by geography, economics, and ties of kinship... ."" 

Under constitutional amendments passed in December that year, the new state became the Republic of Singapore, with the Yang di-Pertuan Negara becoming President, and the Legislative Assembly becoming the Parliament of Singapore. These changes were made retroactive to the date of Singapore's separation from Malaysia. The Malaya and British Borneo dollar remained legal tender until the introduction of the Singapore dollar in 1967. Before the currency split, there were discussions about a common currency between the Malaysian and Singaporean Governments.

Heptathlon
A heptathlon is a track and field combined events contest made up of seven events. The name derives from the Greek hepta (seven) and athlon (contest). A competitor in a heptathlon is referred to as a heptathlete.

There are two heptathlons – the women's heptathlon and the men's – composed of different events. The men's heptathlon is older and is held indoors, while the women's is held outdoors and was introduced in the 1980s, first appearing in the Olympics in 1984.

Women's heptathlon

Women's heptathlon is the combined event for women contested in the Athletics program of the Olympics and in the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The IAAF World Combined Events Challenge determines a yearly women's heptathlon champion. The women's outdoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and the remaining three on day two:

* 100 metres hurdles
* High jump
* Shot put
* 200 metres
* Long jump
* Javelin throw 
* 800 metres

The heptathlon has been contested by female athletes since the early 1980s, when it replaced the pentathlon as the primary women's combined event contest (the javelin throw and 800 m were added).  It was first contested at the Olympic level in the 1984 Summer Olympics. In recent years some women's decathlon competitions have been conducted, consisting of the same events as the men's competition in a slightly different order, and the IAAF has begun keeping records for it, but the heptathlon remains the championship-level combined event for women. Jessica Ennis-Hill, representing Great Britain, is the 2012 Olympic Gold Medallist and the current World Champion.

There is also a Tetradecathlon, which is a double heptathlon, consisting of 14 events, seven events per day.

Points system

The heptathlon scoring system was devised by Dr Karl Ulbrich, a Viennese mathematician. The formulae are constructed so that, for each event, a designated ""standard"" performance (for example, approximately 1.82 m for the high jump) scores 1000 points.  Each event also has a minimum recordable performance level (e.g. 0.75 m for the high jump), corresponding to zero points. The formulae are devised so that successive constant increments in performance correspond to gradually increasing increments in points awarded.

The events are split into three groups, and the scores are calculated according to the three formulae: 

Running events (200 m, 800 m and 100 m hurdles):
:P = a \cdot (b - T)^c
Jumping events (high jump and long jump):
:P = a \cdot (M - b)^c
Throwing events (shot put and javelin):
:P = a \cdot (D - b)^c

P is for points, T is for time in seconds, M is for height or length in centimeters and D is length in meters. a, b and c have different values for each of the events (see table).

Benchmarks

The following table shows the benchmark levels required to earn 1000 points in each event of the heptathlon:

Women's world records compared to heptathlon bests

Men's heptathlon

 

The other version is an indoor competition, normally contested by men only. It is the men's combined event in the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics. The men's indoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and remaining three on day two:

* 60 metres
* long jump
* shot put
* high jump
* 60 metres hurdles
* pole vault
* 1000 metres

The scoring is similar for both versions. In each event, the athlete scores points for his/her performance in each event according to scoring tables issued by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).  The athlete accumulating the highest number of points wins the competition.

Benchmarks

The following table shows the minimum benchmark levels required to earn 1000 points in each event of the heptathlon:

Trinity College London
Trinity College London (TCL) is an international exam board based in London, England. Trinity offers qualifications across a range of disciplines in the performing arts and English language learning and teaching. The board conducts exams in over 70 countries.

Trinity College London was founded as the external exams board of Trinity College of Music (known today as the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance), and began offering exams in music to external students in 1877. Over time, Trinity expanded to offer exams in other areas of the performing arts and in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL).

Performing arts examinations

In 2004, Trinity College London's performing arts examinations division merged with the external examinations department of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama to form the Trinity Guildhall examinations board. The name Trinity Guildhall was dropped in 2012, and the board's performing arts examinations are now offered under the Trinity College London brand.

Music
 
Trinity College London offers graded musical qualifications for musical theory and for performance in a range of string instruments, singing, piano, electronic keyboards, brass, woodwind instruments and percussion. The grading begins with the Initial Grade, and then are numbered from Grade 1 to Grade 8 in increasing difficulty. Candidates are rated under three categories – the performance of musical pieces, technical work such as scales, and supporting tests such as sight reading and improvisation.  Candidates are graded on a scale from 1 to 100, with 60 being the pass mark. Candidates have some flexibility in the choices of pieces and tests prepared for each of these sections.

In addition to graded examinations, TCL also offers foundation, intermediate and advanced certificates in music.
TCL also offers diplomas in music at three levels - Associate (ATCL), Licentiate (LTCL) and Fellowship (FTCL).

In 2012, the exam board introduced Rock & Pop graded examinations for bass, drums, guitar, keyboards and vocals.

Drama and performance

Trinity College London offers a choice of qualifications for students and teachers of drama and speech subjects at all levels of experience and ability. Exams can be taken by individuals, pairs or groups. Study strands include Speech and Drama, Individual Acting Skills, Group Performance, Shakespeare, Choral Speaking, Communication Skills, Musical Theatre and Performance Arts.

As is the case with music, diplomas in drama, performance and communication subjects are also offered at three levels, and TCL is the awarding body for the series of professional performing arts courses that are funded in part by the Dance and Drama Awards scheme.

Arts Award

Within the United Kingdom, Trinity College London manages  Arts Award in association with Arts Council England. 

Language examinations

Assessments in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) were first offered by Trinity College London in 1938. Trinity College London ESOL currently offers certificates for non-native speakers of English, and in Teaching English for Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) for teachers of non-native speakers of English.

Known to cricketing colleagues and cricket fans as ""Arkle"" after the racehorse, but always ""Rags"" to himself, he was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1980. Randall played 47 and 49 matches for England before retiring as a right-handed batsman. He came to note as a cover fielder, as one-day cricket forced him to improve fielding standards to improve his run out of Gordon Greenidge in the 1979 Cricket World Cup final. His partnership with David Gower was a feature of the successful England team of the post-Packer era of the 1970s. He is now a coach and cricket writer at the University of Nottingham.

Derek Randall is a former English cricketer. He made 28,456 runs in all first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire. His highest Test score was 174 against Dennis Lillee in the Centenary Test in Melbourne in 1977. He took the catch which clinched the Ashes in 1977 at Headingley, turning a cartwheel in celebration. He retired in 1993, but later turned out in Minor Counties cricket for Suffolk, playing in the NatWest Trophy at the age of 49, and in a match for ""Old Suffolk"" in 2004. The 'Derek. Randall Suite' at Trent Bridge is named after him. He also coached Cambridge University and Bedford School. Randall was often the selectors' scapegoat for England's failings, and his Test batting positions ranged from number one to seven. He was famous for running, rather than walking, towards the batsman in the covers as the bowler delivered the ball and was responsible for many run-outs. He played in more Tests than his Nottinghamshire alumni, such as Reg Simpson, Harold Larwood, Bill Voce, Joe Hardstaff senior, Joe. Hardstaff junior and Arthur Shrewsbury. Randall also coached the Bedfordshire County Championship side in the early 1980s. He died in a car crash in 2007. He is survived by his wife, two children and a step-daughter. He has a son and two step-grandchildren. He had a daughter and a son-in-law, both of whom are also former cricketers. Randall is the grandfather of two-year-old son, Jack. The couple have a daughter, Charlotte, who was born in May 2011. Randall has a daughter who was a first-grade pupil at Retford Cricket Club, and also played for the Nottinghamshire second XI in the 1970s and 1980s, before moving on to play for Cambridge University. Randall played for Nottingham County Cricket Club in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and was a member of Nottinghamshire's successful County Championship team of the early 80s, winning the County Championship in 1984. He scored 1,000 runs in a season eight times, took 361 catches and 13 wickets at 31.00, compared to Richard Hadlee's 45. Charlie the Tuna is the cartoon mascot and spokes-tuna for the StarKist brand. He was created by Tom Rogers of the Leo Burnett Agency in 1961. Charlie the T tuna is the name of a brand of tuna currently owned by Dongwon Industries, a South Korea-based conglomerate. The oldest hieroglyph representing a Senet game dates to around 3100 BC. The full name of the game in Egyptian was zn.t n.t ḥˁb meaning the ""game of passing"".Senet is one of the oldest known board games. It has been found in predynastic and First Dynasty burials of Egypt, c. 3500 BC and 3100BC respectively. A Senet board has two sets of pawns (at least five of each or, in some sets, more or, as well as shorter games with fewer) The game is referred to in Chapter XVII of the Book of the Dead, and the game is also depicted in a painting in the tomb of Rashepes (c. 2500 BC). By the time of the New Kingdom in Egypt (1550–1077 BC), it had become a kind of talisman for the journey of the dead. It was believed that a successful player was under the protection of the major gods of the national pantheon: the sun deity Ra, the wisdom deity Thoth, and sometimes the afterlife deity Osiris. The gameboard is a grid of 30 squares, arranged in three rows of ten, and is thought to be the oldest board game in the world. It is thought that Senet boards were often placed in the grave alongside other useful objects for the dangerous journey through the afterlife. Their rules have been adopted by sellers of modern Senet sets, and are known as the ""Senet rules"" The rules of Senet have been reconstructed by historians Timothy Kendall and R. C. Bell, respectively, and have been used to sell modern sets of the board game. The rules are based on the original Senet rules, which were drawn up by the two men who designed the modern set. The original rules were published in the book Senet: A History of the Board Game, published by Piatkus & Co. in 1998. The book is available in hardback and paperback for £16.99 ($24.99) with a print run of 1,000 copies. The price includes a free copy of the book and a free DVD of the film The Sun Has Got His Hat On. ""Sorry, Charlie"" became closely associated with StarKist and was also a popular American catchphrase. Charlie appeared in more than 85 advertisements for Starkist until the 1980s, when the campaign was retired. Charlie made a comeback in 1999, when StarKists revived him to introduce their new line of healthier tuna products. An ossuary is a chest, box, building, well, or site made to serve as the final resting place of human skeletal remains. A body is first buried in a temporary grave, then after some years the skeletal remains are removed and placed in an ossuel. The use of ossuaries is a longstanding tradition in the Orthodox Church. The remains of an Orthodox Christian are treated with reverence, in conformity with the biblical teaching that the body of a believer is atemple ""temple otemple"" ""Who do you think I am? Charlie the Tuna?"" is a popular catchphrase in hip-hop music. ""The Big Tuna"" is a nickname given to football coach Bill Parcells by an incredulous player who thought he was ""Charlie the T tuna"" The name Charlie Tuna was given to a Los Angeles radio personality and voiceover artist Art Ferguson by a radio station in Oklahoma City. The name ""Charlie"" was picked out of a hat by the station's disc jockey Chuck Riley, who used the name for a week, and then left. His replacement, Art Ferguson, inherited the name, and he would keep the name upon relocating first to Boston and then Los Angeles. ""Ossuary"" means ""the place for the bones"" in the Zoroastrian religion, and is used to store the remains of Zoroastrians from the earliest times (c. 3,000 years ago) and called it astudan (literally, "" the place of the bones""). There are many rituals and regulations in the Persian faith concerning the astudans. The catacombs of Paris represent another ossule in the Roman Catholic Church, also the Monastery of San Lima, Peru, also contains an oSSuary in the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Catacombs in Paris represent the catapombs of the Catholic Church of St. John the Evangelist, also known as ""The Redeemer of the Cross"" The Catacomb of San Francisco represents the famous Battle of the Pyrenees, which took place in 1453. In Orthodox monasteries, when one of the brethren dies, his remains are buried (for details, see Christian burial) for one to three years, and then disinterred, cleaned and gathered into the monastery's charnel house. If there is reason to believe that the departed is a saint, the remains may be placed in a reliquary. The use of ossuaries is also found among the laity in the Greek Orthodox Church. During the time of the Second Temple, Jewish burial customs included primary burials in burial caves, followed by secondary burials. The custom of secondary burial did not persist among Jews past the Second temple period nor appear to exist among Jews outside the land of Israel. The song was made popular by David Brooks and Marion Bell in the 1947 musical Brigadoon. It was later performed in the 1954 film version by Gene Kelly. There were three hit versions of the song in the United States in 1947. Frank Sinatra's version was the highest charting at #20. Mildred Bailey and Mary Martin both charted with the song at #21 that year. Nat King Cole recorded more than one version, including a later version that was used as the closing song in 1993 movie Groundhog Day which starred Bill Murray. Shirley Bassey performs this song as a medley with the Oscar-winning song ""Almost Like Being in Love"" (1952) Lester Young – Lester Young with Trio – Lester Trio (1919**) and Michael Johnson (#32, 1978) It was revived in a downbeat ballad version by singer Michael Johnson in the 1970s and 1980s. It has been performed by Dame Judy Garland, Ms. Bassey, Judy Garland and Lester Young, among others. The music was written by Frederick Loewe, and the lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner. It features a ii–V–I turnaround in G, a pair of similar 2-5-1 sequences in E major and D major for the bridge, after which it raises the refrain a half-step with a 2- 5-1 in A flat major. It is in the key of G major like the original, with a ii-V-I turnaround (2-5–I in G) in the bridge. It also features a two-step sequence in D major and E major. The Western roll is a high jump technique invented by George Horine of Stanford University. The Western roll was the catalyst for two changes in the rules of high jumping. Walt Davis was the last Western roll jumper to hold the world record, jumping 6 ft in 1953. In 1961, Judy Garland performed the song as a medley with ""This Can't Be Love"" at her Judy at Carnegie Hall concert.

It also enabled a comfortable landing in the crude sand pits provided for high jumpers up until the 1950s. In French, a brochette is a skewer, and foods cooked on a skewwer are said to be en brochete. In Greece, it is known as souvlaki, while Thais call it satay and many Middle Easterners know it as kabob. Brochette may be served on its own, sometimes with a dipping sauce, or it may be part of a larger plate. It is a common inclusion at buffet spreads, since brochettes can be easily picked up and handled by guests. In some parts of the American south, especially Louisiana, many types of brochetttes are available, an enduring testimony to the French cultural influence in these areas. The word has been adopted into the English language, and English speakers usually interpret ‘brochette’ to refer to food which has been cooked onA skewer. Foods are pierced with the skewer for cooking, whether they are grilled, baked, sauteed, roasted, or broiled. Typically, foods are coated in a marinade or rub before they are cooked. Meats such as lamb, chicken, game, and seafood are common offerings in brochetes. Vegetables and fruits can also be used, and many cooks mix the two for flavor variation. For a very basicMarinade try mixing olive vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, finely chopped onions, rosemary, and pepper. Cut the food into evenly sized chunks, and marinate it for at least half an hour before putting it on the skewers. Cook it with your choice of choice, using your method of choice and serve it with warm slices of lemon slices or slices of warm bread.

They resemble deer and are in the same family as goats, cattle and sheep. Gazelles can reach speeds of 50 mph (80 kph) and roams about the open, grassy plains of Africa. To stay hydrated in these grueling environments, gazellers shrink their heart and liver to help them breathe less and lose less water. Some gazelle herds have as many as 700 members, though some herds are small and segregated by gender. There are 19 species of Gazelle, with the largest weighing 88 to 165 pounds (40 to 75 kg) and standing 4.5 to 5.5 feet tall (137 to 168 cm) The Edmi Gazelle is the only g Gazelle that lives in the mountains. It migrates during the wintertime to warmer regions during the summer. The Thomson's Gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii) has a white patch on its rump that extends beyond its tail onto its back. The dama Gazelle has white spots or stripes on its coats that help it escape from predators. It weighs in at 88 to165 pounds ( 40 to 75kg) and is 4. 5 to 5 feet tall. The Speke Gazelle weighs only 20 to 43 inches (51 to 109 centimeters) at the shoulder. It has tan or reddish-brown coats and white rumps. It lives in hot, dry savannas and deserts of Africa and. Asia and migrates in the summertime to warm regions. It can reach speed of up to 60 mph in short bursts and sustain speeds of 30 to 40 mph when running. When running, Gazelle use a bounding leap, called ""pronking"" or ""stotting,"" which involves stiffly springing into the air with all four feet. It is believed that Benjamin Franklin was among the first to wear bocal lenses. Historians have produced some evidence to suggest that others may have come before him in the invention; however, a correspondence between George Whatley and John Fenno, editor of The Gazette of the United States, suggested that Franklin had indeed invented bifocals, and perhaps perhaps 50 years earlier than had been originally thought. Since many inventions have been developed independently by one person, it is possible that the invention of b ifocals may have been been been made by many people at once. Two separate lenses were cut in half and combined together in the rim of the frame. The mounting of two half lenses into a single frame led to a number of early complications and rendered such spectacles quite fragile. A method for fusing the sections of the lenses together was developed by Louis de Wecker at the end of the 19th century and patented by Dr. John L. Borsch, Jr. in 1908. Today most bifocals are created by molding a reading segment into a primary lens and are available with the reading segments in a variety of shapes and sizes. The most popular is the D-segment, 28 mm wide, which offers superior optics. An increasing number of people opt for progressive bifocal lenses. New materials and technologies may provide a method which can selectively adjust the optical power of a lens. The larval stage of the diving beetle Thermonectus marmoratus has, in its principal eyes, two retinas and two distinct focal planes that are substantially separated (in the manner of bifOCals) to switch their vision from up-close to distance, for easy and efficient capture of their prey, mostly mosquito larvae. The Austral Islands are the southernmost group of islands in French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of France in the South Pacific. They consist of two separate archipelagos, namely in the northwest the Tupua'i islands and in the southeast the Bass Islands. The islands of Maria and Marotiri are not suitable for sustained habitation. Several of the islands have uninhabited islets or rocks off their coastlines. The population of the Austral Islands' population is about 6,300 on almost 150 km2. It consists of: Îles Maria, Rimatara, Rūrutu, Tupua’i Island proper and Ra’ivāvae, and the small islands of Rapa Iti and MarOTiri. It is not known who invented the bifoocal lens, but it is believed to have been invented by a tradesman of Philidelphia, New York. The first recorded use of bi-focal technology in the animal world was in the larval stages of the mosquito larvae, which have two separate eyes and two separate focal planes for up- Close to distance vision. In an interesting legal case reported in the UK in 1969, plaintiff’s ability to use b ifocals was impaired by accident. Last Orders is a 1996 Booker Prize-winning novel by British writer Graham Swift. In 2001 it was adapted for the film Last Orders by Australian writer and director Fred Schepisi. The story makes much use of flashbacks to tell the story of a group of war veterans who live in the same corner of London. The title 'Last Orders' not only refers to these instructions as stipulated in Jack Dodd's will, but also alludes to the 'last orders (of the day)' - the last round of drinks to be ordered before a pub closes. The plot and style are influenced by William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. The capital of the Austral Islands administrative subdivision is Tupua'i. Several of the islands have uninhabited islets or rocks off their coastlines. The chain is associated with the Macdonald hotspot. The only active volcano is the MacDonald seamount (40m depth). In administrative terms, theAustral Islands constitute an administrative subdivision, the Tuha'a Pae or Austral Islands (subdivision administrative des (Îles) Australes) One of French Polynesia's five administrative subdivisions ( subdivision administratives) Geographically, the administrative subdivision of Austral Islands is identical with the constituency of the Austral Islands (circonscription des Îles Australes), one of the six constituencies for the Assembly of FrenchPolynesia. The island chain is made up of several groups of islands, including the Marquesas, the Society Islands and the Tuamotu Archipelago. It has a land area of 4,167 squ km. over 2,500,000 squ km (965,255 squ miles) of ocean. It is also home to the Bass Islands, which are one of France's most popular tourist attractions. It also has a population of 1,200,000 (1,000,000 per cent of the French population). It is the only island chain in the Pacific Ocean that is not home to a major tourist attraction, such as the Grand Canyon or the Galapagos Islands. The islands have a landArea of 4.167 sq km (1.622 sq miles) over 1,622 squ miles. The population is 1,716,000. The total land area is 2,569,000 sq km. Richard George William Pitt Booth, MBE (born 12 September 1938), is a Welsh bookseller. He is known for his contribution to the success of Hay-on-Wye as a centre for second-hand bookselling. In April 1977 he proclaimed Hay an ""independent kingdom"" with himself as king Richard Cœur de Livre and his horse as Prime Minister. The publicity stunt gained extensive news coverage, and resulted in several spin-offs such as ""passports"" being issued. In August 2005, Richard Booth announced that he was selling his Hay bookshop and moving to Germany. In the end Richard Booth didn't move to Germany but still lives in Brynmelyn and is still very much the King of Hay. He now, 2014, owns a bookshop in the town called, appropriately The King ofHay. He married his second wife Hope Stuart, a former freelance photographer, in the 1980s. In 1999, he published his autobiography, My Kingdom of Books (Y Lolfa, ISBN 0862434955), with the help of his stepdaughter Lucia Stuart. In 2014 Richard Booth gave his name to an annual literary award in association with the Hay Writers’ Circle. The winners of the Richard Booth Prize for Non-Fiction are as follows: 	Judge – Rachel Cooke - Winner - Jo Jones - Winner – Colin McDowell - Winner                   2015 – 	 judge – ColinMcDowell – Winner - Emma van Woerkom – Winner – Jo Jones – Winner                    2015 –                  2014 –                                 ‘Last Orders’ by Graham Swift, published by Hodder & Stoughton, £16.99, is a 1996 Booker winning novel. The book is about the life of a schoolboy who becomes a soldier in the First World War. It is also about the death of his father, who was killed in the Second World War, and his mother, who died in a car crash in the 1950s. The novel is the first of a series of books on the history of the town of Hay, including accounts of its history and the development of the bookselling trade in the 20th century. It was written by Booth's nephew, Major Willie Booth, and is published by Loughborough University Press, £12.99. It has been translated into several languages, including German, French and Spanish. Several winners of the Scottish Grand National have also won its English counterpart at Aintree. The first to complete the double was Music Hall, the winner of the 1922 Grand National. The only horse to win both races in the same year was Red Rum in 1974. The winning horse in 1867 won £100, increasing to £440 by 1906, £1030 in 1950, £5,436 in 1963 and  £119,595 in 2015. The inaugural winner at Bogside, The Elk, was owned by the Duke of Hamilton. During the early part of its history the race's distance was about three miles. It was later extended to 3⅞ miles, and became known by its present title in 1880, when it was won by Peacock. Bogside Racecourse closed in 1965, and the Scottish National was transferred to Ayr the following year. At this point the race was increased to its present length. The race was first shown on the BBC in 1953 and has been shown live ever since. It wasn't screened again until 1969 on ITV, and coverage moved to Channel 4 in 1986. The last time it was shown live was on Channel 4, in 1986, and it was also shown on Channel 5, in 2007 and 2009. The Scottish National is one of the most popular horse races in Britain. It has been won by more horses than any other race in the UK (including the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the Chelmsford Gold Cup) and has won more than £1.5million in prize money. It is the most successful British Grand National race, beating the English Grand National by more than half a million pounds. The winner of this year's race will be crowned at Ayr on Sunday. The event is the oldest in the world, having been run for the first time since it began in 1866. It will be held in front of a crowd of 12,000 people in Ayr, with a capacity of 2,000. The course is one mile and a half miles in length, with the distance increased from three miles to three miles in 1880. The National has been held on the opening day of every year since 1867, and has now been run on the second day of each month since 1881. The current course is the same as that used to be used in the first year of the race. The distance is 3.2 miles and the race is now 3.3 miles and 1.5 miles. There have been more than 100 winners of this race, the most recent of which was in 2013. Charles Roger Hargreaves is best known for his Mr. Men and Little Miss books. The books have sold over 85 million copies worldwide in 20 languages. He died in 1988 at age 53 at the Kent and Sussex Hospital in Royal Tunbridge Wells following a stroke. His widow Christine sold the rights to the characters to the UK entertainment group Chorion, for £28 million in 2004. Google celebrated his 76th birthday 9 May 2011, with a series of 16 Doodles on its global homepage. He is buried in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, with his wife, Giles, and twins Sophie and Amelia. His son Adam continued writing and drawing the characters with new stories after his father's death. He also wrote many other children's stories, including the Timbuctoo series of 25 books, John Mouse and the Roundy and Squarey books, and Easy Peasy People (also by Gray Jolliffe) The first of the Mr. men characters is reported to have been created when Adam, at age 6, asked his father what a tickle looked like. He recalls that his father was 6ft 5in (1.96 m) tall. The book Little Miss Twins was written for Harg reaves' twin daughters. He was married to his wife Giles for more than 30 years, until his death in 1988. He had four children: Adam, Giles and twins Sophia and Amelia, as well as a son, Giles Harg Reaves, and a daughter, Emma, who was born in 1968. He has a son and two step-daughters, Emma and Emma HargReaves, who are both now adults. He wrote the first Mr. Man book, Mr. Tickle, in 1971, and the Little Miss series of books in 1981. The Little Miss book series was made into a television series in 1983, narrated by Pauline Collins, and her husband John Alderton. The Mr Men books have been made into two TV series, the first in 1974 and the second in 1976, both in double bill format with those from the first series. They have also appeared in a number of other languages, including English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Spanish and German. He drew Mr. Small and Mr Small in several books, including Mr. Potto and Mr Hippo Potto, and Mr. Squarey and Mr Roundy, and has appeared in many other books and magazines, including The New York Review of Books, The New Yorker, The Saturday Review of Literature and The Sunday Times. The prefix Mach is used to describe supersonic speed. When the plane is moving at twice the speed of sound, it is Mach 2. Intensity, or loudness, is the strength of the pressure of these radiating waves and is measured in decibels. Sound travels faster in water than in air, and even faster in iron and steel. Mach may be defined as the ratio of the velocity of a rocket or a jet to the Velocity of sound in the medium. Mach was named for Czech-born Austrian physicist Ernst Mach, whose name was given to the Mach number, the velocity. of a body in a medium relative to the speed to sound in that medium. He sought to understand knowledge in the context of the term ""empiriocriticism"" (empiricism is a form of positivism). Mach also made an important contribution to science in a fundamental reappraisal of scientific thought. The term Mach was used to refer to a theory of thought experiments by Ernst Mach. It refers to a name for the version of. positivism developed by Austrian physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach and the German. Richard Avenarius on this view of appearances, on which:After. the most economical description of appearances: ""Apex"" (Apex) is a definition of apex by The Free Dictionary. The definition of the word ""passage"" is: ""Passage"" (passage) is the term used to mean the appearance of a person or object in a public place, such as on a street or in a building. Mach is the name given to an Austrian physicist who developed the concept of ""thought experiments"" to explain the nature of the universe. He is also known as the ""father"" of the theory of quantum mechanics, which he developed in the late 1800s and early 1900s. He died in 1916, and was buried in Vienna, Austria. He was buried next to his wife, who is also a Nobel Laureate in Physics. He had a son and a daughter, both of whom have died in recent years. Mach's name is also the name of a group of scientists who have worked on the subject of quantum theory, including James Clerk Maxwell and James Clerk Searle, who worked at the University of California, Los Angeles, and on the basis of Mach's theories on quantum mechanics. Mach has been called the father of quantum physics. He also helped to develop the idea of ""quantum theory"" in the 1940s. The highest point of a structure, object, or geometric figure.

He was modelled on Dickens' father, John Dickens, who like Micawber was incarcerated in debtors' prison. Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones named one of his guitars (an early 1950s Fender Telecaster with a Gibson PAF humbucking pickup installed in the neck position) ""Micawbers"" The character was played by W.C. Fields in the 1935 screen classic, Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation ofDavid Copperfield the Younger. The character formed the basis of the 2001 ITV drama series Micawbers, starring John Sullivan and Jason Sullivan in the title of the U.S. Supreme Court opinion of B.S.'s decision to strike down the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution. The book is published by Simon & Schuster and is available in paperback and hardback.

Wilkins Micawber is a character in Charles Dickens's ""David Copperfield"" He is known for his optimistic outlook on life. His quotes include: ""Welcome poverty!..Welcome misery, welcome hunger, rags, tempest, and beggary!"" The Parthenon in Nashville, Tennessee is a full-scale replica of the original in Athens, Greece. It was built in 1897 as part of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. It functions as an art museum, as well as the centerpiece of Centennial Park, a large public park just west of downtown Nashville. The 1990 recreation of the Athena Parthenos statue is just as it was in Greece. The Athena is a reconstruction of the ancient statue of Athena, with its head between her shield and a serpent. Since the 1970s, the Partheno has been used as a tourist attraction in the city of Nashville. It is also used as the site of the annual Centennial of the Centenary of the Battle of the Bulge, which took place in 1864. It has also been used for the opening of the World Series of Poker, which began in 1974. It also hosts the annual World Series Baseball Game, which takes place in the same year as the World Cup. The World Series is held in New York City, where it is held every year until the end of the baseball season. The U.S. Open tennis tournament, which started in 1974, is held at the grounds of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The National Museum of American History, which was founded in 1876, is located in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Museum is also home to the National Gallery of Art, which dates back to 17th century. The American Museum of Natural History, in Washington, D.C., was established in 1878. The museum is the only one of its kind in the United States. It houses the American National Museum, which opened in 1881. The US National Gallery, which is based in New Jersey, is the oldest continuously operating museum in the world. It dates back more than 100 years to the 18th century, and was the birthplace of the American Revolution. The first American president, George H.W. Bush, was born in 1858, and served as president from 1861 to 1868. He was the son of a Scottish father and a Scottish mother. He is the great-great-grandfather of the current president, Jimmy Carter, and the grandson of former British Prime Minister Edward VII. Nashville's moniker, the ""Athens of the South"", influenced the choice of the building as the centerpiece of the 1897 Centennial Exposition. Originally built of plaster, wood, and brick, the Parthenon was not intended to be permanent, but the cost of demolishing the structure combined with its popularity with residents and visitors alike resulted in it being left standing. It was then rebuilt on the same foundations, in concrete, in a project that started in 1920; the exterior was completed in 1925 and the interior in 1931. It contains a replica, completed in 1990, of the Athena Parthenos statue which was in the original parthenon in Athens. It also contains a group of 63 paintings by 19th- and 20th-century American artists donated by James M. Cowan. Additional gallery spaces provide a venue for a variety of temporary shows and exhibits. In the summertime, local theatre productions use theBuilding as a backdrop for classic Greek plays such as Euripides' Medea and Sophocles' Antigone. Other performances, such as Mary Zimmerman's Metamorphoses, have been done inside, at the foot of Athena's statue. It is now an art museum, with a permanent collection of 63 works of art by 19-20th century American artists. It has been open to the public since 1931 and is currently home to the Nashville Museum of Art, which has a collection of more than 2,000 pieces of art, many of which are on display in the museum's galleries. The museum is also home to a large collection of plaster replicas of the Marbles found in the naos (the east room of the main hall) which date back to 438 BC. The plaster replica of the Parthenson Marbles are direct casts of the original sculptures which adorned the pediments of the Athenian Parthen on. Many fragments of the originals are housed in the British Museum in London; others are at the Acropolis Museum in Athens, and are on show at the Museum of the History of Art in Athens as well. The Parthenon served as the location for the political rally in the climactic scene of Robert Altman's 1975 film Nashville. It was also used as a backdrop for the battle against the Hydra in the 2010 film Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. It features in the title and lyrics of the song Nashville Partenon from the album Etiquette, by Casiotone for the Painfully Alone. It also appeared in the 2000 PBS series Greeks: Crucible of Civilization. It is located in Nashville, Tennessee, which is known as the Athens of the South. It has been the site of many famous events, including the opening of the U.S. Open tennis tournament and the opening ceremony of the World Series of Poker. The ParthenON was also the location of the final game of the 2004 Wimbledon tennis tournament, which was won by Roger Federer by a margin of 2-1. It can be seen in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. and in the Museum of American Art in New York City. A full-scale replica of the ParthenOn can be found in Cashville, Tennessee in the United States, which has a statue of Athena at the center of the building. It will also be the subject of a documentary about the history and culture of the city, which will be shown in the spring of 2015. It's also been the scene of many other notable events, such as the filming of the film The Godfather: Part II, in which it was used as the backdrop for a scene of the assassination of King George III by Generalissimo Charles deeded to his son Charles III. In 1965, Malaysia expelled Singapore from the Federation of Malaya, leading to the independence of Singapore. The People's Action Party (PAP) won the first election in Singapore after the merger. The union, however, was unstable due to distrust and ideological differences between leaders of the State of Singapore and the federal government of Malaysia. There were also major racial riots that year involving the majority Chinese community and the Malay community in Singapore. In particular, despite the Malaysian government conceding citizenship to the many Chinese immigrants after independence, in Singapore the Chinese disdained the Federal policies of affirmative action. Malaysia and Singapore had disagreements on the economic front. Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore did not extend to Sabah and Sarawak the full extent of the loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states. The situation escalated to such an intensity that talks soon broke down and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides. The Parliament voted 126–0 in favor of the expulsion of Singapore, with Members of Parliament from Singapore not present. On that day, a tearful Lee announced that Singapore was a sovereign, independent nation and assumed the role of Prime Minister of the new nation. The Malaya and British Borneo dollar remained legal tender until the introduction of the Singapore dollar in 1967. Before the currency split, there were discussions about a common currency between the Malaysian and Singaporean Governments. There are two heptathlons – the women's and the men's – composed of different events. The men's heptathlon is older and is held indoors, while the women’s is held outdoors and was intr intr. The name derives from the Greek hepta (seven) and athlon (contest). A competitor in a heptATHlete is referred to as aheptathlete. The word Malaysia means ""people connected by geography, economics, and ties of kinship...."" It is also the name of Malaysia's first prime minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, and the country's first president, Mahathir Mohamad, both of whom were born in Malaysia. The country is separated from Singapore by the Johor Strait, which is also known as the ""Malaysian Straits"" The country's name is derived from the Latin word ""malay"" which means ""the land"" or ""the people"" and refers to the Malays' desire to be part of a single nation. It is the only country in the world that has been known to have a black president, Abdul Hadi Awang. duced in the 1980s, first appearing in the Olympics in 1984. Jessica Ennis-Hill, representing Great Britain, is the 2012 Olympic Gold Medallist and the current World Champion. There is also a Tetradecathlon, which is a double heptathlon, consisting of 14 events, seven events per day. In each event, the athlete scores points for his/her performance in each event according to scoring tables issued by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) The athlete accumulating the highest number of points wins the competition. The scoring is similar for both versions. The heptathlete scoring system was devised by Dr Karl Ulbrich, a Viennese mathematician. The events are split into three groups, and the scores are calculated according to the three formulae: running events (200 m, 800 m and 100 m), high jump and javelin throw. Each event also has a minimum recordable performance level (e.g. 0.75 m for the high jump), corresponding to zero points. The following table shows the minimum benchmark levels required to earn 1000 points inEach event of the Heptathlon. The IAAF World Combined Events Challenge determines a yearly women's heptethathlete champion. It is the men's combined event in the IAAFWorld Indoor Championships in Athletics. The other version is an indoor competition, normally contested by men only. The women's outdoor heptaths consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day and the remaining three on day two: 100 metres hurdles, high jump, shot put, 800m and 800m. The men's indoor heptarthathlete consists of  60 metres hurdles, 60 metres long jump, 100m hurdles, long jump and pole vault. The winner of each event is declared the winner of the competition, and is known as the ""champion"" or ""champ"" The winner is announced at the end of the second day of the tournament. The final is held on the third day, and it is decided by a points-scoring system to determine the overall winner. The winning athlete is then announced as the champion of the event, as well as the runner-up and third-place finisher in the women's indoor and outdoor competitions. The overall winner is named the ""Champion"" and is announced on the fourth day. The champion is announced the next day, the day after the final, and so on.

Units of Measurement
A Dictionary of Units of Measurement
For information on a specific unit, click on the first          letter of its name:
Answers to the three most frequently asked          questions:
How many micrograms (µg, ug or mcg) in a          milligram (mg)?
1000 micrograms = 1 milligram, and 1000 milligrams = 1          gram.
How can I convert from international units (IU)          to milligrams or micrograms?
Generally speaking, you can't. IU's measure the potency of a          drug, not its mass or weight.
What countries besides the U.S. have not adopted the          metric system?
Many U.S. teachers think the answer is ""Liberia and          Burma"" (make that Myanmar). Let's give Liberia and Myanmar a          break! All countries have adopted the metric system,          including the U.S., and most countries (but not the U.S.)          have taken steps to eliminate most uses of traditional          measurements. However, in nearly all countries people still          use traditional units sometimes, at least in colloquial          expressions. Becoming metric is not a one-time event that          has either happened or not. It is a process that happens          over time. Every country is somewhere in this process of          going metric, some much further along than others.
Commentary and Explanation
Wire gauge table             (U.S./U.K.)
Introduction
Americans probably use a greater variety of units of measurement than anyone else in the world. Caught in a slow-moving transition from customary to metric units, we employ a fascinating and sometimes frustrating mixture of units in talking about the same things. We measure the length of a race in meters, but the length of the long jump event in feet and inches. We speak of an engine's power in horsepower and its displacement in liters. In the same dispatch, we describe a hurricane's wind speed in knots and its central pressure in millibars.
Furthermore, our English customary units do not form a consistent system. Reflecting their diverse roots in Celtic, Roman, Saxon, and Norse cultures, they are often confusing and contradictory. There are two systems for land measurement (one based on the yard and the other on the rod) and a third system for distances at sea. There are two systems (avoirdupois and troy) for small weights and two more (based on the long and short tons) for large weights. Americans use two systems for volumes (one for dry commodities and one for liquids) and the British use a third (British Imperial Measure).
Meanwhile, only a few Americans know that the legal definitions of the English customary units are actually based on metric units. The U. S. and British governments have agreed that a yard equals exactly 0.9144 meter and an avoirdupois pound equals exactly 0.453 592 37 kilograms. In this way, all the units of measurement Americans use every day are based on the standards of the metric system . Since 1875, in fact, the United States has subscribed to the International System of Weights and Measures , the official version of the metric system.
This dictionary began as a collection of notes describing the relationship between various English and metric units. It gradually grew until it finally became too large a word-processing document; I couldn't find my way around in it any more. So I turned it into a folder of html documents and added it to my Internet site. For many months, no one looked at the site except me and my students. Then, gradually, the dictionary began to attract users from around the world. Many users were kind enough to point out errors; others suggested additions and improvements. Questions about units began to appear in my email inbox. Sometimes I could answer the questions, sometimes not.
Today the dictionary has become a kind of interactive resource. It grows slowly and steadily, mostly through suggestions from readers and my efforts to answer questions posed by readers. You can participate in this process! Please let me know if you find any errors on the site, or if you can't find what you wanted to know, or if you know of units used in your field of study or in your part of the world that aren't included.
I hope you find the dictionary useful and informative.

Passage:
Arthur Askey
Arthur Bowden Askey, CBE (6 June 190016 November 1982) was an English comedian and actor. Askey's humour owed much to the playfulness of the characters he portrayed, his improvisation, and his use of catchphrases, which included ""Hello playmates!"", ""I thank you"" (pronounced ""Ay-Thang-Yaw""), and ""Before your very eyes"".

Early life and education 

Askey was born at 29 Moses Street, Dingle, Liverpool, the eldest child and only son of Samuel Askey (d. 1958), secretary of the firm Sugar Products of Liverpool, and his wife, Betsy Bowden (d. 1949), of Knutsford, Cheshire. Six months after his birth the family moved to 90 Rosslyn Street, Liverpool. Askey was educated at St. Michael's Council School (1905–11) and the Liverpool Institute for Boys (1911–16).  He was small in stature at 5' 2"" (1.58 m), with a breezy, smiling personality, and wore distinctive horn-rimmed glasses.

Career

He served in the armed forces in World War I and performed in army entertainments. 
After working as a clerk for Liverpool Corporation, Education Department, he was in a touring concert party and the music halls, but he rose to stardom in 1938 through his role in the first regular radio comedy series, Band Waggon on the BBC. 
Band Waggon began as a variety show, but had been unsuccessful until Askey and his partner, Richard Murdoch, took on a larger role in the writing. 
During the broadcasting of Band Wagon they attempted to advertise a scouring powder with the chant of ""Askeytoff will take it off"" with the result that an announcer came on and shut the show down as advertising was strictly prohibited on the BBC  

Film roles

During the Second World War Askey starred in several Gainsborough Pictures comedy films, including Band Waggon (1940), based on the radio show; Charley's (Big-Hearted) Aunt (1940); The Ghost Train (1941); I Thank You (1941); Back Room Boy (1942);  King Arthur Was a Gentleman (1942); Miss London Ltd. (1943) and Bees in Paradise (1944). His last film was Rosie Dixon - Night Nurse (1978), starring Debbie Ash. 

Television

In the early 1930s Askey appeared on an early form of BBC television — the spinning disc invented by John Logie Baird that scanned vertically and had only thirty lines. Askey had to be heavily made up for his face to be recognisable at such low resolution. When television became electronic, with 405 horizontal lines, Askey was a regular performer in variety shows.

When television returned after World War II, he made the transition well. His first TV series was Before Your Very Eyes! (1952), named after his catchphrase. On 3 May 1956 Askey presented Meet The People, a launch night programme for Granada Television. In 1957 writers Sid Colin and Talbot Rothwell revived the Band Waggon format for Living It Up, a series that reunited Askey and Murdoch after 18 years. He continued to appear frequently on television in the 1970s, notably as a panellist on the ITV talent show New Faces, where his usually sympathetic comments would offset the harsher judgments of fellow judges Tony Hatch and Mickie Most. He also appeared on the comedy panel game Jokers Wild.

During the 1950s and '60s, he appeared in many sitcoms, including Love and Kisses, Arthur's Treasured Volumes and The Arthur Askey Show. He was the subject of This Is Your Life on two occasions, in December 1959 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews, and in December 1974, when Andrews, dressed as Humpty Dumpty, surprised him on a television show while discussing the art of pantomime.

Theatre

He appeared in the popular West End musical Follow the Girls.  He also made many stage appearances as a pantomime dame.

Recordings

His recording career included ""The Bee Song"", which was an integral part of his stage and television act for many years, ""The Thing-Ummy Bob""  and his theme tune, ""Big-Hearted Arthur"" (which was also his nickname). In 1941 a song he intended to record, ""It's Really Nice to See You Mr Hess""The song is alternatively known as ""Thanks for Dropping in Mr Hess"" (after Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess fled to Scotland), was banned by the War Office. A collection of Askey's wartime recordings appear on the CD album Band Waggon/Big Hearted Arthur Goes To War.

Private Eye

Private Eye magazine in the 1970s regularly made the comment that he and the Queen Mother had ""never been seen in the same room together"", referring to the fact that they were about the same age and height and suggesting that the Queen Mother was Askey in drag.

Honours

He was awarded the OBE in 1969 and the CBE in 1981.

Personal life

He was married to Elizabeth May Swash in 1925 until her death in 1974; he was the father of actress Anthea Askey (1933-1999). 

Death

Askey carried on working until just before he was hospitalised in July 1982 due to poor circulation which resulted in gangrene and the amputation of both legs.[http://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/17/obituaries/arthur-askey-comic-of-british-stage-and-tv.html Arthur Askey New York Times Obituary]. Retrieved 20 April 2014 He died in London's St Thomas's Hospital on 16 November 1982 and is buried in Putney Vale Cemetery.

The Big Issue
The Big Issue is a street newspaper founded by John Bird and Gordon Roddick in September 1991 and published in four continents. It is written by professional journalists and sold by homeless individuals. The Big Issue is one of the UK's leading social businesses and exists to offer homeless people, or individuals at risk of homelessness, the opportunity to earn a legitimate income, thereby helping them to reintegrate into mainstream society. It is the world's most widely circulated street newspaper.

History

Inspired by Street News, a newspaper sold by homeless people in New York, The Big Issue was founded in 1991 by John Bird and Gordon Roddick as a response to the increasing numbers of homeless people in London;  they have been friends since 1967.  The Body Shop provided start-up capital to the equivalent value of $50,000.  The magazine was initially published monthly; but, in June 1993, The Big Issue went weekly. The venture continued to expand with national editions being established in Scotland and Wales, as well as regional editions for Northern England and England's South West Region. Further editions are also produced in seven locations overseas.

In 1995, The Big Issue Foundation was founded to offer additional support and advice to vendors around issues such as housing, health, personal finance and addiction.

In 2001, the magazine sold nearly 300,000 copies. Between 2007 and 2011, the circulation of The Big Issue declined from 167,000 to less than 125,000. Competition between vendors also increased at this time. In January 2012, the magazine was relaunched, with an increased focus on campaigning and political journalism. New columnists were added, including the Premier League footballer Joey Barton, Rachel Johnson and Samira Ahmed. The cover price was increased. 

Vendors 

To become a vendor, one must be homeless, vulnerably housed or marginalised in some way. The Big Issue recognises, however, that for many people, being housed is only the first stage in getting off the streets; therefore, The Big Issue Foundation exists to support vendors in gaining control of their lives by tackling the various issues which lead to homelessness.

There are five localised editions of the magazine sold throughout the United Kingdom and vendors buy The Big Issue for £1.25  and sell it for £2.50. The magazine is also produced and sold in Australia, Ireland, South Korea, South Africa, Japan, Namibia, Kenya, Malawi and Taiwan. All vendors receive training, sign a code of conduct  and can be identified by badges which include their photo and vendor number.

Migration 

The accession of several Central and Eastern European countries to the European Union in 2004 led to the increased migration to the UK of residents of those countries. When Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007, the right of their residents (termed ""A2 nationals"") to work in Britain was limited to the self-employed, highly skilled migrants, and food and agricultural workers.  The Big Issue, whose vendors are classed as self-employed, offers an opportunity for A2 migrants to work in the UK. By 2011, around half of Big Issue sellers in the north of England were of Romani origin, many of whom having migrated from Romania and Bulgaria.  In London, 30% of rough sleepers are Eastern European.  In 2012, a Romanian Big Issue vendor obtained a court ruling which confirmed that she is entitled, as a self-employed person, to receive housing benefit.  The Big Issue has been criticised for enabling migrants to access the benefits system in this way.  The magazine responded by asserting its role in reducing benefit dependency, highlighting British Prime Minister David Cameron's description of it as 'a fantastic example of how we can reduce dependence on state hand-outs'. 

Ethos

The magazine is produced by The Big Issue Company Ltd. The company is a self-sustaining business which generates income through magazine sales and advertising revenues. Financially, The Big Issue is a not-for-profit organisation, with all post-investment profits passed to The Big Issue Foundation (legally a separate entity). The Big Issue Foundation is the registered charity arm of the organisation. It aims to underpin the company's work by tackling the underlying causes of homelessness.

Overseas projects

There are nine Big Issue projects by the same name in other nations.
* The Big Issue Australia (From June 1996) 
* The Big Issue Japan (From November 2003) 
* The Big Issue Kenya (From 2007) 
* The Big Issue Korea (From July 2010) 
* The Big Issue Malawi (From 2009) 
* The Big Issue Namibia  
* The Big Issue The Republic of Ireland  
* The Big Issue South Africa (From December 1996) 
* The Big Issue Taiwan (From April 2010) 
* The Big Issue Zambia (From 2007)  

Criticism

The Big Issue has been the centre of much controversy among publishers of street newspapers, mainly because of its business model.  Publishers of some other street newspapers, especially in the United States, have criticised it for being overly ""commercial"" and having a flashy design. According to these critics, street newspapers ought to focus on covering political and social issues that affect the homeless, rather than emulating mainstream newspapers to generate a profit.  Publishers of some smaller papers, such as Making Change in Santa Monica, California, said they felt threatened when The Big Issue began to publish in their area. Other papers have also criticised The Big Issue for its professional production and limited participation by homeless individuals in writing and producing the newspaper.  Others, however, have stated that The Big Issue uses a successful business model to generate a profit to benefit the homeless, and its founder John Bird has said that it is ""possible to be both profitable and ethically correct.""

Passage:
Pannier
A pannier is a basket, bag, box, or similar container, carried in pairs either slung over the back of a beast of burden, or attached to the sides of a bicycle or motorcycle. The term derives from a Middle English borrowing of the Old French panier, meaning 'bread basket'. 

Animal panniers

Traditional panniers for animal transport are typically made of canvas, leather, or wicker. Modern panniers may be rectangular boxes of hard-sided plastic. Panniers are loaded in such a manner as to distribute weight evenly on either side of the animal. For horse packing, and when carrying particularly heavy loads on other animals they are supported by a pack saddle to distribute weight more evenly across the back of the animal. In some cases, additional items are placed on the back of the animal, between the panniers.

Bicycle panniers

There are many styles of bicycle panniers. Touring panniers are usually sold in pairs, intended to hold enough equipment for self-sustained tours over days or weeks. The most common setup is to use a pair of smaller panniers (10 to 15 liters each) mounted on a low rider and a pair of larger ones on the rear carrier (20 to 30 liters each).

Commuters who bicycle have pannier options designed to hold laptop computers, files and folders, changes of clothes or shoes and lunches. Since the movement against disposable shopping bags emerged, many panniers are made easily detachable from the bike, to allow using them for shopping bags. Some cyclists create makeshift pannier bags out of grocery bags, grocery baskets, garment-bags, convertible backpacks, and various multi-purpose bags as alternatives to purchasing a commercial pannier.

The first panniers designed specifically for bicycles were patented by John B. Wood of Camden, NJ, in 1884.   The modern bicycle pannier was invented by Hartley Alley (1919-2001) of Boulder, CO, in 1971.   Alley also designed a handlebar bag and other bicycle luggage that he manufactured and sold under the Touring Cyclist brand in the 1970s until his retirement in 1984.

Construction

Bicycle panniers are usually made of nylon or other synthetic fabric which can be stitched, or in the case of waterproof panniers; welded together.

As bicycles are often ridden in the rain, many panniers are built to be water-repellent or waterproof by themselves. Others include built-in rain-covers, or rain-covers are offered as accessories. The shape of the pannier may be enforced by a frame or stiffening panel made of plastic or metal to help keep it in place and prevent it from contacting a wheel.

Panniers are usually built to attach to a rear rack or front rack already fitted to the bicycle. Removable panniers hook onto the top edge of the rack and are often held in place by a latch or elastic mechanism.

Motorcycle panniers

Motorcycle panniers are generally hard box containers with lids, made of metal or hard plastic. The panniers may be permanently fixed to the motorcycle or may be removable. Soft cases may be leather or fabric usually without permanent mountings and are often called saddlebags or 'throwovers'.
Question:
The term pannier (e.g., motorbike side-box) derives from what sort of basket?
Answer:
Somun
Passage:
James Grieve apple
James Grieve is an old variety of apple. It gets its name from its breeder, James Grieve, who raised the apple from pollination of a Pott's Seedling or a Cox's Orange Pippin apple in Edinburgh, Scotland some time before 1893. 

This is a savoury, juicy apple with strong acidity at first, which then mellows as the fruit matures during September, but the flesh softens soon thereafter. When picked early, it makes a sweet and delicate stewed apple, but then can be used as a dessert apple. 
James Grieve apples used to be grown all over Europe and were delivered to the city markets via train or horse-and-cart, but because they bruised easily they had to be carefully packed in laundry-type wicker baskets filled with straw. The fruit cannot sustain modern supermarket handling, and so they are now only grown in gardens and for direct sale to consumers. Nonetheless, James Grieve is considered a good apple because it is exceptionally tasty, it produces fruit every year, it is disease-resistant, and it is a good pollenizer for other apples. It may drop early in warm weather. It is also a good apple for making apple juice.

Passage:
Allinson
Allinson is a brand of bread and of flour made by Allied Bakeries being owned by Associated British Foods

History

Dr Thomas Allinson was born in the Hulme district of Manchester in 1858. He trained as a medical doctor in Edinburgh, graduating in 1879. He founded the first Allinson mill in 1892 in Bethnal Green as Dr Allinson's Natural Food Company. It was the first to produce wholemeal/wholegrain flour. His slogan was Health without Medicine. Allinson was viewed as an eccentric because of his advocation of vegetarianism (in particular of wholegrain bread) and opposition to many medical practices of the time. Two more mills were bought in Castleford and Newport in Wales.

The company was joined with six others to form Allied Bakeries by Willard Garfield Weston in 1935.

The company has advertised on TV with Brian Glover declaring it's Bread wi' Nowt Taken Out. It gave the impression that Thomas Allinson would have had a Yorkshire accent, but that would not have been the case.

Production

The company is based in Maidenhead in Berkshire, at the same address as ABF. It only makes wholemeal bread (not brown bread). The brand is worth around £20m. It sells two varieties: Wholemeal and Hi-Bran.

Allinson Flour

Allinson Flour  is a separate company making flour and yeast, owned by The Silver Spoon Company  based in Peterborough.
Question:
Which brand of bread was advertised with the slogan 'Bread with nowt taken out'?
Answer:
ALLINSON'S
Passage:
Member of Congress
A Member of Congress (MC) is a person who has been appointed or elected and inducted into an official body called a congress, typically to represent a particular constituency in a legislature. Member of Parliament (MP) is an equivalent term in other jurisdictions.

United States

In referring to a lawmaker in their capacity of serving in Congress the term Member of Congress is used less often than other terms in the United States. This is because in the United States the word Congress is used as a descriptive term for the collective body of legislators, from both houses of its bicameral federal legislature, the Senate and the House of Representatives. For this reason, and in order to distinguish who is a member of which house, a member of the Senate is typically referred to as Senator (Senator ""name"" from ""state""), and a member of the House of Representatives is usually referred to as Congressman (Congressman ""name"" from the ""number"" district of ""state""), or Representative (Representative ""name"" from the ""number"" district of ""state"").

Members of Congress in both houses are elected by direct popular vote. Senators are elected via a statewide vote and representatives by voters in each congressional district. Congressional districts are apportioned to the states, once every ten years, based on population figures from the most recent nationwide census. Each of the 435 members of the House of Representatives is elected to serve a two-year term representing the people of his district.  Each state, regardless of its size, has at least one congressman. Each of the 100 members of the Senate is elected to serve a six-year term representing the people of his state. Each state, regardless of its size, has two senators. Senatorial terms are staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Each staggered group of one-third of the senators is called a 'class'. No state has both its senators in the same class. 

History of the United States Congress

The United States Congress was created in Article I of the Constitution, where the Founding Fathers laid out the limitations and powers of Congress. Article I grants Congress legislative power and lists the enumerated powers and allows Congress to make laws that are necessary and proper to carry out the enumerated powers. It specifies the election and composition of the House of Representatives and Senate and the qualifications necessary to serve in each chamber.

The Seventeenth Amendment changed how senators were elected. Originally, senators were elected by state legislatures. The Seventeenth Amendment changed this to senators being elected directly by popular vote.
Question:
How many members are there in the US lower house, the House of Representatives?
Answer:
435
Passage:
Treaty of Brussels
The Treaty of Brussels was signed on 17 March 1948 between Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, as an expansion to the preceding year's defence pledge, the Dunkirk Treaty signed between Britain and France. As the Treaty of Brussels contained a mutual defence clause, it provided a basis upon which the 1954 Paris Conference established the Western European Union (WEU). It was terminated on 31 March 2010.

Background

The Treaty was intended to provide western Europe with a bulwark against the communist threat and to bring greater collective security. The Pact had cultural and social clauses, and concepts for the setting up of a 'Consultative Council'. The basis for this was that a cooperation between Western nations would help stop the spread of Communism.

In that it was an effort towards European post-war security cooperation, the Brussels Pact was a precursor to NATO and similar to it in the sense that it promised European mutual defence. However, it greatly differed from NATO in that it envisaged a purely European mutual defence pact primarily against Germany, whereas NATO took shape the next year, on the recognition that Europe was unavoidably divided into two opposing blocks (western and communist), that the USSR was a much greater threat than the possibility of a resurgent Germany, and that western European mutual defence would have to be atlanticist (i.e. including North America).

In September 1948, the parties to the Treaty of Brussels decided to create a military agency under the name of the Western Union Defence Organization. It consisted of a WU Defence Committee at Prime Ministerial level, and a WU Combined Chiefs of Staff committee, including all the national chiefs of staff, which would direct the operative organisation. 
Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (UK) was appointed permanent Chairman of the Land, Naval and Air Commanders-in-Committee, with headquarters in Fontainebleau, France. The nominated commanders-in-chief were General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny (France) as C-in-C, Land Forces, Air Chief Marshal Sir James Robb (UK) as C-in-C, Air Forces, and Vice-Admiral Robert Jaujard (France) for the Navy, as Flag Officer Western Europe.  Volume 3 of Nigel Hamilton's Life of Montgomery of Alamein gives a good account of the disagreements between Montgomery and de Lattre which caused much ill-feeling in the headquarters.

Trying to avoid the need for West German rearmament, a treaty aimed at establishing a European Defence Community was signed by the six ECSC members in May 1952 but failed when it was rejected by the French National Assembly in August 1954. This rejection led to the London and Paris Conferences in September and October, with the conclusion that he Treaty of Brussels was amended by the Protocol signed in Paris on 23 October 1954, which added West Germany and Italy to the Western Union Defence Organization. On this occasion it was renamed the Western European Union.

Signing ceremony

The Treaty was signed by the following plenipotentiaries:
* Prince Charles of Belgium, as the reigning Prince Regent of Belgium
* Vincent Auriol, President of France 
* Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg
* Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands
* King George VI of the United Kingdom
* Paul-Henri Spaak, Prime Minister of Belgium
* Georges Bidault, French Minister of Foreign Affairs
* Joseph Bech, Luxembourgish Minister of Foreign Affairs
* Gaston Eyskens, Belgian Minister of Finance
* Carel Godfried Willem Hendrik baron van Boetzelaer van Oosterhout, Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs
* Ernest Bevin, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom
* Jean de Hautecloque, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the French Republic in Brussels
* Robert Als, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Luxembourg in Brussels
* Baron Binnert Philip van Harinxma thoe Slooten, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Netherlands in Brussels
* George William Rendel, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty in Brussels

Reform and abolition

NATO

When the division of Europe into two opposing camps became unavoidable, the threat of the USSR and Eastern Bloc became much more important than the threat of German rearmament.

Western Europe therefore sought a new mutual defence pact involving the United States, a powerful military force for such an alliance. The United States, concerned with containing the influence of the USSR, was responsive to this idea.

There was therefore rapid progress on this idea, and secret meetings had already begun by the end of March, where American, Canadian and British officials negotiated over the concept.  Eventually, it would lead to the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation by the North Atlantic Treaty signed in Washington DC in 1949. The Western Union Defence Organization structure was absorbed into NATO from December 1950 to April 1951.  NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe took over the WUDO's defence role.

Paris Agreements

In 1954 West Germany and Italy were invited to join the pact, and accordingly the Brussels Treaty was modified. The Western European Union was established.

Lisbon Treaty

In 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon took over the WEU's mutual defence clause. After the discussion the ten member states decided to terminate the Treaty of Brussels on 31 March 2010. The activities of WEU were terminated by June 2011.

Minster Way
The Minster Way is a 50 mi walking route between the Minsters of Beverley and York. It crosses the chalk hills of the Yorkshire Wolds, as well as a wide variety of the East Riding of Yorkshire countryside. Part of the route follows the Yorkshire Wolds Way National Trail across Sylvan Dale before diverting to Millington, Bishop Wilton and Stamford Bridge, where it follows the River Derwent into the Plain of York as far as the River Ouse.

The Minster Way links to other paths, namely the Beverley Twenty; Blackpool to Bridlington (Aerospace Way); Chalkland Way; East Riding Heritage Way; Jorvic Way; Trans Pennine Trail; Wilberforce Way and the Yorkshire Wolds Way National Trail. 

History

It was established in 1980 by Ray Wallis of the East Yorkshire Area of The Ramblers. The route is waymarked by white symbols depicting a view of an ecclesiastical building representing the two minsters and the words Minster Way. A badge was created by the founder of the walk for hikers to display as proof of completion of the walk. It is similar to the waymarks, except the picture and words are in yellow on a red background. 

Settlements on walk

The route passes through the following towns and villages in order from the start point: 

* Beverley
* Scorborough
* Lockington
* Kilnwick

Passage:
Badjelly the Witch
Badjelly the Witch is a brief handwritten, illustrated story by Spike Milligan, created for his children, then printed in 1973. It was made into an audio and a video version.

In the story, two children Tim and Rose, looking for their lost cow Lucy, meet magical enchanted forest characters. They are captured by Badjelly the witch, then rescued by an eagle. God intervenes as they escape, and the witch is destroyed when she attempts to ""scratch God's eye out"". The characters enchanted by Badjelly are rescued.

In 1975, in the planning for an audio version for the BBC ""infant's programme"" Let's Join In, Milligan objected to the planned removal of God from the story. The BBC wrote in a letter that the object is not to put God on the same level as goblins, to which Milligan replied that goblins, fairies and God all exist. However, he allowed God to be removed. 

In 1974 Ed Welch set Badjelly the Witch to music and the LP was released on Polydor Records. Milligan narrated it with a large orchestra, and the LP was a reasonable success. In New Zealand, where it was regularly played on morning radio, it was a huge success and has sold over 40000 recordings up to 2012.

Film

CBBC and Ragdoll Productions had collaborated on a film based on this novel in December 2000. Spike Milligan, the book's writer, narrated the movie.

Theatre

In 2010 and 2016 Tim Bray Productions presented its version of 'Badjelly the Witch' on stage at The PumpHouse Theatre, Takapuna, Auckland, New Zealand. Tim Bray adapted and directed the book into a stage play and included The Goons' 'Ying Tong' song along with Monty Pythonesque comedy. The script is available through Playmarket, New Zealand's script agency. Both seasons were hugely successful. 

In 2010/11, there was a production created by the Chickenshed Theatre Company called Badjelly's Bad Christmas, with Badjelly the Witch, along with many other characters created by Milligan such as Sir Nobonk and King Twytt, as the main characters.

The show was performed for a season during 2006 for the New Theatre, Sydney. The show was directed by Rosane McNamara, and featured actors Vanessa Caswill, Jodine Muir, David Walker and Richie Black.

Passage:
Victory in Europe Day
Victory in Europe Day, generally known as V-E Day, VE Day or simply V Day was the public holiday celebrated on 8 May 1945 (7 May in Commonwealth realms) to mark the formal acceptance by the Allies of World War II of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender of its armed forces.  It thus marked the end of World War II in Europe.

The term VE Day existed as early as September 1944,  in anticipation of victory.  On 30 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader, committed suicide during the Battle of Berlin. Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorised by his successor, Reichspräsident Karl Dönitz. The administration headed by Dönitz was known as the Flensburg Government. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France and on 8 May in Berlin, Germany.

The former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries have historically celebrated the end of World War II on 9 May. However, the Baltic countries now commemorate VE day on 8 May.  In Ukraine from 2015, 8 May was designated as a day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, but it is not a public holiday. 

Celebrations 

Upon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the world. From Moscow to Los Angeles, people celebrated.
In the United Kingdom, more than one million people celebrated in the streets to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations. 

In the United States, the victory happened on President Harry Truman's 61st birthday. He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April.  Flags remained at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period.   Truman said of dedicating the victory to Roosevelt's memory and keeping the flags at half-staff that his only wish was ""that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day."" Later that day, Truman said that the victory made it his most enjoyable birthday. 

Massive celebrations also took place in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and especially in New York's Times Square. 

Soviet Victory Day 

As the Soviet representative in Reims had no authority to sign the German instrument of surrender, the Soviet leadership proposed to consider Reims surrender as a ""preliminary"" act. The surrender ceremony was repeated in Berlin on 8 May, where the instrument of surrender was signed by supreme German military commander Wilhelm Keitel, by Georgy Zhukov and Allied representatives. Since the Soviet Union was to the east of Germany, it was 9 May Moscow time when the German military surrender became effective, which is why Russia and most of the former Soviet republics commemorate Victory Day on 9 May instead of 8 May.

Commemorative public holidays 

(May 8 unless otherwise stated)
* Italy (25 April) ""Festa della Liberazione"" (Liberation Holiday).
* Denmark (5 May) as ""Befrielsen"" (The Liberation)
* Netherlands (5 May) as ""Bevrijdingsdag"" (Liberation Day)
* United Kingdom: In 1995 the May Day bank holiday was moved from the first Monday in May, 1 May, to Monday 8 May, for that year only, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War.
*East Germany as Tag der Befreiung (Day of Liberation), a public holiday from 1950 to 1966 and in 1985. Between 1975 and 1990, as Tag des Sieges (Victory Day (9 May)).
* France as Victoire 1945
* Slovakia as Deň víťazstva nad fašizmom (Victory over Fascism Day) 
* Czech Republic as Den vítězství (Day of Victory) or Den osvobození (Day of Liberation)

Wilfred Baddeley
Wilfred Baddeley (11 January 1872, Bromley, England – 24 January 1929, Menton, France) was a former World No. 1 British male tennis player and the elder of the Baddeley twins. His brother Herbert died on 20 July 1931 in Cannes, France.

His 6–4, 1–6, 7–5, 6–0 win over Joshua Pim in 1891 at the age of 19 years and five months made him, until Boris Becker in 1985, the youngest men's singles champion at Wimbledon.  He was also runner-up in 1893, 1894 and 1896. With Herbert, he won four doubles championships at Wimbledon in 1891, 1894 – 1896.

Thelwall Viaduct
The Thelwall Viaduct () is a steel composite girder viaduct in Lymm, Warrington, England. It carries the M6 motorway across the Manchester Ship Canal and the River Mersey. Its location on the motorway network is between junctions 20 and 21 of the M6, the former being also known as junction 9 of the M56.

It actually comprises two entirely separate bridges, one of 4,414 feet long carrying the northbound carriageway, which was the longest motorway bridge in England when it was opened in July 1963, and one 4,500 feet long carrying the southbound carriageway which was opened in 1995.  The longest single span is the one of 336 feet crossing the ship canal.

In July 2002 a failed roller bearing was discovered and it became necessary to close all but one northbound lane. As the M6 at the time carried an estimated 150,000–160,000 vehicles per day, this led to serious congestion.  The viaduct was not completely reopened to daytime traffic until February 2005, and subsequently remained partially closed at night for further remedial work to take place.  In all, 148 bearings were replaced, with the repair scheme costing around £52 million.

Given the bridge's height and openness to the elements it has frequently been the subject of speed reductions due to strong gusts of wind that badly affect the stability of high-sided vehicles. On several occasions lane closures have resulted as a consequence of articulated vehicles simply being blown over. However, the open sides of the bridge are a deliberate design feature to reduce the likelihood of snow drifts building on the carriageways.

In April 2011 a massive Freeparty took place under the bridge, with reportedly over 5,000 ravers in attendance. 

1971 Accident

At approximately 8am on 13 September 1971 thick fog led to a catastrophic multiple vehicle crash on the viaduct. More than 200 cars, trucks and tankers piled up, five vehicles burst into flames, 10 people were killed and 70 injured. It was the worst accident ever recorded on British roads at that time.

The Divine Miss M
The Divine Miss M is the debut studio album by American singer and actress Bette Midler, released in 1972 on the Atlantic Records label. The title of the album refers to Midler's famous stage persona.

The album was co-produced by Barry Manilow, and includes several songs that since have become repertoire standards, such as ""Do You Want to Dance?"", ""Chapel of Love"", ""Hello In There"", ""Friends"" and ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"".

The Divine Miss M reached the Top Ten on Billboards album chart and was later awarded a Platinum Disc by the RIAA. In 1973, the album won Midler a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. ""Do You Want to Dance?"", ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"" and ""Friends"" were all Top 40 hit singles from the album, with ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"" climbing to #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reaching #1 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart.

The album was released on CD for the first time in 1990. A remastered version of the album was released by Atlantic Records/Warner Music in 1995.

Passage:
Organ (anatomy)
In biology, an organ or viscus is a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to serve a common function.  In anatomy, a viscus is an internal organ, and viscera is the plural form.   

Organs are composed of main tissue, parenchyma, and ""sporadic"" tissues, stroma. The main tissue is that which is unique for the specific organ, such as the myocardium, the main tissue of the heart, while sporadic tissues include the nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissues. Functionally related organs often cooperate to form whole organ systems. Organs exist in all higher biological organisms, in particular they are not restricted to animals, but can also be identified in plants. In single-cell organisms like bacteria, the functional analogue of an organ is called organelle. 

A hollow organ is a visceral organ that forms a hollow tube or pouch, such as the stomach or intestine, or that includes a cavity, like the heart or urinary bladder.

Organ systems 

Two or more organs working together in the execution of a specific body function form an organ system, also called a biological system or body system. The functions of organ systems often share significant overlap. For instance, the nervous and endocrine system both operate via a shared organ, the hypothalamus. For this reason, the two systems are combined and studied as the neuroendocrine system. The same is true for the musculoskeletal system because of the relationship between the muscular and skeletal systems.

Mammals such as humans have a variety of organ systems. These specific systems are also widely studied in human anatomy.
* Cardiovascular system: pumping and channeling blood to and from the body and lungs with heart, blood and blood vessels.
* Digestive system: digestion and processing food with salivary glands, esophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, intestines, colon, rectum and anus.
* Endocrine system: communication within the body using hormones made by endocrine glands such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, pineal body or pineal gland, thyroid, parathyroids and adrenals, i.e., adrenal glands.
* Excretory system: kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra involved in fluid balance, electrolyte balance and excretion of urine.
* Lymphatic system: structures involved in the transfer of lymph between tissues and the blood stream, the lymph and the nodes and vessels that transport it including the Immune system: defending against disease-causing agents with leukocytes, tonsils, adenoids, thymus and spleen.
* Integumentary system: skin, hair and nails.
* Muscular system: movement with muscles.
* Nervous system: collecting, transferring and processing information with brain, spinal cord and nerves.
* Reproductive system: the sex organs, such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, mammary glands, testes, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate and penis.
* Respiratory system: the organs used for breathing, the pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs and diaphragm.
* Skeletal system: structural support and protection with bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons.

Other animals

The organ level of organisation in animals can be first detected in flatworms and the more advanced phyla. The less-advanced taxons (like Placozoa, Porifera and Radiata) do not show consolidation of their tissues into organs.

Plants

The study of plant organs is referred to as plant morphology, rather than anatomy, as in animal systems. Organs of plants can be divided into vegetative and reproductive. Vegetative plant organs are roots, stems, and leaves. The reproductive organs are variable. In flowering plants, they are represented by the flower, seed and fruit. In conifers, the organ that bears the reproductive structures is called a cone. In other divisions (phyla) of plants, the reproductive organs are called strobili, in Lycopodiophyta, or simply gametophores in mosses.

The vegetative organs are essential for maintaining the life of a plant. While there can be 11 organ systems in animals, there are far fewer in plants, where some perform the vital functions, such as photosynthesis, while the reproductive organs are essential in reproduction. However, if there is asexual vegetative reproduction, the vegetative organs are those that create the new generation of plants (see clonal colony).

History

Etymology

The English word ""organ"" derives from the Latin ', meaning ""instrument"", itself from the Greek word , ' (""implement; musical instrument; organ of the body""). The Greek word is related to , ' (""work"").Barnhart's Concise Dictionary of Etymology The viscera, when removed from a butchered animal, are known collectively as offal. Internal organs are also informally known as ""guts"" (which may also refer to the gastrointestinal tract), or more formally, ""innards"".

Aristotle used the word frequently in his philosophy, both to describe the organs of plants or animals (e.g. the roots of a tree, the heart or liver of an animal), and to describe more abstract ""parts"" of an interconnected whole (e.g. his philosophical works, taken as a whole, are referred to as the ""organon"").

The English word ""organism"" is a neologism coined in the 17th century, probably formed from the verb to organize. At first the word referred to an organization or social system. The meaning of a living animal or plant is first recorded in 1842. Plant organs are made from tissue built up from different types of tissue. When there are three or more organs it is called an organ system. 

The adjective visceral, also splanchnic, is used for anything pertaining to the internal organs. Historically, viscera of animals were examined by Roman pagan priests like the haruspices or the augurs in order to divine the future by their shape, dimensions or other factors. This practice remains an important ritual in some remote, tribal societies.

The term ""visceral"" is contrasted with the term """", meaning ""of or relating to the wall of a body part, organ or cavity"". The two terms are often used in describing a membrane or piece of connective tissue, referring to the opposing sides.

Passage:
Language game
A language game (also called secret language or ludling or argot) is a system of manipulating spoken words to render them incomprehensible to the untrained ear. Language games are used primarily by groups attempting to conceal their conversations from others. Some common examples are Pig Latin; the Gibberish family, prevalent in the United States and Sweden; and Verlan, spoken in France.

A common difficulty with language games is that they are usually passed down orally.
While written translations can be made, they are often imperfect, and thus spelling can vary widely.
Some factions argue that words in these spoken tongues should simply be written the way they are pronounced, while others insist that the purity of language demands that the transformation remain visible when the words are imparted to paper.

Use

Language games are primarily used by children to disguise their speech from others, which in most cases are parental figures. Some language games such as Pig Latin are so widely known that privacy is virtually impossible, as most people have a passable understanding of how it works and the words can sound very similar to their English counterpart. Although language games are not usually used in everyday conversation, some words from language games have made their way into normal speech, such as ilchay in English (from Pig Latin), and loufoque in French (from Louchébem).

Classification

One way in which language games could be organized is by language, for example, Pig Latin, Ubbi Dubbi, and Tutnese could all be in the ""English"" category, and Jeringonza could be in the ""Spanish"" category.

An alternate method of classifying language games is by their function. For example, Ubbi Dubbi, Bicycle, and :sv:Allspråket all work by inserting a code syllable before the vowel in each syllable. Therefore, these could be classified in the Gibberish family. Also, Double Talk, Língua do Pê, Jeringonza, and B-Sprache all work by adding a consonant after the vowel in each syllable, and then repeating the vowel. Thus, these could be classified in the Double Talk family. Another common type of language game is the spoonerism, in which the onsets of two words are exchanged. Using a standard word for each transformation gives another type, for example, the Finnish ""kontinkieli"", where kontti is added after each word, and spoonerism applied (kondäntti koonerismspontti koppliedäntti).

Passage:
Chelsea Headhunters
The Chelsea Headhunters were an English football hooligan firm linked to the London football club Chelsea. 

Background

There was widespread racism amongst the gang and links to various white supremacist organisations, such as Combat 18 and the National Front. The gang also became affiliated with Northern Irish loyalist paramilitary organisations, such as the Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Volunteer Force.

They were infiltrated by investigative reporter Donal MacIntyre for a documentary screened on the BBC on 9 November 1999, in which MacIntyre posed as a wannabe-member of the Chelsea Headhunters. He had a Chelsea tattoo applied to himself for authenticity, although the hardcore were surprised he chose the hated ""Millwall lion"" badge rather than the 1960s Chelsea erect lion one. He confirmed the racism in the Headhunters and their links to Combat 18, including one top-ranking member who had been imprisoned on one occasion for possession of material related to the Ku Klux Klan.  The programme led to arrests and several convictions. One member of the Headhunters, Jason Marriner who was convicted and sent to prison as a result of the show, has since written a book, ""Stitch-Up For a Blue Sole"", claiming to have been set up by MacIntyre and the BBC. He claims that footage was manipulated, 'incidents' were manufactured and they were convicted despite having no footage of them committing crimes. 

Nick Love's film The Football Factory presented the Headhunters in a fictionalized account.  The film focuses mainly on the firm's violent rivalry with the Millwall Bushwackers. Jason Marriner was the subject of a DVD release 'Jason Marriner - Football Hooligan' directed by Liam Galvin (Gangster Toy Videos).

Kevin Whitton, a high-profile member of the firm, was sentenced to life imprisonment on 8 November 1985 for violent assault after being found guilty of involvement in an attack on a pub on Kings Road. After Chelsea lost a match, Whitton and other hooligans stormed into the pub, chanting ""War! War! War!"". When they left a few minutes later, with one of them shouting, ""You bloody Americans! Coming here taking our jobs"", the bar's American manager, 29-year-old Neil Hansen, was lying on the floor, close to death.  Whitton's sentence was cut to three years on appeal on 19 May 1986.  The fan responsible for the actual assault, Wandsworth man Terence Matthews (aged 25 at the time), was arrested shortly after Whitton's conviction and remanded in custody to await trial. He was found guilty of taking part in the violence on 13 October 1986 and sentenced to four years in prison.  Matthews came to the public attention again in June 2002 when he and his 21-year-old son William received two-year prison sentences after they and another man were convicted of assaulting two police officers in Morden, Surrey. 

A more recent incident involving the Headhunters occurred on 13 February 2010, when members of the firm clashed with the Cardiff City Soul Crew at the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Stamford Bridge. On 25 March 2011, 24 people were convicted of taking part in the violence, which resulted in several people being injured (including a police officer whose jaw was broken) at Isleworth Crown Court. All of those convicted received banning orders from all football grounds in England and Wales ranging from three years to eight years. Eighteen of them received prison sentences of up to two years. 

Headhunters were involved in disturbances in Paris before a UEFA Champions League quarter final between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea on 2 April 2014. Around 300 hooligans were involved in pre-planned violence around the city, with hardcore hooligans having avoided police detection by entering France via Belgium.  

Allies 

In 2000, Chelsea Headhunters formed a temporary alliance with other British hooligans supporting Linfield F.C., Cardiff City, Swansea City and Leeds United led by Arsenal's firm, The Herd, to attack Galatasaray fans in Copenhagen and Heysel Stadium as part of revenge for the 2000 UEFA Cup semi-final stabbing of two Leeds United fans by a Galatasaray fan. Other allies were supporters of Lazio and Hellas Verona.  Chelsea Headhunters 'top boy' ('top' indicating his position within the hierarchy of the hooligan gang) Jason Marriner also appears on a photo alongside Linfield hooligan Randy Ollins in Blaney's autobiography The Undesirables with a caption by Blaney commending the Headhunters on being one of the top firms, indicating a mutual respect between the Headhunters and Manchester United's Inter City Jibbers firm.

Tokophobia – Symptoms and Facts of Tokophobia – Treatment ...
Tokophobia – Symptoms and Facts of Tokophobia – Treatment of Tokophobia
Training & Degrees
Tokophobia
Tokophobia is an extreme and uncontrollable fear of childbirth or pregnancy. While pregnancy is expected to be a time when women experience long bouts of anxiety , when they develop a fear of childbirth so intense that it disrupts their ability to lead normal lives or have a normal birth, they very likely have tokophobia.
Symptoms of Tokophobia
If left untreated, tokophobia can only become more intense and damaging. Not only can this disorder lead to an elective termination of some pregnancies because of fear, but the psychological stress attendant with the disorder can often be damaging to a pregnancy even if the woman does not elect to terminate it. Furthermore, tokophobia may only be a byproduct of other emotional and behavioral disorders such as clinical depression. Some of the more apparent indicators of tokophobia include:
Feelings of dread or panic when the idea of childbirth or pregnancy arises
Refusing to go through with childbirth unless elective Caesarean section can be guaranteed
An intense increase in anxiety or depression while pregnant
Expressing a strong desire to have children while also refusing to become pregnant
Previous terminations of apparently healthy pregnancies
Intense fear that childbirth will result in maternal death , stillbirth, miscarriage or birth defects
Common Facts About Tokophobia
Women who have this disorder will likely refuse going through childbirth without some kind of sedative and they will often be very adamant about wanting a Caesarean section. Still, other women will avoid becoming pregnant altogether, despite their strong desire to have children. These women will often have very stringent contraceptive strategies, using several methods at once. In tokophobic women who went through normal pregnancies, as well as those who had Caesarean sections, some suffered further problems after childbirth such as postnatal depression and delayed bonding with their infants.
Like all phobias, no universal and specific cause exists to explain tokophobia. Rather, there are various unique factors and experiences that contribute to such a disorder. Some of these issues could include a previous traumatic childbirth experience, an intense fear of pain, or even childhood sexual abuse or rape.
Treatment of Tokophobia
It is important for someone who may have tokophobia to seek support from people who genuinely care, including an obstetrician who can work closely and cooperatively with a psychiatrist in order to ensure that the mother, the pregnancy, the infant and the postpartum relationship between the mother and child are healthy. As with any psychological disorder, the initial reasons for the development of the phobia should be addressed by a mental health professional. While much of the fear may stem from the physical pain of a previous birth or other traumatic event, a psychiatrist or psychologist should be able to refer sufferers of tokophobia to doctors that can help moderate the pain of pregnancy or childbirth if that is the best route of treatment to take. There may be some antidepressants available for pregnant women as well.
Tokophobia is definitely not a factor that should hinder a woman’s desire to go through childbirth and have a family. More often than not, this phobia is rooted in irrational fears based on traumatic events that a woman can very likely overcome. If you are seeking help with tokophobia, please seek the support of loved ones and your doctor. There are plenty of people willing to help with not only the symptoms of the disorder, but also the psychological difficulties attendant with it. If you believe your fears of pregnancy and childbirth are irrational, consider the pros and cons with those that know you best. If you think you need help deciding, you may want to ask your doctor.

You’ll have to get used to it. You can’t tell me what to say to you’, says Alice. Arthur Bowden Askey, CBE (6 June 190016 November 1982) was an English comedian and actor. He rose to stardom in 1938 through his role in the first regular radio comedy series, Band Waggon on the BBC. Askey's humour owed much to the playfulness of the characters he portrayed, his improvisation, and his use of catchphrases, which included ""Hello playmates!"", ""I thank you"" (pronounced ""Ay-Thang-Yaw""), and ""Before your very eyes"" He was small in stature at 5'2"" (1.58 m), with a breezy, smiling personality, and wore distinctive horn-rimmed glasses. He was the subject of This Is Your Life on two occasions, in December 1959 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews, dressed as Humpty Dumpty, and in December 1974 when he appeared on a television show discussing the art of dame dame. He also made many stage appearances as a pantomime dame, including the popular West End musical Follow The Girls. He served in the armed forces in World War I and performed in army entertainments. He continued to appear frequently on television in the 1970s, notably as a panellist on the ITV talent show New Faces, where his usually sympathetic comments would offset the harsher judgments of fellow judges Tony Hatch and Mickie Most. He appeared in many sitcoms, including Love and Kisses, Arthur's Treasured Volumes and The Arthur Askey Show. His last film was Rosie Dixon - Night Nurse (1978), starring Debbie Ash. In 1941 he recorded ""The Bee Song"", which was an integral part of his stage and television act for many years, ""Big-Hearted Arthur"" (which was also his nickname) ""The Thing-my-Ummy Bob"" was his theme tune for the West End show Follow the Girls, which he also performed on stage and TV. He died in a car crash in 1986. He is buried in Liverpool, with his wife, Betsy Bowden, who he married in 1949, and their two children, Michael Askey and Anne Askey. He had a son, David, who died in 2007. He has a daughter, Emma, and a step-son, David Askey who is also a comedian. His great-great-grandson is the actor and presenter David Walliams. Askey was awarded the OBE in 1969 and the CBE in 1981. He was married to Elizabeth May Swash in 1925 until her death in 1974; he was the father of actress Anthea Askey (1933-1999) Askey carried on working until just before he was hospitalised in July 1982 which resulted in gangrene and the amputation of both legs. He died in London's St Thomas's Hospital on 16 November 1982 and is buried in Putney Vale Cemetery. The Big Issue is a street newspaper founded by John Bird and Gordon Roddick in September 1991 and published in four continents. It is written by professional journalists and sold by homeless individuals. It exists to offer homeless people, or individuals at risk of homelessness, the opportunity to earn a legitimate income, thereby helping them to reintegrate into mainstream society. In January 2012, the magazine was relaunched, with an increased focus on campaigning and political journalism. New columnists were added, including the Premier League footballer Rachel Johnson and Samira Ahmed. The cover price was increased to £7.99. In 2001 the magazine sold nearly 300,000 copies. Between 2007 and 2011, the circulation of The Big issue declined from 167,000 to less than 125,000. To become a vendor, one must be homeless, one vulnerably housed or marginalised in some way. To be housed, however, that is only the first stage getting off the streets; therefore, the Big Issue Foundation exists to support vendors in gain gain in gain and gain. In the 1970s, Private Eye magazine made the comment that he and the Queen Mother had ""never been seen in the same room together"" The song he intended to record, ""It's Really Nice to See You Mr Hess"" (after Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess fled to Scotland), was banned by the War Office. A collection of Askey's wartime recordings appear on the CD album Band Waggon/Big Hearted Arthur Goes To War. In 1938, Arthur Askey and Richard Murdoch starred in which new radio comedy series? He starred in the radio series ""Band Waggons"" with Richard Murdoch. The title Earl of Merioneth was created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1947 along with the Dukedom of Edinburgh and the Barony of Greenwich for Prince Philip. The Big Issue is sold in the UK, Australia, Ireland, South Korea, South Africa, Japan, Namibia, Kenya, Malawi and Taiwan. All vendors receive training, sign a code of conduct and can be identified by badges which include their photo and vendor number. The Big Issue Foundation is the registered charity arm of the organisation. It aims to underpin the company's work by tackling the underlying causes of homelessness. In 2012, a Romanian Big Issue vendor obtained a court ruling which confirmed that she is entitled, as a self-employed person, to receive housing benefit. The magazine has been criticised for enabling migrants to access the benefits system in this way. It has been the centre of much controversy among publishers of street newspapers, mainly because of its business model. Publishers of some smaller papers, such as Making Change in Santa Monica, California, said they felt threatened when The Big issue began to publish in their area. Others, however, have stated that The Bigissue uses a successful business model to generate a profit to benefit the homeless, and its founder John Bird has said that it is ""possible to be both profitable and ethically correct"" The BigIssue Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation, with all post-investment profits passed to The Big Issues Foundation (legally a separate entity) It is run by John Bird, who was awarded the Ernst & Young Social Entrepreneur of the Year award in October 2008. It is based in London and has offices in New York, Washington, D.C., London, Paris, Madrid, Milan, Rome, Milan and Zagreb, Croatia, among other locations. It was founded by Bird in 1991 to help the homeless by giving them.ng control of their lives by tackling issues which lead to homelessness. There are five localised editions of the magazine sold throughout the United Kingdom and vendors buy the magazine for £1.25 and sell it for £2.50. In 2011, around half of Big Issue sellers in the north of England were of Romani origin, many of whom having migrated from Romania and Bulgaria. In London, 30% of rough sleepers are Eastern European. The company generates income through magazine sales and advertising revenues. In the U.S., some smaller newspapers have criticised it for being overly ""commercial"" and having a flashy design. The term derives from a Middle English borrowing of the Old French panier, meaning 'bread basket' Modern panniers may be rectangular boxes of hard-sided plastic. Panniers are loaded in such a manner as to distribute weight evenly on either side of the animal. For horse packing, and when carrying particularly heavy loads on other animals they are supported by a pack saddle. The modern bicycle pannier was invented by Hartley Alley (1919-2001) of Boulder, CO, in 1971. James Grieve is a savoury, juicy apple with strong acidity at first, which then mellows as the fruit matures during September, but the flesh softens soon thereafter. When picked early, it makes a sweet and delicate stewed apple, but then can be used as a dessert. The term 'pannier' can also be used to refer to a bag or bag-like container, such as a suitcase or briefcase, or a bag of clothes or shoes. It can also refer to an apple, which can be packed in a wicker basket or plastic bag, or even a plastic bag with a lidded lid, and is called a 'James Grieve apple' or a 'Wicker Grieve' Pannier bags can be made out of grocery bags, grocery baskets, garment-bags, convertible backpacks, and various multi-purpose bags as alternatives to purchasing a commercial pannie. The first pannies designed specifically for bicycles were patented by John B. Wood of Camden, NJ, in 1884. The most common setup is to use a pair of smaller panners (10 to 15 liters each) mounted on a low rider. A pair of larger ones on the rear carrier (20 to 30 liters per person) is also common.Commuters who bicycle have pannaier options designed to hold laptop computers, files and folders, changes of clothes, shoes and lunches. Some cyclists create makeshift panniere bags out of groceries, garment bags, and other multi- Purpose bags to hold items such as purses, backpacks and laptop cases. The word 'pannaier' means 'to pack' or 'to carry' in French, which is how it is used in the U.S. James Grieve, Blenheim Orange, Irish Peach, and Ashmead's Kernel are traditional varieties of apple. Allinson is a brand of bread and of flour made by Allied Bakeries being owned by Associated British Foods. The company is based in Maidenhead in Berkshire, at the same address as ABF. It only makes wholemeal bread (not brown bread). The brand is worth around £20m and sells two varieties: Wholemeal and Hi-Bran. In the United States the word Congress is used as a descriptive term for the collective body of legislators. Members of Congress in both houses are elected by direct popular vote. Senators are elected via a statewide vote and representatives by voters in each congressional district. Congressional districts are apportioned to the states, once every ten years, based on population figures from the most recent nationwide census. A Member of Congress (MC) is a person who has been appointed or elected and inducted into an official body called a congress, typically to represent a particular constituency in a legislature. Member of Parliament (MP) is an equivalent term in other jurisdictions. A member of the House of Representatives is usually referred to as Congressman (Congressman ""name"" from the ""number"" district of ""state""), or Representative (Representative "" name"" from ""state""). A Senator is typically referred to. as Senator (Senator ""name's from "" state""), and a member. of the Senate is typically known as a 'class' of senators. No state has both its senators in the same class. The Unites States is the only country in the world where the term 'Congressman' is used to refer to a member of Congress. The term 'Representative' is also used for members of the U.S. House of Reps. and the Senate. The word 'Senator' refers to members of Congress who are elected to serve a six-year term representing a particular state or congressional district, and is used less often than other terms such as 'Representatives' or 'Congressmen' The word Senator is used more often in the UK than in other countries such as Australia and New Zealand, where it is used by the US Congress. The Treaty of Brussels was signed on 17 March 1948 between Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. It provided a basis upon which the 1954 Paris Conference established the Western European Union (WEU) It was terminated on 31 March 2010. The Treaty was intended to provide western Europe with a bulwark against the communist threat and to bring greater collective security. It was a precursor to NATO and similar to it in the sense that it promised European mutual defence. However, it envisaged a purely European mutual Defence pact primarily against Germany, whereas NATO took shape the next year. The treaty was signed by the following plenipotentiaries: Prince Charles of Belgium, as the reigning Prince Regent of Belgium. Vincent Auriol, President of France. Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxemb. The Seventeenth Amendment changed how senators were elected. Originally, senators wereelected by state legislatures. The Amendment changed this to senators being elected directly by popular vote. The Constitution of the United States was created in Article I of the Constitution, where the Founding Fathers laid out the limitations and powers of Congress. Article I grants Congress legislative power and lists the enumerated powers and allows Congress to make laws that are necessary and proper. It specifies the election and composition of the House of Representatives and Senate and the qualifications necessary to serve in each chamber. It also gives the qualifications for each chamber of the U.S. House of Representative. The House of  Representatives is the lower house of the US Congress. The Senate is the higher house of Congress, and has the lower chamber, the Senate. It has the following members: the Representatives, the Senators, the Representatives and the Representatives of the states. It is also the seat of the Speaker of the Senate, the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader, and the Vice-President of the House of Representatives. The Speaker of the Senate has the power to veto legislation and to suspend legislation. It has the power to impose prohibitions on the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court and the Executive Council. Minster Way is a 50 mi walking route between the Minsters of Beverley and York. It crosses the chalk hills of the Yorkshire Wolds, as well as a wide variety of the East Riding of Yorkshire countryside. The route is waymarked by white symbols depicting a view of an ecclesiastical building representing the words Minster Way. A badge was created by the founder of the walk for hikers to display as proof of completion. It is similar to the waymarks, except the picture and words are in yellow on a red background. It was established in 1980 by Ray Wallis of theEast Yorkshire Area of The Ramblers. The walk starts at Beverley, and heads north through the town and crosses the A164 at Hessle. It finishes at Stamford Bridge, where it follows the River Derwent into the Plain of York as far as the River Ouse. It links to other paths, namely the Beverley Twenty; Blackpool to Bridlington (Aerospace Way); Chalkland Way; East Riding Heritage Way; Jorvic Way; Trans Pennine Trail; Wilberforce Way and theorkshire Wolds Way National Trail. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was signed in Washington DC in 1949. The Western Union Defence Organization structure was absorbed into NATO from December 1950 to April 1951. In 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon took over the WEU's mutual defence clause. West Germany and Italy were invited to join the pact, and accordingly the Western European Union was established. The activities of WEU were terminated by June 2011. The Treaty of Brussels, the precursor to NATO and a basis for WEU, was signed on 17 March 1948 by Belgium, France, the UK, the Netherlands and which other nation? The answer is: Luxemborg. The treaty was signed by France, Britain, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Italy and the Republic of Ireland. The WEU was terminated on 31 March 2010 by the ten member states of the European Union. The European Council of Ministers decided to terminate the treaty on 28 March 2010. The decision was made by the Council of ministers of Belgium, the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands, and the European Commission of Ministers of Luxembourg and the City of Luxembourg. The Brussels Treaty was signed at the end of March 1948. The Minster Way is a walking path linking the Minster Market Weight Weight and the Wolds. The walk follows the Hull to Scarborough railway line and the Catchwater Drain on the left towards New Arram. It then meanders in a north-west direction over Heslington Common to cross over the A64 York Bypass by way of the bridge. The path heads north to Fulford on the outskirts of York and crosses the A19 and joins a footpath leading towards the River Ouse. It ends at the Foss Walk at the footbridge over the River Foss. The Minster.

Badjelly the Witch is a brief handwritten, illustrated story by Spike Milligan, created for his children, then printed in 1973. In 1975, in the planning for an audio version for the BBC ""infant's programme"" Let's Join In, Milligan objected to the planned removal of God from the story. The BBC wrote in a letter that the object is not to put God on the same level as goblins, to which Milligan replied that goblins, fairies and God all exist. In 2010/11, there was a production created by the Chickenshed Theatre Company called Badjelly's Bad Christmas. The show was directed by Rosane McNamara, and featured actors Vanessa Caswill, Jodine Muir, David Walker and Richie Black. In 2015, 8 May was designated as a day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, but it is not a public holiday. V-E Day was the public holiday celebrated on 8 May 1945 (7 May in Commonwealth realms) to mark the formal acceptance by the Allies of World War II of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender of its armed forces. The term VE Day existed as early as September 1944,  in anticipation of victory. On 30 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader, committed suicide during the Battle of Berlin. Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorised by his successor, Reichspräsident Karl Dönitz, known as the Flensburg Government. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France and on8 May in Berlin, Germany. On 9 May, the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries have historically celebrated the end of world War II on 9 May. However, the Baltic countries now commemorate VE day on 8 April. In Ukraine from 2015, the day is designated as the day of remembrance and reconciliation. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (the future Princess Elizabeth) appeared on the balcony of the Queen and her sister Princess Maia. In New Zealand, where it was regularly played on morning radio, it was a huge success and has sold over 40000 recordings up to 2012. The script is available through Playmarket, New Zealand's script agency. Both seasons were hugely successful, with the show being performed for a season during 2006 for the New Theatre, Sydney. In the United States, the victory happened on President Harry Truman's 61st birthday. He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier. Since the Soviet Union was to the east of Germany, it was 9 May Moscow time when the German military surrender became effective, which is why Russia and most of the former Soviet republics commemorate Victory Day on 9 May instead of 8 May. In 1995 the May Day bank holiday was moved from the first Monday in May, 1 May, to Monday 8 May, for that year only, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War. In 2015, Victory Day in the UK was moved to the last Monday of May, 8th May, instead of 1st May, in honour of the fallen soldiers of World War II. The date is also known in France as Victoire 1945 and Slovakia as Deň víťazstva nad fašizmom (Victory over Fascism Day) and in the Netherlands as ""Bevrijdingsdag"" (Liberation Day) — from 2015. In the UK, May Day is a bank holiday, but not a public holiday, as it was from 1950 to 1966 and in 1985. In 1985, the date was changed to 8 May to mark the end of the war and the creation of the Commonwealth of Nations. It was also known as Tag der Befreiung (Day of Liberation) between 1950 and 1966 and between 1975 and 1990, as Tag des Sieges (9 May) – National Victory Day. In 2005, the day was renamed ""Victory Day over Nazism in World War Two"" — from 2014, it is known as ""Day of the Liberation"" in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The day is also called ""The Liberation Day"" in Italy, Denmark, Norway, Belgium and the Czech Republic. It is known in other countries as ""Festa della Liberazione"" (The Liberation) or ""Befrielsen"" (Festa del Liberation) and as ""Liberation Holiday"" (25 April) in Italy. In Russia, it's called ""День пам'яті та примирення"" (Memorial Day)    9 May is celebrated in Ukraine as ""Гране перемоги нацизмом у Другіій світові’ (Victories Day) or  “The Liberation” (May 8 unless otherwise stated) Nicholas Lyndhurst played Rodney Trotter in Only Fools and Horses.

He said no to diving show - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk/Television*Be*Bullshot to the Nation*Endless Nights* on January 1872:Wilfred Baddeley (Wilfred. Baddley) Baddlley (1872-1911) was the nation’s second most popular actor. He died in a car crash on January 11, 2011. He was 46 years old and has been married to his wife, Lucy, since 1999. His son Archie was born on February 11, 1999 and he has been engaged to his long-term girlfriend, actress Emma Thompson, since July 2013. He currently lives in Sussex with wife Lucy and son Archie. Wilfred Baddeley was a former World No. 1 British male tennis player. He won four doubles championships at Wimbledon in 1891, 1894 – 1896. The Thelwall Viaduct is a steel composite girder viaduct in Lymm, Warrington, England. It carries the M6 motorway across the Manchester Ship Canal and the River Mersey. It actually comprises two entirely separate bridges, one of 4,414 feet long carrying the northbound carriageway and the one of 336 feet crossing the ship canal. In April 2011 a massive Freeparty took place under the bridge, with reportedly over 5,000 ravers in attendance. The bridge's height and openness to the elements has frequently been the subject of speed reductions due to strong gusts of wind that badly affect the stability of high-sided vehicles. On several occasions lane closures have resulted as a consequence of articulated vehicles simply being blown over. However, the open sides of the bridge are a deliberate design feature to reduce the likelihood of snow drifts building on the carriageeways. In July 2002 a failed roller bearing was discovered and it became necessary to close all but one northbound lane. The brothers retired from competitive lawn tennis after the 1897 Wimbledon Championships to pursue their law careers. They joined their uncle and father Thomas and E. P. Baddoley in Leadenhall Street at the family firm, founded by their great grandfather in 1790. They remained partners in the firm until 1919, when they retired leaving their cousin, Cyril Badd eley, to carry on in the family name.

The main tissue is that which is unique for the specific organ, such as the myocardium, the main tissue of the heart. In single-cell organisms like bacteria, the functional analogue of an organ is called organelle. Organs exist in all higher biological organisms, in particular they are not restricted to animals, but can also be identified in plants. The study of plant organs is referred to as plant morphology, rather than anatomy, as in animal systems. The organ level of organisation in animals can be first detected in flatworms and the more advanced phyla. The less-advanced taxons (like Placozoa, Porifera and Radiata) do not show consolidation of their tissues into organs. In flowering plants, the organ that bears reproductive structures is called a cone. In other plants, other divisions of reproductive organs are called Lyodiophyta, or simply gametophores in mosses or simply simply gamete. The vegetative oeuvre of plants can be divided into vegetative plant organs, stems, leaves, and seed conifers. The reproductive organs of plants are represented by flower, seed and seedcone conifer, and are called the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, mammary glands, testes, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate and penis. A hollow organ is a visceral organ that forms a hollow tube or pouch, such. as the stomach or intestine, or that includes a cavity, like the heart or urinary bladder. In anatomy, a viscus is an internal organ, and viscera is the plural form. The functions of organ systems often share significant overlap. For instance, the nervous and endocrine system both operate via a shared organ, the hypothalamus. For this reason, the two systems are combined and studied as the neuroendocrine system. The same is true for the musculoskeletal system because of the relationship between the muscular and skeletal systems. These specific systems are also widely studied in human anatomy and are also known as 'organ systems' The organ system is also called a biological system or body system. It includes the cardiovascular system, digestive system, liver, pancreas, intestines, colon, rectum and anus. gans are essential for maintaining the life of a plant. While there can be 11 organ systems in animals, there are far fewer in plants. The English word ""organ"" derives from the Latin ', meaning ""instrument"", itself from the Greek word,'(""implement; organ of the body""). The Greek word is related to, "" (""work""). The viscera, when removed from a butchered animal, are known collectively as offal. Internal organs are also informally known as ""guts"" (which may also refer to the gastrointestinal tract), or more formally, ""innards"" The Englishword ""organism"" is a neologism coined in the 17th century, probably formed from the verb to organize. At first the word referred to an organization or social system. The meaning of a living animal or plant is first recorded in 1842. Plant organs are made from tissue built up from different types of tissue. When there are three or more organs it is called an organ system. Some alchemists (e.g. Paracelsus) adopted the Hermetic Qabalah assignment between the 7 vital organs and the 7 Classical planets as follows: ""What reddish-brown bean-shaped organs lies in the abdomen just under the diaphragm, one on each side of the backbone?"" The human kidney is one of the 7 Vital Organs of Antiquity. The term ""visceral"" is contrasted with the term """", meaning ""of or relating to the wall of a body part, organ or cavity"". The two terms are often used in describing a membrane or piece of connective tissue, referring to the opposing sides.

A language game (also called secret language or ludling or argot) is a system of manipulating spoken words to render them incomprehensible to the untrained ear. Language games are used primarily by groups attempting to conceal their conversations from others. Some common examples are Pig Latin; the Gibberish family, prevalent in the United States and Sweden; and Verlan, spoken in France. Some language games such as Pig Latin are so widely known that privacy is virtually impossible, as most people have a passable understanding of how it works. Some words from language games have made their way into normal speech, such as ilchay in English (from Pig Latin), and loufoque in French (from Louchébem) The APF is proud to announce that Sydney Polo Club will bid to host the 2018 Finals of the World Cup Polo. Peter and Rebecca Higgins will fly to Argentina this month along with APF Director Ian McDuie to make their presentation to FIP (Federation of International Polo) The Australian Polo Federation (APF) is the governing body for the sport of polo in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK. It is the first time the APF has been involved in the bidding process for the FIP World Polo Championships. The FIP will be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2015 and 2016. It will be the first FIP tournament to be held outside of South America. The tournament will be hosted by the Argentinian capital of Buenos Aires and will take place from September to October 2015. FIP is the only international polo tournament that is not held in South America or the Caribbean. It has been held in Argentina for the last five years. The Argentinian tournament is the most popular polo competition in the world. It was founded in 1986 and is held in the city of Aragon, Argentina. The event is one of the largest polo tournaments in the U.S. and the world, with more than 100,000 fans attending each year. It also takes place in New Zealand and South Africa. The competition is held every two years and is the biggest polo event in the country. The winner of the tournament is crowned the champion. ich MacIntyre posed as a wannabe-member of the Chelsea Headhunters. He had a Chelsea tattoo applied to himself for authenticity, although the hardcore were surprised he chose the hated ""Millwall lion"" badge rather than the 1960s Chelsea erect lion one. The programme led to arrests and several convictions. Jason Marriner who was convicted and sent to prison as a result of the show, has since written a book, ""Stitch-Up For a Blue Sole"", claiming to have been set up by the BBC. He claims that footage was manipulated, 'incidents' were manufactured and they were convicted despite having no footage of them committing crimes. Kevin Whitton, a high-profile member of the firm, was sentenced to life imprisonment on 8 November 1985 for violent assault after being found guilty of involvement in an attack on a pub on Kings Road. On 25 March 2011, 24 people were convicted of taking part in the violence, which resulted in several people being injured (including a police officer whose jaw was broken) at Isleworth Crown Court. All of those convicted received banning orders from all football grounds in England and Wales ranging from three years to eight years. Eighteen of them received prison sentences of up to two years. The firm formed an alliance with other British hooligans supporting Linfield F.C., Cardiff City, Swansea City and Leeds United led by Arsenal's firm, The Herd, to attack Galatasaray fans in Copenhagen and Heysel Stadium as part of revenge for the 2000 UEFA Cup semi-final stabbing of two Leeds United fans. Other allies were supporters of Lazio and Hellas Verona. In 2000, Chelsea Headhunter Randy Ollins appeared in Blaney's autobiography The Undesirables with a caption by Blaney commending headhunters on being one of the top firms, indicating a mutual respect between the Headhunter and Blaney. The film focuses mainly on the firm's violent rivalry with the Millwall Bushwackers. The Film Factory is a fictionalized account of the Headhunter's rivalry with MillwallBushwackers, directed by Liam Galvin (Gangster Toy Videos) Organs are composed of main tissue, parenchyma, and ""sporadic"" tissues, stroma. The main tissue is that which is unique for the specific organ, such as the myocardium, the main tissue of the heart. Organs exist in all higher biological organisms, in particular they are not restricted to animals, but can also be identified in plants. In single-cell organisms like bacteria, the functional analogue of an organ is called organelle. A hollow organ is a visceral organ that forms a hollow tube or pouch. The organ level of organisation in animals can be first detected in flatworms and the more advanced phyla. The less-advanced taxons (like Placozoa, Porifera and Radiata) do not show consolidation of their tissues into organs. The organs of plants can be divided into vegetative and reproductive. In flowering plants by the flower and fruit, the organ that bears the reproductive structures is called a cone (phyla) In conifers, the organs are represented by the seed.

The answer is 'Chelsy' The club is now known as Manchester City FC and is based in Old Trafford, north London. The club has also had a number of high-profile incidents, including the death of a fan and the arrest of a police officer. It is also known as 'The Football Association' or 'The FA' The FA is the body that runs the Premier League and the FA Cup. The FA has also been known to have had a series of high profile incidents, like the murder of a football fan by a fan in 2007. The headhunters were known as the 'Headhunters', and the club has since been renamed the 'Football Association' The Football Association is a non-profit organisation. It was set up by the Football Association to promote the sport of football in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s. It also has a charitable foundation, the Football Foundation, to which it has donated more than £1.5million. The Football Foundation is also a charity, which has raised over £2.4million for charity in recent years. Tokophobia is an extreme and uncontrollable fear of childbirth or pregnancy. It can lead to an elective termination of some pregnancies because of fear. The psychological stress attendant with the disorder can often be damaging to a pregnancy even if the woman does not elect to terminate it. Tokophobia may only be a byproduct of other emotional and behavioral disorders such as clinical depression. Some alchemists (e.g. Paracelsus) adopted the Hermetic Qabalah assignment between the 7 vital organs and the 7 Classical planets as follows: Question: Which organ of the human body is affected by Hepatitis? The answer is: ""The organ that creates the new generation of plants"" The English word ""organism"" is a neologism coined in the 17th century, probably formed from the verb to organize. The meaning of a living animal or plant is first recorded in 1842. The term ""visceral"" is contrasted with the term """", meaning ""of or relating to the wall of a body part, organ or cavity"". The two terms are often used in describing a membrane or piece of connective tissue, referring to the opposing sides. 7 Vital Organs of Antiquity: The 7 Vital organs of the Antiquity – The 7 Organs Of The Antiquity, The 7 Essential Organs, The Seven Vital Oils of the Antiquity, and The Seven Essential Oils Of The Antiquities. The 7 Oceans: The Seven Oceans, The Earth, The Moon, The Sun, the Earth, the Moon, the Sun, and the Earth’s moons. The Seven Organs: The Earth and the Moon. The Earth. The Sun. The moon. The planets: Earth, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Urania, and Neptune. The seven vital organs of theAntiquity: the 7 Vital Oceans and the Seven Ores: the seven vital ores, the seven essential ores of the Antonine, Proteus and Proteum. The seventh vital organ: the heart. The heart is the most important organ in the body, followed by the lungs, the kidneys, the pancreas, the stomach, the intestines, the gallbladder, the appendix and the appendix. Women who have tokophobia will likely refuse going through childbirth without some kind of sedative. They will often be very adamant about wanting a Caesarean section. Other women will avoid becoming pregnant altogether, despite their strong desire to have children. These women will often have very stringent contraceptive strategies, using several methods at once. In tokophobic women who went through normal pregnancies, as well as those who had Caesarian sections, some suffered further problems after childbirth such as postnatal depression and delayed bonding with their infants. There may be some antidepressants available for pregnant women as well. There are plenty of people willing to help with not only the symptoms of the disorder, but also the psychological difficulties attendant with it. If you believe your fears of pregnancy and childbirth are irrational, consider the pros and cons with those that know you best. Ifyou think you need help deciding, you may want to ask your doctor.

Apéritif and digestif
Apéritifs and digestifs ( and) are drinks, typically alcoholic,  that are normally served before (apéritif) or after (digestif) a meal.

Apéritifs

An apéritif is an alcoholic beverage usually served before a meal to stimulate the appetite, and is therefore usually dry rather than sweet. Common choices for an apéritif are vermouth; champagne; pastis; gin; rakı; fino, amontillado or other styles of dry sherry (but not usually cream sherry, which is very sweet and rich); and any still, dry, light white wine.

""Apéritif"" may also refer to a snack that precedes a meal. This includes an amuse-bouche, such as crackers, cheese, pâté or olives.  

""Apéritif"" is a French word derived from the Latin verb aperire, which means ""to open."" The French slang word for ""apéritif"" is ""apéro,"" although in France an ""apéro"" is also food eaten in the late afternoon/early evening.

History

St. Diadochos of Photiki, in his writing on the Christian Spiritual Life, On Spiritual Knowledge, states, ""People who wish to discipline the sexual organs should avoid drinking those artificial concoctions which are called 'aperitifs'- presumably because they open a way to the stomach for the vast meal which is to follow."" St. Diadochos was born around 400 A.D. and died sometime before 486 A.D. He was from Northern Greece and was a significant theologian during the Council of Chalcedon (451). Therefore, the use of apéritifs to affect one's consumption of food was a practice in the 5th century. 

The landmark of aperitif birth is 1796, when Antonio Carpano created in Turin the recipe of vermouth.

The apéritif was introduced in France in 1846 when a French chemist, Joseph Dubonnet, created his eponymous wine-based drink as a means of delivering malaria-fighting quinine. The medicine was a bitter brew, so he developed a formula of herbs and spices to mask quinine's sharp flavor, and it worked so well that the recipe has remained well-guarded ever since. French Foreign Legion soldiers made use of it in mosquito-infested Northern Africa. Joseph's wife was so fond of the drink that she had all her friends try it, and its popularity spread.

Apéritifs were already widespread in the 19th century in Italy, where they were being served in fashionable cafés in Rome, Genoa, Florence, Milan, Turin, and Venice. Apéritifs became very popular in Europe in the late 19th century. The popularity in Europe crossed the Atlantic and by 1900, they were also commonly served in the United States. The apéritif recrossed the Atlantic in the 1970s: the habit of a substantial food offering with the purchase of a drink during ""Happy Hour"" in the United States pushed the development of a more food-heavy apéritif in Italy as well. 
In Spain and in some countries of Latin America, apéritifs have been a staple of tapas for centuries.

Types

There is no single alcoholic drink that is always served as an apéritif. Fortified wine, liqueur, and dry champagne are probably the most common choices. Because it is served before dining, the emphasis is usually on dry rather than sweet, as a general guideline.

* In France, the apéritif varies from region to region : pastis is popular in the south of France, Calvados brandy in the Normandy region, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne wine or Cognac may also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and very popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (black currant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The word Kir Royal is used when white wine is replaced with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches.
* In Italy, vermouth or wine may be served as the apéritif (called aperitivo). Aperol spritz and Campari with soda are also popular aperitivo drinks of choice.
* In Greece, ouzo is a popular choice, except on Crete, where it is very common to take some raki after a meal.
* In the Eastern Mediterranean, arak is served with meze.

Digestifs

A digestif is an alcoholic beverage served after a meal, in theory, to aid digestion.  When served after a coffee course, it may be called pousse-café.  Digestifs are usually taken straight.
Common kinds of digestif include: 
* Brandy (Cognac, Armagnac, alembic-made) 
** Eaux de vie (fruit brandies, Schnapps, Calvados)
** Pomace brandy (grappa)
* Fortified wines (sweet sherry (usually cream sherry), vermouth, port, and madeira)
* Liqueurs bitter or sweet (drambuie, amari (such as fernet), herbal liqueur, chartreuse, Grand Marnier, Jagermeister, Irish Mist, Kahlua, limoncello, Herbs de Majorca, Unicum, Underberg, Fernet-Branca, Mirto)
* Distilled liquors (ouzo, tequila, whisky or akvavit)
* Liquor cocktails (Black Russian, Rusty Nail, etc.)

In certain areas, it is not uncommon for a digestif to be taken before a main course. One example is le trou Normand, a glass of Calvados taken before the main course of a meal.

Bitter digestifs typically contain carminative herbs, which are thought to aid digestion. 

In many countries, people drink alcoholic beverages at lunch and dinner. Studies have found that when food is eaten before drinking alcohol, alcohol absorption is reduced and the rate at which alcohol is eliminated from the blood is increased. The mechanism for the faster alcohol elimination appears to be unrelated to the type of food. The likely mechanism is food-induced increases in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes and liver blood flow.
Question:
Which aperitif is named for the Paris chemist who created it in 1846?
Answer:
","Passage:
When You Wish upon a Star
""When You Wish upon a Star"" is a song written by Leigh Harline and Ned Washington for Walt Disney's 1940 adaptation of Pinocchio.  The original version was sung by Cliff Edwards in the character of Jiminy Cricket, and is heard over the opening credits and in the final scene of the film. The song has since become the representative song of The Walt Disney Company. The recording by Cliff Edwards and Chorus was released by Victor Records as catalogue number 261546 and 26477A (in USA) and by EMI on the His Master's Voice Label as catalogue number BD 821.

Edwards recorded another version in 1940 for an American Decca Records ""cover version"" of the score of Pinocchio, conducted by Victor Young and featuring soprano Julietta Novis and The King's Men. It was first released on a 4-record 78-RPM album set, and years later as one side of an LP, backed by selections from The Wizard of Oz. A recording with Christian Rub (with Mister Geppetto's voice), Cliff Edwards and Chorus was released by Victor Records as catalogue number 26479B (in USA) and by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalogue number BD 823. It won the 1940 Academy Award for Best Original Song. It was also the first Disney song to win an Oscar.

Influence

The American Film Institute ranked ""When You Wish upon a Star"" seventh in their 100 Greatest Songs in Film History, the highest ranked Disney animated film song, and also one of only four Disney animated film songs to appear on the list, the others being ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ranked at #19, ""Beauty and the Beast"" from Beauty and the Beast ranked at #62, and ""Hakuna Matata"" from The Lion King, ranked at #99.

The song reached the top one in Billboard's Record Buying Guide, a predecessor of the retail sales chart. Popular versions included Glenn Miller, Guy Lombardo, Horace Heidt and Cliff Edwards.

In Japan, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Denmark, the song has become a Christmas song, often referring to the Star of Bethlehem. The Swedish language version is called Ser du stjärnan i det blå, roughly translated: ""Do you see the star in the blue"", and the Danish title is ""Når du ser et stjerneskud"", which translates as ""When you see a shooting star"". In Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway the song is played on television every Christmas Eve in the traditional Disney one-hour Christmas cabaret From All of Us to All of You, and the gathering of the entire family to watch this is considered a Scandinavian tradition.

In 1978, Gene Simmons, the bassist and co-vocalist of hard rock band Kiss, covered the song for his Platinum-certified Gene Simmons solo album because he related to the song and was a fan of Disney movies. ""When I first heard that song I could barely speak English but I knew the words were true. Anybody can have what they want, the world and life can give its rewards to anyone"". 

In 1986, Linda Ronstadt recorded the classic song for her Platinum-certified album For Sentimental Reasons. Released as the album's first single, it peaked at #32 in Billboard Magazine at year's end.

Eliane Elias included the song in her 1987 album Cross Currents.

The Library of Congress deemed the song ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and preserved it into the National Recording Registry in 2009.

Brian Wilson admits that the melody of The Beach Boys hit song, ""Surfer Girl"", which has the same AABA form,  is loosely based on the Dion and the Belmonts version of ""When You Wish upon a Star"".     Wilson also covered it on his album In the Key of Disney, which was released on October 25, 2011.

Disney icon

""When You Wish upon a Star"", along with Mickey Mouse, has become an icon of The Walt Disney Company. In the 1950s and 1960s, Walt Disney used the song in the opening sequences of all the editions of the Walt Disney anthology television series. It has also been used to accompany the Walt Disney Pictures opening logos – including the present-day logo – since the 1980s. The ships of the Disney Cruise Line use the first seven notes of the song's melody as their horn signals. Additionally, many productions at Disney theme parks – particularly fireworks shows and parades – employ the song.

Jazz

The piece has become a jazz standard.  It has been performed by artists including Louis Armstrong, June Christy, Dave Brubeck Quartet, Glenn Miller, Harry James, Joe Pass, the Keith Jarrett Trio, The Manhattan Transfer, Sun Ra, Jason Becker and Bill Evans.

Lawsuit

The owner of the rights to the song, Bourne Co. Music Publishers, sued Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., Fox Broadcasting Company, Fuzzy Door Productions, Cartoon Network, Walter Murphy and Seth MacFarlane to try to stop distribution of a 2003 Family Guy episode entitled ""When You Wish upon a Weinstein"" that parodies the song in a version called ""I Need a Jew"". A federal judge ruled against Bourne Co, stating that a parody of the song did not infringe on the company's copyright.

Passage:
The Eel (film)
is a 1997 film directed by Shohei Imamura and starring Kōji Yakusho, Misa Shimizu, Mitsuko Baisho, and Akira Emoto. The film is loosely based on the novel On Parole by celebrated author Akira Yoshimura, combined with elements from the director's 1966 film The Pornographers. It shared the Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival with Taste of Cherry.  It also won the 1998 Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film of the Year.

Plot

Acting on the advice of an anonymous note, Takuro Yamashita (Kōji Yakusho) returns home early one night to find his wife in bed with another man. He kills her and then turns himself in to the police. After being released from prison, he opens a barber shop and brings along a pet eel which he talks to while mostly ignoring conversation with others. He helps save Keiko Hattori (Misa Shimizu) from a suicide attempt, resulting in her working at the shop. She starts developing romantic feelings for him, but he acts nonchalant and refuses the boxed lunches she prepares for him when he goes eel-hunting with the fisherman Jukichi Takada. Takuro recognizes the local garbageman from prison and the garbageman starts to stalk Takuro and Keiko, believing that Takuro isn't repentant enough for his crimes. He attempts to rape Keiko and leaves a letter revealing Takuro's past on the door of his barber shop, but it is removed by Takada. Keiko finds out that she is pregnant with the baby of Eiji Dojima (Tomorowo Taguchi), a loan shark, and that it is too late for an abortion. One night the garbageman goes to Takuro's shop and lectures him, accusing him of killing his wife out of jealousy. The two get into an altercation and Takuro fends him off. Keiko goes back to her old company, where she is the vice-president, and retrieves her mother's bankbook. This results in Dojima angrily going to the barber shop, along with henchman, and accusing her of theft since he was planning to reinvest the funds into his business. Dojima's group and Keiko's fight, with the false revelation that Keiko is pregnant with Takuro's child. The police find that Keiko's mother never signed power of attorney papers for Dojima, but a parole violation meeting for Takuro causes him to be sent back to prison for a year. Takuro lets his eel go and accepts a boxed lunch from Keiko, who promises to wait for him with her baby.

Reception

Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times said that the film ""swims with grace, insight and vast compassion"", complimenting the ""vivid"" cast that allowed the director ""not only to bare the passions that seethe beneath the orderly surface and apparent conformity of Japanese life but also to ponder emotions and issues that know no nationality.""  David Stratton of Variety described the film as ""filled with colorful characters, and fluctuating alarmingly — but with surprising success — among several levels on the emotional spectrum"", saying that the director ""has created a rich tapestry of characters and situations, all of it vividly brought to life with pristine visuals and a generous emotional warmth.""  Describing its cinematography, Noah Cowan of Filmmaker Magazine said that the film ""is shot in sunny, saturated colors, lending it the air of a filmmaker content with his achievements in the sunset of his career.""

These 10 animal facts will amaze you
In French, a brochette is a skewer, and foods cooked on a skewer are said to be en brochette. The word has been adopted into the English language, and English speakers usually interpret “brochette” to refer to food which has been cooked on a skewer, typically in a French style. In some parts of the American south, especially Louisiana, many types of brochettes are available, an enduring testimony to the French cultural influence in these areas. Brochette is available in some French restaurants as well, and it can also be made at home.
Many cuisines around the world have some version of the brochette. In Greece, it is known as souvlaki, while Thais call it satay and many Middle Easterners know it as kabob. As a general rule, people use specific ethnic terms to refer to foods from that nation, and “brochette” is usually used to discuss French food. However, a great deal of fusion between cuisines has occurred, leading to French style brochette served with Thai peanut sauce , for example.
The core of any brochette is, of course, the skewer. Foods are pierced with the skewer for cooking, whether they are grilled, baked, sauteed, roasted, or broiled. Diners can eat food directly off the skewer, sometimes using the skewer as a handle to dip the food in sauce, or they can tease the food off with an eating utensil for more tidy consumption. Typically, foods are coated in a marinade or rub before they are cooked.
Meats such as lamb, chicken, game, and seafood are common offerings in brochettes. Vegetables and fruits can also be used, and many cooks mix the two for flavor variation. Brochette may be served on its own, sometimes with a dipping sauce, or it may be part of a larger plate, as is the case with brochette served over rice or pasta. It is a common inclusion at buffet spreads, since brochettes can be easily picked up and handled by guests.
Making a brochette at home is quite easy. You'll need skewers and whatever ingredients you would like to cook on them, along with a marinade. For a very basic marinade, try mixing olive oil, vinegar , Worcestershire sauce, garlic , finely chopped onions, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Cut the food into evenly sized chunks, and marinate it for at least half an hour before putting it on the skewers. Cook the skewers using your method of choice, and serve warm with slices of lemon.

Radetzky March
Radetzky March, Op. 228, is a march composed by Johann Strauss Sr. and dedicated to Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky von Radetz. First performed on 31 August 1848 in Vienna, it soon became quite popular among regimented marching soldiers. It has been remarked that its tone is more celebratory than martial; Strauss was commissioned to write the piece to commemorate Radetzky's victory at the Battle of Custoza.

Origin

Strauss had already used the famous theme in his Jubel-Quadrille, Op. 130; the upbeat bears considerable resemblance to the second theme from the Allegro in Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 100 composed in 1794. The striking rhythmic pattern—three anapaests, one iamb—has since then been popularised by numerous parody versions. 

For the trio, Strauss used an older folk melody called Alter Tanz aus Wien or Tinerl-Lied (Tinerl was a popular Viennese songstress of the day) which was originally in 3/4 time. When Radetzky came back to Vienna after winning the battle of Custoza (1848), his soldiers were singing the then-popular song. Allegedly Strauss heard this singing and incorporated the melody, converted to 2/4 time, into the Radetzky March. 

Reception

Along with the Blue Danube waltz by Johann Strauss Jr., the piece became an unofficial Austrian national anthem. In 1932 Joseph Roth published his famous novel Radetzky March, chronicling the decline and fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Up to today, the theme is used in numerous promotional jingles and at major sport events, in particular at football matches of the Austrian national team. 

When it was first played in front of Austrian officers, they spontaneously clapped and stamped their feet when they heard the chorus. This tradition, with quiet rhythmic clapping on the first iteration of the melody, followed by thunderous clapping on the second, is kept alive today by audience members who know the custom when the march is played in classical music venues in an orchestral version prepared by Leopold Weninger (1879–1940). It is traditionally played as the last piece at the New Year's Concert (Neujahrskonzert) of the Vienna Philharmonic. In 2001, under conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the orchestra performed both the original and the convert version. The Philharmonics did not play the Radetzky March on 1 January 2005, because of overwhelming losses due to the devastating tsunami in the Indian Ocean a few days before.

Since 1896, this has been the official presentation march of the Chilean Army's Military School of the Liberator Bernardo O'Higgins. The 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards of the United Kingdom adopted the Radetzky March as its regimental quick march.  The Sri Lanka Armoured Corps, whose practices and traditions are based on those of the 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards, also use the Radetzky March as its regimental quick march.

Piece parts

The Radetzky March consists of three main parts:
*The introduction: the whole orchestra plays and the brass section carries the melody.
*The first figure: played by the string section.
*At figure two: the whole orchestra plays until figure three, when it repeats back to the D.S. (first figure).
*The trio: played by the brass section, with the trumpet playing three triplets in the last bars.
*Figure five: the whole orchestra plays. 
*Figure six: the whole orchestra plays and then repeats back to figure five.
*The orchestra plays until the last bar, then returns to the D.C. (beginning).
*The orchestra plays until figure three, finishing with the Fine (""end"") bar—i.e., the direction is Da capo al fine (repeat from beginning up to the word Fine).

Candy corn
Candy corn is a candy most often found in the United States and Canada, popular  primarily around Halloween. The three colors of the candy – a broad yellow end, a tapered orange center, and a pointed white tip – mimic the appearance of kernels of corn.  Each piece is approximately three times the size of a real kernel from a ripe or dried ear.

Candy corn is made primarily from sugar, corn syrup, confectioner's wax, artificial coloring and binders. 

History

Candy corn was created in the 1880s by George Renninger of the Philadelphia, PA-based Wunderle Candy Company. The Goelitz Confectionery Company began production at the turn of the century and called the product ""Chicken Feed.""[http://www.bhg.com/halloween/recipes/the-history-of-candy-corn/ Broek, Sara. ""The History of Candy Corn: A Halloween Candy Favorite,"" Better Homes and Gardens] In 2001 the company was renamed the ""Jelly Belly Candy Company."" 

Sales

The National Confectioners Association estimates that 20 million pounds (just over 9072 metric tons) of candy corn are sold annually. 

Production

Originally the candy was made by hand.  Manufacturers first combined sugar, corn syrup, carnauba wax, and water and cooked them to form a slurry. Fondant was added for texture and marshmallows were added to provide a soft bite. The final mixture was then heated and poured into shaped molds. Three passes, one for each colored section, were required during the pouring process.

The recipe remains basically the same today. The production method, called ""corn starch modeling,"" likewise remains  the same, though tasks initially performed by hand were soon taken over by machines invented for the purpose. 

Variants

A popular variation called ""Indian corn"" features a chocolate brown wide end, orange center and pointed white tip, often available around Thanksgiving. During the Halloween season, blackberry cobbler candy corn can be found in eastern Canada. Confectioners have introduced additional color variations suited to other holidays. The Christmas variant (sometimes called ""reindeer corn"")  typically has a red end and a green center; the Valentine's Day variant (sometimes called ""cupid corn"")  typically has a red end and a pink center; In the United States during Independence Day celebrations, corn with a blue end, white center, and red tip (named ""freedom corn"") can be found at celebratory cook outs and patriotic celebrations; the Easter variant (sometimes called ""bunny corn"") is typically only a two-color candy, and comes with a variety of pastel bases (pink, green, yellow, and purple) with white tips all in one package. In 2011, there were caramel apple and green apple candy corn variants. In 2013 there were s'mores and pumpkin spice variants. In 2014, carrot corn was also introduced for the Easter season, typically being green and orange, and having a carrot cake type flavor.

Sandwich tern
The Sandwich tern (Thalasseus sandvicensis) is a seabird of the tern family, Sternidae. It is very closely related to the lesser crested tern (T. bengalensis), Chinese crested tern (T. bernsteini), Cabot's tern (T. acuflavidus), and elegant tern (T. elegans) and has been known to interbreed with the lesser crested.

The Sandwich tern is a medium-large tern with grey upperparts, white underparts, a yellow-tipped black bill and a shaggy black crest which becomes less extensive in winter with a white crown. Young birds bear grey and brown scalloped plumage on their backs and wings. It is a vocal bird. It nests in a ground scrape and lays one to three eggs.

Like all Thalasseus terns, the Sandwich tern feeds by plunge diving for fish, usually in marine environments, and the offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.

Taxonomy

The terns, family Sternidae, are small to medium-sized seabirds, gull-like in appearance, but usually with a more delicate, lighter build and shorter, weaker legs. They have long, pointed wings, which gives them a fast buoyant flight, and often a deeply forked tail. Most species are grey above and white below, and have a black cap which is reduced or flecked with white in the winter.

The Sandwich tern was originally described by ornithologist John Latham in 1787 as Sterna sandvicensis, but was recently moved to its current genus Thalasseus (Boie, 1822) following mitochondrial DNA studies which confirmed that the three types of head pattern (white crown, black cap, and black cap with a white blaze on the forehead) found amongst the terns corresponded to distinct clades. The current genus name is derived from Greek Thalassa, ""sea"", and sandvicensis, like the English name, refers to Sandwich, Kent, Latham's type locality. In birds, the specific name sandvicensis usually denotes that the species was first described from Hawaii, formerly known as the ""Sandwich Islands"", but the Sandwich tern does not occur there.

This bird has no subspecies. Two former subspecies are now treated as a separate species called Cabot's tern (T. acuflavidus), which breeds on the Atlantic coasts of North America, wintering in the Caribbean and further south, and has wandered to Western Europe. The former species, T. s. eurygnatha (Saunders 1876), is sometimes treated as a separate species called the Cayenne tern (T. eurygnatha), which breeds on the Atlantic coast of South America from Argentina north to the Caribbean, intergrading with T. acuflavidus in the north of its range. The DNA analysis showed that Cayenne tern differed genetically from T. acuflavidus, but the difference was not sufficient to confirm it as a definite separate species.

Description

This is a medium-large tern, 37 - long with an 85 - wingspan, which is unlikely to be confused within most of its range, although the South American race could be confused with the elegant tern.

The Sandwich tern's thin sharp bill is black with a yellow tip, except in the yellow or orange billed South American race. Its short legs are black. Its upperwings are pale grey and its underparts white, and this tern looks very pale in flight, although the primary flight feathers darken during the summer.

The lesser crested tern and elegant tern differ in having all-orange bills; lesser crested also differs in having a grey rump and marginally stouter bill, and elegant in having a slightly longer, slenderer bill. Chinese crested tern is the most similar to Sandwich, but has a reversal of the bill colour, yellow with a black tip; it does not overlap in range with Sandwich tern so confusion is unlikely.

In winter, the adult Sandwich tern's forehead becomes white. Juvenile Sandwich terns have dark tips to their tails, and a scaly appearance on their back and wings, like juvenile roseate terns.

The Sandwich tern is a vocal bird; its call is a characteristic loud grating kear-ik or kerr ink.

Behaviour

This species breeds in very dense colonies on coasts and islands, and exceptionally inland on suitable large freshwater lakes close to the coast. It nests in a ground scrape and lays one to three eggs. Unlike some of the smaller white terns, it is not very aggressive toward potential predators, relying on the sheer density of the nests—often only 20 - apart and nesting close to other more aggressive species such as Arctic terns and black-headed gulls to avoid predation.

Like all Thalasseus terns, the Sandwich tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, almost invariably from the sea. It usually dives directly, and not from the ""stepped-hover"" favoured by Arctic terns. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.

Status

The Sandwich tern has an extensive global range estimated at 100000 –. It has a population estimated at 460,000–500,000 individuals. Population trends have not been quantified, but the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as least concern.

The Sandwich tern is among the taxa to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Parties to the agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation actions which are describes in a detailed action plan. This plan should address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation.

The History of New York Scandals - Mae West’s ‘Sex’ Capade ...
The History of New York Scandals - Mae West’s �Sex’ Capade -- New York Magazine
(Photo: Bettmann/Corbis)
1927
In a 1925ï¿½26 New York theater season with acclaimed new plays by O’Neill (The Great God Brown), O’Casey (Juno and the Paycock), and Coward (Hay Fever), critics agreed that the rock bottom was Sex, the first Broadway vehicle written by and starring the voluptuous vaudeville trouper Mae West. Sex was ï¿½street sweepings,ï¿½ in the verdict of The New Yorker, and ï¿½a crude, inept play, cheaply produced and poorly acted,ï¿½ according to the Times. The paper’s review did helpfully note that the show’s ï¿½one torrid love sceneï¿½ lived up to its title. An ad warning patrons who ï¿½cannot stand excitementï¿½ to ï¿½see your doctor before visiting Mae Westï¿½ didn’t hurt either. The play outlasted nearly all the competition. Variety christened its heroine, a Montreal lady of the evening with a fondness for sailors, ï¿½the Babe Ruth of stage prosties.ï¿½
Politics turned a hit into a Jazz Age phenomenon. When New York’s rakish mayor, Jimmy Walker , took a Havana holiday in February 1927, the acting mayor, Joseph V. (ï¿½Holy Joeï¿½) McKee, raided three risqué Broadway shows. West was the prime target: Sex, then in the tenth month of its run, had been seen by 325,000 theatergoers. To the delight of the tabloid press, its twenty actors were hauled off to a police station in Hell’s Kitchen. The star spent the night in the Jefferson Market Women’s Prison.
West bailed out her company. The court had offered to drop charges if she would close the show. But she knew that in showbiz, crime paid. The grand jury’s claim that her ï¿½obscene, indecent, immoral, and impure dramaï¿½ would abet ï¿½the corruption of the morals of youthï¿½ was better than any rave review. Festooned with white roses, she rode a limo to incarceration on Welfare Island and boasted of wearing silk underwear throughout her eight-day stay there. When Liberty magazine paid her $1,000 for an exit interview, she used it to start a Mae West Memorial Library for female prisoners.
A later West playï¿½The Pleasure Man, awash in female impersonators and homosexualityï¿½would be raided and shut down at its second Broadway performance in 1928. Undaunted, she eventually revived Sex and toured the Depression-era Midwest without incident, before arriving in Hollywood, where, paired with Cary Grant and W. C. Fields, she hit superstardom as she was reaching 40. The Bushwick-born, self-invented West (1893ï¿½1980) wrote the Ur-text for Madonna and Lady Gaga, repeatedly breaking gender and sexual barriers over a marathon career as a writer, performer, free-speech provocateur, and showbiz entrepreneur. Her pioneering playbook for turning scandal into profits remains the gold standard in American pop culture to this day.

Patron Saint of Mountaineers: St. Bernard of Menthon
Have you ever thought there was a patron saint for mountaineers?
Source: Wikipedia.org
Bernard was born ca. 1020, in Menthon. He was descended from a rich and noble family and received thorough education. When he had reached his majority age, he decided to devote himself to the service of the Church and refused an honorable marriage proposed by his father. In popular legend it is said that he had to sneak out of the castle on the night before an arranged wedding, and that during his flight from the castle, he threw himself from his window, only to be captured by angels and lowered gently to the ground 40 feet (12 meters) below.
Under guidance of Peter- Archdeacon of Aosta, he rapidly progressed and was later on ordained to priesthood. On account of his learning and virtue, he was appointed to succeed his mentor as archdeacon of the cathedral, giving him the charge of the government of the diocese, directly under the bishop.
Seeing the old pagan ways still prevailing among the people of the Alps, Bernard resolved to devote himself to their conversion. For 42 years he continued to preach the Gospel to these people and even into many cantons of Lombardy, effecting numerous conversions and working many miracles.
St. Bernards Pass
Nederlands: Pashoogte van de Sint Bernard (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
For another reason, Bernard’s name will forever be famous in history. Since the most ancient times there has been a path across the Pennine Alps leading from the valley of Aosta to the Swiss canton of Valais. The traditional route of this pass is covered with perpetual snow from seven to eight feet deep, and drifts sometimes accumulate to the height of forty feet. Although the pass was extremely dangerous, especially in springtime on account of avalanches, it was often used by French and German pilgrims on their way to Rome.
In his office as archdeacon, Bernard had the charge of caring for the poor and travelers. For their convenience and protection, Bernard founded a canony and hospice at the highet point of the pass, 8,000 feet above sea-level, in the year 1050, at the site which has came to bear his name.
The last act of St. Bernard’s life was the reconciliation of two nobleman whose strife threatened a fatal outcome. He died on June 1081 in the Imperial Free City of Novara and was interred in the monastery of St. Lawrence.

Herzogenaurach
Herzogenaurach (East Franconian: Herziaura) is a town in the district of Erlangen-Höchstadt, in Bavaria, Germany. It is best known for being the home of the sporting goods companies Adidas and Puma,   as well as the large car parts manufacturer Schaeffler Group.

Geography

Herzogenaurach is situated in the Middle Franconia area of Bavaria, approx. 23 km or 14 miles northwest of Nuremberg. The town is located on the Aurach river, a tributary of the Regnitz river.

History

Herzogenaurach was first mentioned in a document from 1002 under the name of Uraha when Holy Roman Emperor Henry II granted the town to the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg.

Economy

Herzogenaurach is the birthplace of two sporting goods giants: Adidas and Puma, founded by the two brothers Adolf Dassler and Rudolf Dassler, after an acrimonious familial split in 1948. Both companies' headquarters are still located in the town on opposite sides of the Aurach River, and brand loyalty is sharply divided as well. For years, Adidas and Puma workers would not associate and even when Adolf and Rudi died, they were buried in opposite ends of the town Cemetery. 

Also the headquarters of Schaeffler Group are located in Herzogenaurach.

Sporting

The Argentina national football team resided in Herzogenaurach for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Néstor De la Torre, Mexico's Director of National Teams, said the Selección de fútbol de México (Mexico national team) would gather for 12 days in the city, its last stop before heading to South Africa for the 2010 World Cup.

Herzo Base

Herzogenaurach was the location of a military airfield beginning in the 1930s. The airfield was originally designed as an airfield by a French architect and constructed by the Deutsche Luftwaffe (Air Force), named Deutsche Fliegerschule (German pilot school). Initially, the post was limited in its use as a Hitler youth training school due to limitations imposed by the Versailles Treaty after World War I.

However, fighter pilots soon began training in civilian clothing. In March 1936, the Luftwaffe took official control. The airfield was mainly used as a fuelling point for aircraft providing air cover for troops during the invasion of Austria and Czechoslovakia. On 9 November of each year, planes took off from the airfield to fly over the party rallies staged at Zeppelinwiese (Soldier's Field) in Nuremberg.

During the Western Allied invasion of Germany in April 1945, the United States Third Army seized the airfield. It was designated as ALG R-29. It was first occupied by a transportation unit followed by the USAAF 354th Fighter Group in May. In May 1946, the 2nd Radio Corps took over the installation and renamed it ""Herzo Base"". In 1947 the base was occupied by the U.S. Army Security Agency up until 1971, when it was replaced by the 210th Field Artillery Group (re-designated as the 210th Field Artillery Brigade on 16 September 1980) which occupied Herzo Base until 1992. Then Herzo Base was included in the base closure plan. On 4 August 1992, the installation was officially returned to the German Government.     It has since served as a civilian recreational airfield,  with ICAO code EDQH.

International relations

Herzogenaurach is twinned with:
*  Wolfsberg, Austria, since 1968
*  Kaya, Burkina Faso, since 1972
*  Nova Gradiška, Croatia, since 1980
*  Sainte-Luce-sur-Loire, France, since 1988

Spode China
Overview eBay Auctions Show & Tell Articles
Josiah Spode founded his Spode pottery around 1770 at Stroke-on-Trent in Staffordshire. Even before Spode arrived, this area was well known as “The Potteries,” one of Britain’s most important districts for the production of porcelain.
In 1785, Spode began producing its line of blue-on-pearl china , which was to become its first success thanks to the skill of designer Thomas Minton in the early 1790s. Spode’s pieces were distinctive for the depth and richness of their blue color—the pottery refined its own cobalt to achieve the effect. This blue-and-white china remained one of Spode’s most distinctive products for decades to come, though Spode also produced a variety of unglazed lines, including basalts, redwares, and canewares.
When Josiah Spode passed away, his son, Josiah Spode II, took over the business in 1797. Spode II continued the research his father had begun into bone-ash porcelain. Potteries had experimented with adding burnt animal bone to their porcelain for a few decades, but Spode II perfected the proportions of this mix between 1797 and 1798.
A mix of between 33 and 50 percent burnt animal bone, plus equal amounts of feldspar and quartz, yielded porcelain that was extremely white, strong, cheap to produce, and translucent. This bone-ash, or soft-paste, porcelain soon spread to other British potteries, giving England the boost it needed to stay competitive in the international market. By 1820, Spode’s approach to porcelain became the standard formula for bone china . Spode’s porcelain pieces often featured elaborate painted decorations, sometimes with exotic or foreign characters in novel scenes.
With the popularity of its bone-ash porcelain, Spode became the most successful Staffordshire pottery from 1800 to 1833. Its pieces had few flaws compared to the products of other companies—its glaze did not craze, its colors did not flake. Spode produced a wide variety of lines, including tea wares, dinner wares, and dessert wares, alongside incense burners, pen trays, cabinet pieces, and more. Master decorator Henry Daniel fostered high-quality designs on Spode’s polychromatic and gilded pieces, and C. F. Hürten painted many exquisite vases.
Each Spode piece was marked with the family name alongside a pattern number in red. This pattern number started at 1 in 1800—by 1833, it had reached 5000. Pattern #1166 is particularly noteworthy for its elaborate decoration. Other noteworthy pattern lines included Willow, which was first developed by Josiah Spode I around 1790; Tower; Camilla; and London, which was copied by many other makers between 1815 and 1825. Spode also produced imitation Chinese wares. Before 1805, these pieces featured a “Spode Stone China” mark alongside a fake Chinese seal.
In 1833, William Taylor Copeland took the reins at Spode after Josiah Spode III died, and he renamed the company Copeland and Garrett. In 1847, Copeland and Garrett became W. T. ...Copeland, and then W. T. Copeland and Sons in 1867. During this period, the company began producing Parian ware, its line of statuary porcelain busts and figures.
These small-scale figures were inspired by (and sometimes simply replicated) classical sculptures from ancient Greece and Rome, and they were finished to resemble marble. These affordable pieces allowed the general public to bring fine classical art into their homes. Copeland displayed these figures at the 1851 London Great Exhibition, where they were extremely successful and popular. Alongside the Parian figures, Copeland continued to produce fine bone china and earthenware.
Copeland’s production facilities remained at Spode’s original Staffordshire location. In 1970, the company’s name changed back to Spode Ltd., which became Royal Worcester Spode Ltd. in 1976. Royal Worcester Spode experienced severe financial difficulties in the 2000s and was purchased by Portmeirion in April 2009. Portmeirion has continued to use the Royal Worcester Spode name in its product line.

Henley on Todd Regatta – August each Year
September 19, 2015 by admin Leave a Comment
The race is held annually in the dry sandy bed of the Todd River
Henley on Todd Regatta (also called the Todd River Race) is a “boat” race held annually (normally the third Saturday in August) in the typically dry sandy bed of the Todd River in Alice Springs. It began and continues cautiously as a joke at the expense of the original British settlers and the formal atmosphere of the British river races which continue today.
Every year in the spring, around September, the town holds the Henley on Todd Regatta where large numbers of locals and tourists attend. Food and drink are sold at stalls, “no fishing” signs are put up, and the celebration takes all day. It is the only dry river regatta in the world; thus, it is the only regatta ever cancelled because of wet weather and there was actually water in the river. This happened in 1993, when the event was cancelled for the year due to flooding.
Boats are driven by teams armed with flour bombs and water cannons
“Boats” are made from metal frames and hung with banners and advertisements, and teams of “rowers” run their boats in races through the hot sand. Races are also held in washtubs, human-sized mouse wheels and at the final event, modified trucks decked out as boats are driven by teams armed with flour bombs and water cannon. Many bystanders end up as casualties of the final battle. Traditional Henley on Todd Regatta teams include Pirates and Vikings, complete with costumes. Who wins the final battle can be difficult to determine; even the announcers occasionally get a blast.
The Henley on Todd Regatta is run entirely by volunteers from the three Rotary Clubs in Alice Springs. Over the years well in excess of  a million dollars has been raised for local, national and international humanitarian projects.
“The Territory’s longest running iconic event!”

Passage:
Chris Andrews (singer)
Christopher Frederick ""Chris"" Andrews (born 15 October 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, whose musical career started in the late 1950s.   

Career

Andrews was born in Romford, Essex, England, and by his mid teens had formed his own group, Chris Ravel and the Ravers,  and was playing at Soho venues which included the 2i's Coffee Bar and Flamingo Nightclub. On 14 March 1959, he made his British television debut, performing on the Oh, Boy! show. He would later return in April to perform a cover of Cliff Richard's, ""Move It"".

For Adam Faith, Andrews wrote ""The First Time"" (No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart, 1963)  and ""We Are in Love"" (No. 11, 1964), and then a string of hits for Sandie Shaw. They included ""Girl Don't Come"" (No. 3, 1964/65), ""I'll Stop at Nothing"" (No. 4, 1965), ""Message Understood"" (No. 6, 1965) and ""Long Live Love"" (No. 1, 1965). The latter remained a chart topper in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks.  ""Girl Don't Come"" was covered by Cher on her debut album, All I Really Want to Do. 

Also in 1965, Andrews as a solo artist, got to No. 3 in the same listings with ""Yesterday Man"",  which peaked in Germany at No. 1 for four weeks;  followed up with a No. 13 hit in the UK ""To Whom It Concerns"".  The instrumental section of this song was used as the theme for RTÉ's long-running TV programme, The Late Late Show, until 1999, and a re-arranged version returned as the show's theme music in September 2009. As well as obtaining a high placing in the UK chart with ""Yesterday Man"", it also climbed to No. 1 in Ireland and Germany. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.  Later releases were not as successful, but his own hits are seen as early examples of reggae influenced white pop music. Although his chart appearances dwindled in Britain by 1966, his chart topping success continued in mainland Europe for a number of years, particularly in Germany, and Andrews often recorded in foreign languages.

In South Africa, his later single releases proved particularly popular,  with ""Pretty Belinda"" (1969), ""Carol OK"" and ""Brown Eyes"" (both 1970) all topping the charts there. ""Yo Yo"" reached No. 7 at the end of 1970.

Andrews remains active in his career as a singer-songwriter, working primarily in continental Europe and in the United Kingdom. He lives with his second wife Alexandra, who is also his manager, in Germany and Spain.

The original version was sung by Cliff Edwards in the character of Jiminy Cricket, and is heard over the opening credits and in the final scene of the film. The song has since become the representative song of The Walt Disney Company. It won the 1940 Academy Award for Best Original Song. It is one of only four Disney animated film songs to appear on the list, the others being ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and ""Hakuna Matata"" from The Lion King. In Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway the song is played on television every Christmas Eve in the traditional Disney one-hour Christmas cabaret From All of Us to All of You. In 1986, Linda Ronstadt recorded the classic song for her Platinum-certified album For Sentimental Reasons. It peaked at #32 in Billboard Magazine at year's end. The Library of Congress deemed the song ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and preserved it into the National Recording Registry in 2009. In the 1950s and 1960s, Walt Disney used the song in the opening sequences of all the Walt Disney anthology television series – including the opening of Walt Disney Pictures. It has also been used to accompany all editions of the Disney anthology series of The Disney Company – including all the opening episodes of The Wonderful World of Disney. It was also the first Disney song to win an Oscar. In 1978, Gene Simmons, the bassist and co-vocalist of hard rock band Kiss, covered the song for his Platinum-Certified Gene Simmons solo album because he related to the song and was a fan of Disney movies. In 2011, Brian Wilson also covered it on his album In the Key of Disney, which was released on October 25, 2011,    The WaltDisney icon has become an icon of The 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. In Japan, Sweden,. Finland, Norway, and Denmark, the song has become a Christmas song, often referring to the Star of Bethlehem. The Swedish language version is called Ser du stjärnan i det blå, roughly translated: ""Do you see the star in the blue"", and the Danish title is ""Når du ser et stjerneskud"" The song has been performed by artists including Louis Armstrong, June Christy, Dave Brubeck Quartet, Glenn Miller, Harry James, Joe Pass, the Keith Jarrett Trio, The Manhattan Transfer, Sun Ra, Jason Becker and Bill Evans. The ships of the Disney Cruise Line use the first seven notes of the song's melody as their horn signals. Many productions at Disney theme parks – particularly fireworks shows and parades – employ the song. The owner of the rights to the song, Bourne Co. Music Publishers, sued Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., Fox Broadcasting Company, Fuzzy Door Productions, Cartoon Network, Walter Murphy and Seth MacFarlane to try to stop distribution of a 2003 Family Guy episode entitled ""When You Wish upon a Weinstein"" that parodies the song in a version called ""I Need a Jew"" A federal judge ruled against BourneCo, stating that a parody of thesong did not infringe on the company's copyright. The Eel (film) is a 1997 film directed by Shohei Imamura and starring Kōji Yakusho, Misa Shimizu, Mitsuko Baisho, and Akira Emoto. The film is loosely based on the novel On Parole by celebrated author Akira Yoshimura, combined with elements from the director's 1966 film The Pornographers. It shared the Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival with Taste of Cherry. It also won the 1998 Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film of the Year. The song is featured in the film's soundtrack, which includes a version of ""I Wish Upon A Star"" by Thelonious Monk and a cover of ""My Fair Lady"" by Aretha Franklin. The movie was released in Japan on November 14, 1997, and was released worldwide on November 15, 1998. The soundtrack was released on DVD on November 16, 1998, and on Blu-ray on November 17, 1998 and on CD on November 18, 1998 (and on cassette on November 19, 1998). The soundtrack has been released in the UK and the U.S. since 1998. It is available for download on iTunes, Amazon, and Google Play. The track is available in English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. It has been recorded by several artists, including Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk, and has been a jazz standard since the 1960s. The music video for the song was recorded in the 1970s and 1980s. It was released as a single in the United States in the early 1990s. In French, a brochette is a skewer, and foods cooked on a. skewer are said to be en brochete. The word has been adopted into the English language, and English speakers usually interpret “brochette’ to refer to food which has been cooked. in a French style. In some parts of the American south, especially Louisiana, many types of brochettes are available, an enduring testimony to the French cultural influence in these areas. In Greece, it is known as souvlaki, while Thais call it satay and many Middle Easterners know it as kabob. Many cuisines around the world have some version of the Brochette. It is a common inclusion at a buffet, and may be served on its own, sometimes with a dipping sauce, or it may be part of a larger plate, as is the case with rice or pasta. It can also be made at home, and is available in some French restaurants as well, and it can be made in other countries as well as in the U.S. The core of any brochettes is, of course, the skewer. It's a small, usually rubber-headed hammer used alone or with a pleximeter in examination or diagnosis by percussion. Also called percussor or plexor plex·or (plěk'sər) or ples·sor (PLěs’�’r), it is used in percussion of the chest and testing reflexes. It has been used to test the reflexes of humans and other animals, including eels, frogs, lizards, and other small animals. It was also used in the construction of the Statue of Liberty, which was built in 17th century New York City. It still has the same name, but has been replaced by the current name of the Japanese island of Honshu, which is also known as Hokkaido, in Japan. It also has a different meaning in the Philippines, where it is called the Honshui language. It means “a small hammer with a soft rubber head or the like” or “an instrument for percussion.” It can be used for percussion of any kind, such as to test reflexes or to measure the strength of a muscle or tendon. It’s also used to measure blood pressure, and to test blood sugar, for example, or to check for anemia. Radetzky March, Op. 228, is a march composed by Johann Strauss Sr. and dedicated to Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky von Radetz. First performed on 31 August 1848 in Vienna, it soon became quite popular among regimented marching soldiers. Strauss used an older folk melody called Alter Tanz aus Wien or Tinerl-Lied (Tinerl was a popular Viennese songstress of the day) which was originally in 3/4 time. It is traditionally played as the last piece at the New Year's Concert (Neujahrskonzert) of the Vienna Philharmonic. In 2001, under conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the orchestra performed both the original and the convert version. Since 1896, this has been the official presentation march of the Chilean Army's Military School of the Liberator Bernardo O'Higgins. The 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards of the United Kingdom adopted the Radetzki March as its regimental quick march. The Sri Lanka Armoured Corps, whose practices and traditions are based on those of the 1st the Queen'sDragoon Guards, also use the Radetzky March as their regimentalquick march. For a very basic marinade, try mixing olive oil, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, finely chopped onions, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Cut the food into evenly sized chunks, and marinate it for at least half an hour before putting it on skewers. Cook the skewers using your method of choice, and serve warm with slices of lemon or tomato.

To make a Brochette in a bowl, make sure you have plenty of salt, pepper, and sugar. Candy corn was created in the 1880s by George Renninger of the Philadelphia, PA-based Wunderle Candy Company. The National Confectioners Association estimates that 20 million pounds (just over 9072 metric tons) of candy corn are sold annually. The three colors of the candy – a broad yellow end, a tapered orange center, and a pointed white tip – mimic the appearance of kernels of corn. Each piece is approximately three times the size of a real kernel from a ripe or dried ear. In 2011, there were caramel apple and apple candy corn variants, and in 2013 there were s'mores and pumpkin spice variants. In 2014, the Easter season offered carrot cake type flavor variants, typically having green and orange, and having a carrot cake-type tip. The Somerset Bowls Association (SBA) was founded in 2009 upon the unification of the two historic single gender County Associations. The men's association (men) had been founded in 1914 whilst the Somerset Ladies County Bowling Association came into being in 1928. The ladies association (ladies) were founded in 1928 and are still in existence today. The Middleton Cup – Sponsored by Northavon M&E – Somerset – is held every year. The winner of the tournament is crowned the winner of Somerset's version of the World Series of Bowls (WSB). The WSB is held in Somerset and is open to men and women of all ages and skill levels. The SBA is based in the town of Somerset, Somerset, England and is run by the Somerset County Bowls Club (SCC). The SBC is a non-profit organization that promotes bowling in the Somerset area. The WBC was founded by the Somerset County Council in 1903 and is based at the Somerset Bowling Club in Somerset, Wales. It is the oldest bowling club in the UK. It has been in existence since 1903 and has a membership of around 2,000 members. It was founded to promote the sport of bowling in Somerset. It also serves as a training ground for the SBC's women's team. The club is also home to the Somerset Women's Bowling Club, which was formed in the late 1950s. The women's association was founded on the same site as the men's and was established in the early 1960s. In the 1970s, the WBC became the first women's bowling association in the United States. The Sandwich tern (T. sandvicensis) is a seabird of the tern family, Sternidae. It is a medium-large tern with grey upperparts, white underparts, a yellow-tipped black bill and a shaggy black crest which becomes less extensive in winter with a white crown. Young birds bear grey and brown scalloped plumage on their backs and wings. It nests in a ground scrape and lays one to three eggs. It has been known to interbreed with the lesser crested tern and has no subspecies. It feeds by plunge diving for fish, usually in marine environments, and the offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display. It breeds in very dense colonies on coasts and islands, and exceptionally breeds in exceptionally dense colonies. It was originally described by ornithologist John Latham in 1787 as Sterna Sandvicensis, but was recently moved to its current genus Thalasseus (Boie, 1822) It is unlikely to be confused within most of its range, although the South American race could be confused with the elegant tern. The terns, family Sternidae, are small to medium-sized seabirds, gull-like in appearance, but usually with a more delicate, lighter build and shorter, weaker legs. They have long, pointed wings, which gives them a fast buoyant flight, and often a deeply forked tail. Most species are grey above and white below, and have a black cap which is reduced or flecked with white in the winter. The species was first described from Hawaii, formerly known as the ""Sandwich Islands"", but it does not occur there. The current genus name is derived from Greek Thalassa, ""sea"", and sandvicenses, like the English name, refers to Sandwich, Kent, Latham's type locality. It does not overlap in range with Sandwich terns so confusion is unlikely. Juvenile roseate terns have their tails on their tails, like their back and wings, like a scaly appearance their call is a loud, keikarating or ink-errating kerrarating bird; its call is characteristic of a vocal bird. The adult tern's forehead becomes white in winter and its bill is black with a yellow tip, except in the yellow or orange billed South America race. The Sandwich tern has an extensive global range estimated at 100,000 –. It has a population estimated at 460,000–500,000 individuals. It nests in a ground scrape and lays one to three eggs. Unlike some of the smaller white terns, it is not very aggressive toward potential predators. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display. It feeds by plunge-diving for fish, almost invariably from the sea. It usually dives directly, and not from the ""stepped-hover"" favoured by Arctic terns. It is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as least concern. It can be found in Britain and Ireland at the National Museum of Natural History in London, and in the UK at the Natural History Museum in Edinburgh, Scotland, and the UK’s Museum of Nature and Science in Glasgow, Scotland and the University of Cambridge in Scotland. The bird can also be found at the U.S. National Zoo in Washington, D.C. and the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Canada and the Canadian National Museum in Ottawa. The species is not considered a threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) It is listed as a species of conservation concern by the IUKN. The U.N. Red List lists the species as of least concern, with a population of 460,00 – 500,000. It also lists it as one of the taxa to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. The AEWA calls for parties to engage in a wide range of conservation actions which are described in a detailed action plan. The plan should address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation. It should also address key issue such as population conservation, conservation of fish and habitat, and conservation of the sea environment. The Sandwich Tern is one of three species of bird in the Thalasseus genus. The other two are the Little Whiskered Tern and the Arctic Tern. It lives in freshwater lakes close to the coast. It lays one-to-three eggs and is not aggressive toward predators, relying on the sheer density of the nests and nesting close to other more aggressive species to avoid predation.

Her pioneering playbook for turning scandal into profits remains the gold standard in American pop culture to this day. Herzogenaurach (East Franconian: Herziaura) is a town in the district of Erlangen-Höchstadt, in Bavaria, Germany. It is best known for being the home of the sporting goods companies Adidas and Puma, as well as the large car parts manufacturer Schaeffler Group. St. Bernard of Menthon (1020-1081) is the patron saint of mountaineers. He founded a canony and hospice at the highet point of the pass, 8,000 feet above sea-level, in the year 1050, at the site which has came to bear his name. The traditional route of this pass is covered with perpetual snow from seven to eight feet deep, and drifts sometimes accumulate to the height of forty feet. He died on June 1081 in the Imperial Free City of Novara and was interred in the monastery of St. Lawrence. He is buried in the church of St Lawrence in Novara, Italy, near the town of Aosta in the Piedmont region of Italy. He was buried in a grave made of stone and surrounded by his family's possessions, including his wife and two children. His funeral was held on June 14, 1081, at St Lawrence’s Church in the city of Novaro. The feast day of St Bernard is June 14. The saint is celebrated in Italy every year on the anniversary of his death. For more information, visit: www.st Bernardofmenthon.org and www.saint-bernard-of-menth-on-org.org.

The site is located in the Middleconia area of Bavaria and is about 23km or 14 miles northwest of Nuremberg on the river Aurach. Herzogenaurach was the location of a military airfield beginning in the 1930s. It was first occupied by a transportation unit followed by the USAAF 354th Fighter Group in May. In 1947 the base was occupied by the U.S. Army Security Agency up until 1971, when it was replaced by the 210th Field Artillery Group. On 4 August 1992, the installation was officially returned to the German Government. It has since served as a civilian recreational airfield, with ICAO code EDQH. The airfield was mainly used as a fuelling point for aircraft providing air cover for troops during the invasion of Austria and Czechoslovakia. In March 1936, the Luftwaffe took official control of the airfield. In May 1946, the 2nd Radio Corps took over the installation and renamed it ""Herzo Base"". In May 1947, the post was limited in its use as a Hitler youth training school due to limitations imposed by the Versailles Treaty after World War I. In July 1947, it was designated as the Deutsche Fliegerschule (German pilot school). In July 1957, it became known as “The Potteries,” one of Britain’s most important districts for the production of porcelain. In August 1958, the city was given the name of Uraha when Holy Roman Emperor Henry II granted the town to the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg. The city was named after the town of the same name, which means ‘Uraha’ in German and “Bamberg” in English. It is located on the banks of the Aurach River, which is a tributary of the River Rhine. The town is home to two sporting goods giants: Adidas and Puma. Both companies’ headquarters are still located in the town on opposite sides of the river. For years, the companies would not associate and even when Adolf and Rudi died, they were buried in opposite ends of the town Cemetery. The name of the company is ‘Adidas’ and ‘Puma’ means “sportswear’ or ‘sporting goods’. The company was founded in 1785 and is now based in Herzogenaurac, Germany. It produces high-end athletic shoes, including the popular “Adidas Shoe’ brand. Spode was the most successful Staffordshire pottery from 1800 to 1833. Its bone-ash, or soft-paste, porcelain soon spread to other British potteries. Spode produced a wide variety of lines, including tea wares, dinner wares and dessert wares. Henley on Todd Regatta (also called the Todd River Race) is a “boat race held annually in the typically dry sandy bed of theTodd River’s dry sandy river bed” (normally the third Saturday in August) It began and continues as a joke at the expense of the original British settlers and the formal atmosphere of the British river races.

Master decorator Henry Daniel fostered high-quality designs on Spode’S polychromatic and gilded pieces, and C. Hürten painted many exquisite vases. The Henley on Todd Regatta is run entirely by volunteers from the three Rotary Clubs in Alice Springs. Over the years well in excess of  a million dollars has been raised for local, national and international humanitarian projects. It is the only regatta ever cancelled because of wet weather and there was actually water in the river, as happened in 1993 when it was cancelled for the year due to flooding.

Calcium plays an essential role in blood clotting. Photo Credit boiling blood image by Adrian Hillman from <a href=""http://www.fotolia.com"">Fotolia.com</a>
Your body uses calcium not only to keep teeth and bones strong, but also to enable muscles to contract, to assist in the transmission of neural impulses and to maintain cell membrane stability and permeability. It is also an important part of the blood clotting process and because your body is unable to generate calcium, it is important that you have adequate daily intake.
The Clotting Process
Whenever your skin becomes broken, the sticky platelets contained in the blood form clots to stop blood flow. Calcium works together with vitamin K and a protein called fibrinogen in the clotting cascade. Without adequate levels of calcium and vitamin K, blood will take longer to clot, and if both nutrients are missing you might bleed to death. Most people gain enough calcium and vitamin K from their diets, but in some cases supplements may be prescribed.
The Clotting Cascade
As soon as blood from a wound is exposed to the air, the platelets disintegrate and react with fibrinogen to create fibrin: a mass of tiny threads. This triggers a whole series of reactions that rely on adequate levels of calcium and vitamin K to work. The fibrin hardens very quickly to form a scab over the wound.
Foods that Contain Calcium
Spinach and other dark green vegetables contain high levels of calcium. Photo Credit Blattspinat image by Yvonne Bogdanski from Fotolia.com
Low-fat dairy products such as milk, yogurt and cheese contain a lot of calcium, and you will also find calcium in dried beans, tofu, spinach, broccoli and dark green vegetables. Certain cereals, vegan dairy substitutes and juices may be fortified with it. You must get an adequate daily intake of vitamin D to assist your body's absorption of calcium, so make sure that if you take calcium supplements, they contain vitamin D as well.
Recommended Intake
Adults under the age of 50 need around 1,000 mg calcium each day while older adults need around 1,200 mg each day. Children and adolescents need a higher intake of calcium because they grow rapidly. Those under 10 should get around 400 to 800 mg each day and those aged 11 to 24 need around 1,200 to 1,500 mg every day.
Do I Need Extra Calcium?
Most people gain enough calcium from their diet, but if you don't you could be prescribed dietary supplements. Photo Credit Fallen brown bottle of last yellow pills isolated on white image by Olga Sapegina from Fotolia.com
Most people gain enough calcium by eating a healthy and varied diet, but those at risk include menopausal women who may be at risk of rapid bone loss, vegetarians and those who are lactose intolerant because they may not be getting enough calcium from their diets. If you feel that you may be at risk contact your family physician.
Meeting Your Calcium Needs
Some cereals are fortified with calcium. Photo Credit rural life(cereals) image by Aleksandr Popov from Fotolia.com
If you have been told that you need to increase your calcium intake, try using low-fat or fat-free milk to make mashed potatoes, puddings and smoothies. Add low-fat or fat-free cheese to meals or try calcium-fortified tofu with fried vegetables or meat. Include other calcium-fortified foods such as cereals and drinks in your diet.

Philosopher
A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theological dogma or science.  The term ""philosopher"" comes from the Ancient Greek  (philosophos) meaning ""lover of wisdom"". Its origination has been ascribed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras. 

In the classical sense, a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life, focusing on resolving existential questions about the human condition, and not someone who discourses upon theories or comments upon authors.  Typically, these particular brands of philosophy are Hellenistic ones and those who most arduously commit themselves to this lifestyle may be considered philosophers.

In a modern sense, a philosopher is an intellectual who has contributed in one or more branches of philosophy, such as aesthetics, ethics, epistemology, logic, metaphysics, social theory, and political philosophy. A philosopher may also be one who worked in the humanities or other sciences which have since split from philosophy proper over the centuries, such as the arts, history, economics, sociology, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, theology, and politics. 

History

Ancient Greece and Rome

The separation of philosophy and science from theology began in Greece during the 6th century BC.  Thales, an astronomer and mathematician, was considered by Aristotle to be the first philosopher of the Greek tradition. 

While Pythagoras coined the word, the first known elaboration on the topic was conducted by Plato. In his Symposium, he concludes that Love is that which lacks the object it seeks. Therefore, the philosopher is one who seeks wisdom; if he attains wisdom, he would be a sage. Therefore, the philosopher in antiquity was one who lives in the constant pursuit of wisdom, and living in accordance to that wisdom.  Disagreements arose as to what living philosophically entailed. These disagreements gave rise to different Hellenistic schools of philosophy. In consequence, the ancient philosopher thought in a tradition.  As the ancient world became schism by philosophical debate, the competition lay in living in manner that would transform his whole way of living in the world. 

Among the last of these philosophers was Marcus Aurelius, who is widely regarded as a philosopher in the modern sense, but personally refused to call himself by such a title, since he had a duty to live as an emperor. 

Transition

According to the Classicist Pierre Hadot, the modern conception of a philosopher and philosophy developed predominately through three changes:

The first is the natural inclination of the philosophical mind. Philosophy is a tempting discipline which can easily carry away the individual in analyzing the universe and abstract theory. 

The second is the historical change through the Medieval era. With the rise of Christianity, the philosophical way of life was adopted by its theology. Thus, philosophy was divided between a way of life and the conceptual, logical, physical and metaphysical materials to justify that way of life. Philosophy was then the servant to theology.Pierre Hadot, Philosophy as a Way of Life, trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. pg. 32: Introduction: Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy by Arnold I. Davidson.

The third is the sociological need with the development of the university. The modern university requires professionals to teach. Maintaining itself requires teaching future professionals to replace the current faculty. Therefore, the discipline degrades into a technical language reserved for specialists, completely eschewing its original conception as a way of life.

Medieval era

In the fourth century, the word philosopher began to designate a man or woman who led a monastic life. Gregory of Nyssa, for example, describes how his sister Macrina persuaded their mother to forsake ""the distractions of material life"" for a life of philosophy. 

Later during the Middle Ages, persons who engaged with alchemy was called a philosopher - thus, the Philosopher's Stone. 

Early Modern era

Many philosophers still emerged from the Classical tradition, as saw their philosophy as a way of life. Among the most notable are René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Nicolas Malebranche, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. With the rise of the university, the modern conception of philosophy became more prominent. Many of the esteemed philosophers of the eighteenth century and onward have attended, taught, and developed their works in university. Early examples include: Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. 

After these individuals, the Classical conception had all but died with the exceptions of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. The last considerable figure in philosophy to not have followed a strict and orthodox academic regime was Ludwig Wittgenstein. 

Modern academia

In the modern era, those attaining advanced degrees in philosophy often choose to stay in careers within the educational system. According to a 1993 study by the National Research Council (as reported by the American Philosophical Association), 77.1% of the 7,900 holders of a Ph.D. in philosophy who responded were employed in educational institutions (academia). Outside of academia, philosophers may employ their writing and reasoning skills in other careers, such as medicine, bioethics, business, publishing, free-lance writing, media, and law.

Prizes in philosophy

Various prizes in philosophy exist. Among the most prominent are:
*Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy
*Rolf Schock Prizes
*Avicenna Prize

Certain esteemed philosophers, such as Henri Bergson, Bertrand Russell, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre, have also won the Nobel Prize in Literature.

The John W. Kluge Prize for the Study of Humanity, created by the Library of Congress to recognize work not covered by the Nobel Prizes, was given to philosophers Leszek Kołakowski in 2003, Paul Ricoeur in 2004, and Jürgen Habermas and Charles Taylor in 2015.

444 Club | Susquehanna Greenway
444 Club | Susquehanna Greenway
February 2014
Story by Rick Hiduk, courtesy of EMHR.
Few activities beat the serenity that a paddle on the Susquehanna River can provide. In just three months, the ice will have cleared from the 444-mile waterway that is part of the National Park System, and paddlers and fishers will once again set in for much-anticipated recreation. For paddlers who have traversed all or most of the North Branch and main stem of the river, a newly created 444 Club pin is great way to acknowledge a journey that is often years in the making.
Avid paddlers of the Susquehanna River have long marked their progress at traversing the 444 miles of the North Branch that flows through Pennsylvania and covers smaller portions of New York and Maryland. Many have highlighted completed sections of the river on maps, kept notes on journals, or recorded their journeys with photos and video clips.
The new 444 Club was initiated by the Endless Mountains Heritage Region (EMHR) Water Trails Committee to acknowledge those individual's efforts as they seek the elusive benchmark.
Endless Mountain Outfitters (EMO) owner and EMHR board member David Buck credits lifetime recreationists like Cindy Dunn, Rick Shumaker, Scott Arnold, and inaugural 444 member Bill Gibson for suggesting the formation of the club, as well as Judy Lorincz of Mehoopany, who completed her 444 Club personal goal of paddling the entire river a few years ago. A number of people notched some of the 444 miles last year after paddling with EMO from Great Bend, PA through Binghamton, NY to the French Azilum Historic Site in Bradford County.
Dunn is one of those who thinks that the formation of the 444 Club will provide an incentive to get new paddlers on the river and bring long-time recreationists back to the waterway. ""This is a great idea that makes me want to paddle the whole 444 again,"" she remarked, noting that her first week-long sojourn on the Susquehanna began on the North Branch. ""That is where I got totally hooked on the Susquehanna,"" Dunn related.
For Dunn and many other like her, paddling the Susquehanna River is a spiritual experience. ""Look up at the Wyalusing cliffs from my canoe, I half expected to see an American Indian,"" she stated, The portal to pre-European settlement makes her wonder ""How many Indians gazed at the river from this vantage?"" and ""What did the landscape look like then?""
Dunn's favorite stretch of the river is the Vosburg Neck in Wyoming County, with sharp cliffs on one side and verdant forest on the other. ""I never fail to hear lots of bird song when I paddle through here,"" she related, adding that she has seen several Eagles in the Vosburg area.
The winding river is almost addictive, Dunn explains. During her sojourn through the Endless Mountains, ""the views were so enticing as I paddled down each reach."" She had to know what was around the next bend.
It is hoped that members who receive the pins will be able to provide guidance to recreationists following in their wake as each plans to tackle new stretches of the river, which meanders along the borderline of New York and Pennsylvania before running from the Endless Mountains through Pennsylvania to the Chesapeake Bay near Havre de Grace, MD.

A Year in Provence
A Year in Provence is a 1989 best-selling memoir by Peter Mayle about his first year in Provence, and the local events and customs.  It was adapted into a television mini-series starring John Thaw and Lindsay Duncan. Reviewers praised the book's honest style, wit[http://french.about.com/library/reviews/aafpr-yearinprovence.htm A Year in Provence, by Peter Mayle] and its refreshing humour.  The book was turned into an equally popular radio version.

Plot

Peter Mayle and his wife move to Provence, and are soon met with unexpectedly fierce weather, underground truffle dealers and unruly workers, who work around their normalement schedule.  Meals in Provençal restaurants and work on the Mayles' house, garden and vineyard are features of the book, whose chapters follow the months of the year.

Mini-series

In 1993, the BBC produced a television mini-series based on the book, starring Lindsay Duncan and John Thaw, with appearances from Alfred Molina and James Fleet amongst others. Unlike the book, the miniseries was
not well received by critics; A Year in Provence was later placed at number ten on a Radio Times list of 
the worst television programs ever made   
  with the writer, John Naughton, describing
it as the """"smugathon"" series A Year In Provence "" and stated it ""achieved the near impossible - creating a John Thaw vehicle nobody liked"".

Shiv now most capped West Indies Test player
WICB Press Release - Wednesday, July 6th, 2011 at 1:23 PM
Chanderpaul
Roseau, Dominica – Shivnarine Chanderpaul celebrated another special milestone in his outstanding career on Wednesday when he appeared in his 133rd Test match, to become the most capped West Indies Test cricketer. The 36-year-old left-hander is in the line-up for the Third Digicel Test match against India – the first ever Test at Windsor Park.
Chanderpaul made his Test debut as a 19-year-old back in 1994 and has been a reliable member of the team since then. He surpassed fast bowling great Courtney Walsh, who made 132 Test appearances. Third on the West Indies all-time list is another legend Brian Lara, who played 131 Tests.
Before the start of the match Chanderpaul was congratulated by the entire team at a brief ceremony in front the Billy Doctrove Pavilion and was also cheered by the spectators. Also, to mark the occasion, Chanderpaul presented first Test caps to debutants Kieran Powell and Kirk Edwards.
Chanderpaul was delighted. “It feels good to reach this landmark. I just want to keep doing my best in every match.”
West Indies Team Manager Richie Richardson and Batting Consultant Desmond Haynes were both members of the team when Chanderpaul played his first Test against England at Bourda in Guyana more than 17 years ago.
“This is a tremendous milestone, he has done very well and to reach 133 Test matches is truly remarkable,”  Haynes said in paying tribute.
Richardson added: “When Shiv first came into the team years back you could see the desire to play for a long time. He has worked hard over the years and it is great to see him reaching this landmark.”
Chanderpaul has had an outstanding career, scoring 9228 runs at an average of 48.56 with 22 centuries before Wednesday.

Passage:
Tail
The tail is the section at the rear end of an animal's body; in general, the term refers to a distinct, flexible appendage to the torso. It is the part of the body that corresponds roughly to the sacrum and coccyx in mammals, reptiles, and birds. While tails are primarily a feature of vertebrates, some invertebrates including scorpions and springtails, as well as snails and slugs, have tail-like appendages that are sometimes referred to as tails. Tailed objects are sometimes referred to as ""caudate"" and the part of the body associated with or proximal to the tail are given the adjective ""caudal"".

Function

Animal tails are used in a variety of ways. They provide a source of locomotion for fish and some other forms of marine life.  Many land animals use their tails to brush away flies and other biting insects.  Some species, including cats and kangaroos, use their tails for balance;   and some, such as New World monkeys and opossums, have what are known as prehensile tails, which are adapted to allow them to grasp tree branches. 

Tails are also used for social signaling. Some deer species flash the white underside of their tails to warn other nearby deer of possible danger,  beavers slap the water with their tails to indicate danger,  and canids (including domestic dogs) indicate emotions through the positioning and movement of their tails.  Some species' tails are armored, and some, such as those of scorpions, contain venom. 

Some species of lizard can detach (""cast"") their tails from their bodies.  This can help them to escape predators, which are either distracted by the wriggling, detached tail or left with only the tail while the lizard flees. Tails cast in this manner generally grow back over time, though the replacement is typically darker in colour than the original. 

Most birds' tails end in long feathers called rectrices. These feathers are used as a rudder, helping the bird steer and maneuver in flight;  they also help the bird to balance while it is perched.   In some species—such as birds of paradise, lyrebirds, and most notably peafowl—modified tail feathers play an important role in courtship displays.   The extra-stiff tail feathers of other species, including woodpeckers and woodcreepers, allow them to brace themselves firmly against tree trunks. 

The tails of grazing animals, such as horses, are used both to sweep away insects and positioned or moved in ways that indicate the animal's physical or emotional state. 

Human tails

Human embryos have a tail that measures about one-sixth of the size of the embryo itself.  As the embryo develops into a fetus, the tail is absorbed by the growing body. Infrequently, a child is born with a ’""soft tail"", which contains no vertebrae, but only blood vessels, muscles, and nerves, but this is regarded as an abnormality rather than a vestigial true tail, even when such an appendage is located where the tail would be expected.  

Humans have a ""tail bone"" (the coccyx) attached to the pelvis, formed of fused vertebrae, usually four, at the bottom of the vertebral column. It does not protrude externally.

Product Description
The Sex Museum, Amsterdam Nobody thought it would make any money when the Sex Museum opened its doors in 1985. For the first few weeks, admission was actually free. Today, however, some 500,000 visitors to Amsterdam enter the museum every year. Perhaps it was a good omen when two ancient objects of an erotic nature turned up in the soil during excavation for the building of the museum. One of them was a cracked tile on which a card-playing man was depicted sporting an evident erection - maybe betraying the excitement of a winner. The other was a small statuette of the Greek god Hermes with a giant tumescence, probably imported from the Mediterranean by a Dutch merchant centuries ago. In their time, such figurines were not only fertility icons but also good luck charms. At the opening of the Museum, Monique van M. may well have been the youngest museum director in Europe - young enough still to depend on the support and advice of her father. The museum's contents were not particularly numerous. All that could be taken for granted in the enterprise was public interest in the erotic, whether for historical or artistic or other reasons. Museums are meant to reflect every aspect of life and culture in Europe, yet this clearly crucial part of life remains under-represented, despite the fact that artists of cultures from all over the world have created outstanding works on the subject. Simply asking a curator where the erotic art may be found in an art museum often meets with a negative response. And in any case, erotic works tend to hit museums moral blind spot .....

Passage:
Ashfield (UK Parliament constituency)
Ashfield is a Nottinghamshire constituency  represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2010 by Gloria De Piero of the Labour Party.

Constituency profile 

To date almost always a Labour Party seat which was created in 1955, Ashfield has been served by a former Secretary of State, Geoff Hoon, and since its creation for only two years has been served by one member of another party, Tim Smith of the Conservative Party, from 1977 to 1979.  Ashfield's results indicate quite large Labour majorities.  In 2010 the seat had a marginal majority of only 192, but this was increased to 8,820 in 2015.

Boundaries 

1955-1983: The Urban Districts of Hucknall, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, and Sutton-in-Ashfield, and part of the Rural District of Basford.

1983-2010: The District of Ashfield wards of Jacksdale, Kirkby-in-Ashfield Central, Kirkby-in-Ashfield East, Kirkby-in-Ashfield West, Selston, Sutton-in-Ashfield Central, Sutton-in-Ashfield East, Sutton-in-Ashfield North, Sutton-in-Ashfield West, Underwood, and Woodhouse, and the Borough of Broxtowe wards of Brinsley, Eastwood East, Eastwood North, and Eastwood South.

2010-present: The District of Ashfield wards of Jacksdale, Kirkby-in-Ashfield Central, Kirkby-in-Ashfield East, Kirkby-in-Ashfield West, Selston, Sutton-in-Ashfield Central, Sutton-in-Ashfield East, Sutton-in-Ashfield North, Sutton-in-Ashfield West, Underwood, and Woodhouse, and the Borough of Broxtowe wards of Brinsley, Eastwood North and Greasley Beauvale, and Eastwood South.

Members of Parliament 

The former Cabinet minister Geoff Hoon represented the seat for the Labour Party from 1992, when he succeeded the three-term Labour member Frank Haynes, to 2010 when he retired.  Ashfield is now represented by Gloria De Piero, who came close to losing the seat after a 17.2% swing to the Liberal Democrats in 2010 but increased her majority again in 2015.

Passage:
Nation of shopkeepers
The phrase ""a nation of shopkeepers"", commonly attributed to Napoleon, is a reference to England or the United Kingdom.  

There is reason to doubt that Napoleon ever used it.  No contemporaneous French newspaper mentions that he did.  The phrase was first used in an offensive sense by the French revolutionary Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac on June 11, 1794 in a speech to the National Convention: “Let Pitt then boast of his victory to his nation of shopkeepers”.   Later, during the Napoleonic wars, the British press mentioned the phrase, attributing it either to “the French” or to Napoleon himself.   

A later, explicit source is Barry Edward O'Meara, who was surgeon to Napoleon during his exile in St. Helena.   If O'Meara is to be believed, Napoleon said:

  There may be grounds to doubt the veracity of this account. 

The supposed French original as uttered by Napoleon (une nation de boutiquiers) is frequently cited, but it has no attestation.  O'Meara conversed with Napoleon in Italian, not French.  There is no other source.

After the war English newspapers sometimes tried to correct the impression.  For example the following article appeared in the Morning Post of 28 May 1832: 
ENGLAND A NATION OF SHOPKEEPERS
This complimentary term, for so we must consider it, as applied to a Nation which has derived its principal prosperity from its commercial greatness, has been erroneously attributed, from time to time, to all the leading Revolutionists of France.  To our astonishment we now find it applied exclusively to BONAPARTE.  Than this nothing can be further from the fact.  NAPOLEON was scarcely known at the time, he being merely an Officer of inferior rank, totally unconnected with politics.  The occasion on which that splenetic, but at the same time, complimentary observation was made was that of the ever-memorable battle of the 1st of June.  The oration delivered on that occasion was by M. BARRERE [sic], in which, after describing our beautiful country as one ""on which the sun scarce designs to shed its light"", he described England as a nation of shopkeepers.

In any case the phrase did not originate with Napoleon, or even Barère.  It first appears in a non-pejorative sense in The Wealth of Nations (1776) by Adam Smith, who wrote: 

Smith is also quoted as saying that Britain was ""a nation that is governed by shopkeepers"", which is how he put it in the first (1776) edition.  It is unlikely that either Adam Smith or Napoleon used the phrase to describe that class of small retailers who would not even have had the franchise.

The phrase may have been part of standard 18th century economic dialogue.  It has been suggested that Napoleon may have heard it during a meeting of the French Convention on 11 June 1794, when Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac quoted Smith's phrase.   But this presupposes that Napoleon himself, as opposed to Barère alone, used the phrase.

The phrase has also been attributed to Samuel Adams, but this is disputed; Josiah Tucker, Dean of Gloucester, produced a slightly different phrase in 1766:

Napoleon would have been correct in seeing the United Kingdom as essentially a commercial and naval rather than a land based power, but during his lifetime  it was fast being transformed from a mercantile to an industrial nation, a process which laid the basis for a century of British hegemony after the Battle of Waterloo.  Although the UK had half the population of France during the Napoleonic Wars,  there was a higher per capita income and, consequently, a greater tax base, necessary to conduct a prolonged war of attrition.  The United Kingdom's economy and its ability to finance the war against Napoleon also benefitted from the Bank of England's issuance of inconvertible banknotes, a ""temporary"" measure which remained from the 1790s until 1821.

Passage:
Britannia Coco-nut Dancers
The Britannia Coco-nut Dancers or Nutters are a troupe of Lancastrian clog dancers who perform every Easter in Bacup, dancing 7 mi across the town.  There are eight dancers and a whipper-in, who controls the proceedings.

History

Some say the custom was brought to the area by Moors who settled in Cornwall in the 17th century, became miners and then moved to work in quarries in Lancashire.  Similar dances – the Danse des Coco –  are performed in Provence.   This troupe was formed as the Tunstead Mill Nutters in 1857 when it was one of a group of five which performed in the Rossendale valley. According to the Burnley Gazette, a man named Abraham Spencer (1842–1918) was one of the founders back in 1857, at only 15. They passed on their tradition to workers at the Britannia Mill in the 1920s.  Their dances feature floral hoops or garlands; the musical accompaniment is provided by a concertina or the Stacksteads Silver Band.

Costume

Their name refers to the wooden nuts worn at their knees, waists and wrists, which are made from the tops of bobbins.   These are taped together like castanets as a percussive accompaniment to the dance, the nuts on the hands striking the nuts on the waist or knees in an intricate and dextrous rhythm.   They wear white turbans with blue plumes, dark jerseys and trews, a white baldric, red and white skirts, white hose and black clogs.  

Blackface

Their faces are blackened.  This is popularly explained as either due to the origins of the dance in the mining community,  a reference to the dancers' ancient origin as Barbary pirates or as a disguise to ward off evil spirits.  Theresa Buckland's (1990) research discusses the linkages between the tradition and minstrel shows.  She argued, ""The 'disguise' function of the costume has most likely been influences by Cecil Sharp's [1911] interpretation of the black face [...] which has been repeated in various publications and ephemera of the English Folk Dance and Song Society ... The dancers have been exposed to information from these publications, whether first-hand or further removed.""   The issue caused controversy in 2014, when local politician Will Straw was photographed with them.  He defended the custom: ""... it’s traditions from the past which give communities a sense of common identity for the present and the future. May the Coconutters continue for many years to come.""

Membership

One long-standing member of the troupe is Dick Shufflebottom, whose service of 50 years was celebrated in 2006 and who continued as an active member in 2013, aged 76.   The youngest member of the troupe at that time was Gavin McNulty, age 26.

Performances

The main annual performance is on Easter Saturday, but rehearsals take place weekly throughout the year and form a social occasion.  
In 2013, the annual performance was threatened by public sector austerity as the police and local authority threatened to withdraw support for the traffic management and security at the event. 

Reviews

AA Gill, writing in The Sunday Times, described them as bizarrely compelling:  

Recordings 

A five-minute black-and-white film, shot in 1930, with a new musical accompaniment, is included in the DVD Here's a Health to the Barley Mow, issued by the BFI in 2011. 

An 2-minute and 18-second excerpt of the music used for the dancing, recorded in 1972, is included on the album The Voice of the People, Volume 16: You Lazy Lot of Bone Shakers – Songs & Dance Tunes of Seasonal Events, issued by Topic Records.   Topic included this recording as Track One on the second CD in their 70-year anniversary boxed set Three Score and Ten.

It is located in the townland of Ballyhalbert on the Ards Peninsula in County Down, at longitude 5.5 miles. The term ""philosopher"" comes from the Ancient Greek  (philosophos) meaning ""lover of wisdom"". Its origination has been ascribed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras. A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theological dogma or science. In a modern sense, a philosopher is an intellectual who has contributed in one or more branches of philosophy, such as aesthetics, ethics, epistemology, logic, metaphysics, social theory, and political philosophy. The first is the inclination of the philosophical mind, which can easily carry away the individual in analyzing the universe and abstract theory. The second is the historical change through the Medieval era, which is predominately through changes in the conceptual materials and materials. The third is the modern conception of a philosopher, which was developed predominately by the modern philosopher Pierre Hadot, the first of whom coined the term. The fourth is the current conception, which has been developed by the philosopher David Hume, the father of modern science. The fifth is the idea that the world is made up of three parts: the physical, the mental, and the spiritual. The sixth is the notion that the universe is made of atoms and molecules, and that all that matters is the way we choose to look at the world. The seventh is the concept that all things are created by God, and therefore all things must be seen as good or bad, and all things can be viewed as either good or evil. The eighth is the view that all of us are created in the image of God, so that we are all created by him. The ninth is the opinion that all living things, including ourselves, are good or negative, and so we should all try to live in a way that is both good and negative. The 10th is the thought that we should try to make a difference in the world by living in a manner that would transform the world in a positive way, rather than in a negative way. The 11th and 12th are the 10th and 13th, which are the 9th and 14th, respectively. The 14th and 15th are also the 15th and 16th, and they are the 13th and 18th. The 16th and 17th, are the 18th and 19th. In the fourth century, the word philosopher began to designate a man or woman who led a monastic life. With the rise of the university, the modern conception of philosophy became more prominent. The discipline degrades into a technical language reserved for specialists, completely eschewing its original conception as a way of life. In the modern era, those attaining advanced degrees in philosophy often choose to stay in careers within the educational system. Outside of academia, philosophers may employ their writing and reasoning skills in other careers, such as medicine, bioethics, business, publishing, free-lance writing, media, and law. For paddlers who have traversed all or most of the North Branch and main stem of the Susquehanna River, a newly created 444 Club pin is a great way to acknowledge a journey that is often years in the making. The 444 Club was initiated by the Endless Mountains Heritage Region (EMHR) in Waitsfield, Pennsylvania, in February of this year. In just three months, the ice will have cleared from the 444-mile waterway that is part of the National Park System, and paddlers and fishers will once again set in for much-anticipated recreation.

The match is scheduled to start on July 6 and will be followed by the Second Test on July 7. The Third Test will be played at the same venue on July 8. The Second Test will take place on July 9 and will also be held at the Windsor Park Cricket Ground. The third Test will conclude on July 10. The Fourth Test will follow on July 11 and the fifth will be held on July 13. The fourth Test will finish on July 14 and the final will be on July 15. The last Test was played on July 12 and was won by West Indies by the hosts at St Vincent and the Grenadines. It is the first Test to be held in Dominica since the island nation became a member of the Caribbean Cricket Association (CCA) in 1998. The first Test was held at St. Vincent and The Grenadine was held between July 4 and July 5, 1998. It was the last Test held in the Caribbean before the Caribbean became part of the CCCA. The second Test will also take place in St. Lucia on July 16 and July 17, 2008. The final Test is scheduled for July 18 and July 19, 2008, at the St. James’ Park Cricket Club in Antigua. It will be the first time the Caribbean has hosted the third Test in the island’s history. It has been played in the same ground as the second Test, which was played in 1998 and 2008. Most birds' tails end in long feathers called rectrices. Tails cast in this manner generally grow back over time, though the replacement is typically darker in colour than the original. The tails of grazing animals, such as horses, are used both to sweep away insects and positioned or moved in ways that indicate the animal's physical or emotional state. Human embryos have a tail that measures about one-sixth of the size of the embryo itself. Infrequently, a child is born with a ’""soft tail"", which contains no vertebrae, but only blood vessels, muscles, and nerves, but this is regarded as an abnormality rather than a vestigial true tail.

Back To the pageYou came from: The sex museum in Amsterdam, which city is it? Back to the pages you were from. The sex Museum in Amsterdam is a museum of erotic art and culture. It was opened in 1985 and attracts 500,000 visitors a year. The museum's contents were not particularly numerous. All that could be taken for granted in the enterprise was public interest in the erotic, whether for historical or artistic or other reasons. The Museum's director Monique van M. may well have been the youngest museum director in Europe - young enough still to depend on the support and advice of her father. At the opening of the Museum, Monique was still the youngest director. Today, the museum is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world. It is open to visitors from all over the world, from all walks of life. Simply asking a curator where erotic art may be found in an art museum meets with a negative response. And in any case, erotic works often tend to hit the moral blind spot in any given case, and tend to tend to be of a less-than-stellar quality. And so it is with the Sex Museum of Amsterdam. It has created the crucial part of the subject that is crucial to all the outstanding works on erotic art from all around the world - the subject of the museum's exhibitions. It also has the most erotic works on display in any museum, from the works of Pablo Picasso to the work of Frida Ghitis. Ashfield has been almost always a Labour Party seat since it was created in 1955. It has been served by a former Secretary of State, Geoff Hoon, since 1992. It is now represented by Gloria De Piero, who came close to losing the seat after a 17.2% swing to the Liberal Democrats in 2010 but increased her majority again in 2015. The phrase was first used in an offensive sense by the French revolutionary Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac on June 11, 1794 in a speech to the National Convention. Later, during the Napoleonic wars, the British press mentioned the phrase, attributing it either to ‘the French’ or to Napoleon himself. There is reason to doubt that Napoleon ever used it. The supposed French original as uttered by Napoleon (une nation de boutiquiers) is frequently cited, but it has no attestation. If O'Meara is to be believed, Napoleon said: “Let Pitt then boast of his victory to his nation of shopkeepers” The phrase has been erroneously attributed to a Nation, which has derived its principal prosperity from its commercial greatness. To our astonishment we now find it applied exclusively to BONAPARTE, which was scarcely known at the time of the battle of t-memorable battle of 1832. The same observation was made at the same time on that splenetic occasion which was made by the same officer of rank, but which was totally unconnected with politics. We find nothing that can be further from the fact that he was an inferior Officer of the rank of NAPOLEON, he merely being merely an Officer of inferior rank, and nothing that he did not mean to say. We are happy to make clear that this is not the case, and that he meant no harm by his use of the term ‘NAPOON’. The word ‘napoleonic’ means ‘nation’ in French, not ‘Nation of Shopkeepers’, and it is a reference to England or the United Kingdom, not to the French or the French themselves. The term “nation” is used to refer to a nation of people, not a nation, as in the case of Napoleon’s “nations’ of 1794 or 1795. The ‘ nation’ is not a term for a country, but a group of people who live in the same area of England or Wales, and has no connection with the French. The phrase did not originate with Napoleon, or even Barère. It first appears in a non-pejorative sense in The Wealth of Nations (1776) It is unlikely that either Adam Smith or Napoleon used the phrase to describe that class of small retailers who would not even have had the franchise. The phrase may have been part of standard 18th century economic dialogue. It has been suggested that Napoleon may have heard it during a meeting of the French Convention on 11 June 1794, when Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac quoted Smith's phrase. The Britannia Coco-nut Dancers or Nutters are a troupe of Lancastrian clog dancers who perform every Easter in Bacup, dancing 7 mi across the town. They wear white turbans with blue plumes, dark jerseys and trews, a white baldric, red and white skirts, white hose and black clogs. Some say the custom was brought to the area by Moors who settled in Cornwall in the 17th century, became miners and then moved to work in quarries in Lancashire. Similar dances – the Danse des Coco – are performed in Provence. The name refers to the wooden nuts worn at their knees, waists and wrists, which are made from the tops of bobbins. These are taped together like castanets as a percussive accompaniment to the dance, the nuts on the hands striking the nuts in the waist or knees in an intricate and dextrous rhythm. The troupe was formed as the Tunstead Mill Nutters in 1857 when it was one of a group of five which performed in the Rossendale valley. According to the Burnley Gazette, a man named Abraham Spencer (1842–1918) wasone of the founders back in 18 57, at only 15. They passed on their tradition to workers at the Britannia Mill in the 1920s. Their dances feature floral hoops or garlands; the musical accompaniment is provided by a concertina or the Stacksteads Silver Band. Their faces are blackened. This is popularly explained as either due to the origins of the dance in the community, a reference to the dancers' ancient origin as Barbary pirates, or a ward of the mining of Theresa Buck or a disguise to ward off evil spirits. The main annual performance is on Easter Saturday, but rehearsals take place weekly throughout the year. In 2013, the annual performance was threatened by public sector austerity as the police and local authority threatened to withdraw support for the traffic management and security at the event. The dancers have been exposed to information from these publications, whether first-hand or further removed.

SI RADIATION MEASUREMENT UNITS: CONVERSION FACTORS - Giants
SI RADIATION MEASUREMENT UNITS: CONVERSION FACTORS
SI RADIATION MEASUREMENT UNITS: CONVERSION FACTORS
What's the Difference Between Roentgen, Rad and Rem Radiation Measurements?
A: Since nuclear radiation affects people, we must be able to measure its presence. We also need to relate the amount of radiation received by the body to its physiological effects. Two terms used to relate the amount of radiation received by the body are exposure and dose. When you are exposed to radiation, your body absorbs a dose of radiation.
As in most measurement quantities, certain units are used to properly express the measurement. For radiation measurements they are:
* Roentgen: The roentgen measures the energy produced by gamma radiation in a cubic centimeter of air. It is usually abbreviated with the capital letter ""R"". A milliroentgen, or ""mR"", is equal to one one-thousandth of a roentgen. An exposure of 50 roentgens would be written ""50 R"".
* Rad: Or, Radiation Absorbed Dose recognizes that different materials that receive the same exposure may not absorb the same amount of energy. A rad measures the amount of radiation energy transferred to some mass of material, typically humans. One roentgen of gamma radiation exposure results in about one rad of absorbed dose.
* Rem: Or, Roentgen Equivalent Man is a unit that relates the dose of any radiation to the biological effect of that dose. To relate the absorbed dose of specific types of radiation to their biological effect, a ""quality factor"" must be multiplied by the dose in rad, which then shows the dose in rems. For gamma rays and beta particles, 1 rad of exposure results in 1 rem of dose.
Other measurement terms: Standard International (SI) units which may be used in place of the rem and the rad are the sievert (Sv) and the gray (Gy). These units are related as follows: 1Sv = 100 rem, 1Gy = 100 rad. Two other terms which refer to the rate of radioactive decay of a radioactive material are curie (Ci) and becquerel (Bq).
Bottom Line: Fortunately, cutting through the above confusion, for purposes of practical radiation protection in humans, most experts agree (including FEMA Emergency Management Institute) that Roentgen, Rad and Rem can all be considered equivalent. The exposure rates you'll usually see will be expressed simply in terms of roentgen (R) or milliroentgen (mR).

Commander Shepard
Commander Shepard is the player character in BioWare's Mass Effect game trilogy: Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3. A veteran soldier of the Systems Alliance Navy military and N7-graduate of the Interplanetary Combatives Training (ICT) program, and the first human Citadel Council Spectre, Shepard works to stop ""the Reapers"", a sentient synthetic-machine race dedicated to wiping out all organic life. Shepard's gender, class, first name and facial appearance are chosen and customised by the player. Mark Meer provides the voice for male Shepards, while Jennifer Hale voices females. Since the player can choose the gender of Shepard, much of the dialogue revolving around the character is gender neutral with only a few exceptions.

Alan Shepard was the source of the character's name. Shepard's armour developed over the series, and was originally intended to be red-and-white. Though both genders were given equal importance during development, marketing felt there was a need for a single identifiable hero for promotion of the game. Various merchandise has been made, including several figurines. Shepard has appeared in cameo appearances in other Electronic Arts games, though they will not be appearing in any future Mass Effect ones.

Concept and creation

BioWare wanted players to feel special and empowered from the start of the game. Unlike other role-playing game protagonists, they felt Shepard should not be an entirely blank character for the player to create, in order to create a more ""intense"" experience; with Mass Effect being more cinematic than other BioWare video games, they felt they needed an ""extra bit"" with a sense of a specific flavour that can be caused by a memorable character, such as Star Treks Captain Kirk or  24s Jack Bauer.

Developers wanted to at least give Shepard a last name so that other characters could address them. The developers wanted a name that was both ""all-American"" and common, which led them to start looking at the original seven astronauts. Alan Shepard was chosen due to fitting with the idea of ""their"" Shepard, being tough and respected, and fitting in with the character being the first human Spectre – Alan Shepard being the first American in space.

During the development of the first game, the female Shepard was given equal importance as the male counterpart; unique lines were written for her as well as a unique romance option. In fact, the early model for animation tests featured a female Shepard. for When describing her, Casey Hudson said ""[s]he's not a caricature of the idea of role-playing as a female, but instead she's very impressive as a strong female character that's sensitive yet extremely confident and assertive"".

Appearance and design

Shepard's default armor was originally red-and-white, but this was changed to charcoal grey, with a red-and-white stripe and the N7 logo, as Shepard looked too much like a medic. The red stripe in the N7 logo is said to symbolise the blood the character must sacrifice to save the galaxy. The armour became piece-based in Mass Effect 2 to stress the character's silhouette, as well as making them look ""stronger and able to take more punishment"". Despite this, the colours, as well as other elements of the armor and the commander's appearance, are customisable in Mass Effect 2.

For the character customisation at the start of the game, they focused on ""quality and realism"". In order to test out the customisation system, the team made various celebrity look-alikes to ensure it offered a wide enough variety. The default male face, as well as the male body, were based on Dutch model Mark Vanderloo. The default female face changed slightly between the first and second game, but underwent a big redesign for Mass Effect 3. Six different designs for the default female Shepard were hosted online, and fans were told to vote for whichever design they preferred via Facebook; many different designs were made before the vote, but were whittled down to six by BioWare staff.  The blonde Shepard with freckles won, though BioWare later decided that the hairstyle may have interfered with the vote, and so made another competition to decide that. The red-haired Shepard won.

Passage:
Luguvalium
Luguvalium was a Roman town in northern Britain in antiquity. It was located within present-day Carlisle, Cumbria, and may have been the capital of the 4th-century province of Valentia.

Name

The Romans called the settlement at what is today Carlisle .  This was originally thought to mean ""wall[ed town] of Lugus"" but has since been explained as a borrowed Brittonic placename reconstructed as *Luguwalion, meaning ""[city] of Luguwalos"", Luguwalos being a masculine Celtic given name meaning ""strength of Lugus"".  The name apparently continued in use among Brythonic speakers in the Hen Ogledd and Wales and it was during that time that the initial element caer (""fort"") was added.  The place is mentioned in Welsh sources such as Nennius, who calls it ,Ford, David Nash. ""[http://www.britannia.com/history/ebk/articles/nenniuscities.html The 28 Cities of Britain]"" at Britannia. 2000. and the Book of Taliesin where it is rendered   (Modern Welsh '). (These derived from the original Brittonic name, rather than from its Latin form.) The earliest record of the place in English is as Luel ();  later medieval forms include Cardeol, Karlioli, and Cærleoil.  These appear to suggest that the northern form of the name did not have the final -ydd. (Compare the River Derwent in Cumbria with Derwenydd in Wales, both from Brittonic *Derwentjū.)

History

Prehistoric

There are limited remains of a settlement during the British Iron Age. Before the Romans, the chief city of the Carvetii seems to have been Clifton Dykes.

Roman

Following their earlier conquest of Britain and Boudica's revolt, the Romans erected a timber fort at the site around  72. The settlement formed part of the northern leg of the Roman-era Watling Street. Following the fort's demolition around 103, a second timber fort was constructed. About 165, this was replaced by a stone fortress.  Timber structures further to the south-east were probably associated military buildings. These were also later replaced in stone. When the civilian settlement in this area was enclosed by a stone wall is unknown, but it is generally assumed to have followed the line of the later medieval wall. The town probably became the civitas capital of the Carvetii tribe some time in the 2nd century and Cair Ligualid was listed among the 28 cities of Britain in Nennius.  A single large stone building has been located which may have been for administrative use. Industry included copper working and tanning, while merchants are also in evidence. Inscriptions show there was a Mithraeum in the town and possibly a temple to Mars,  who was identified with the local deity Belatucadros.

Medieval

Romano-British occupation of Luguvalium seems to have continued unbroken after the Roman withdrawal from Britain around 410. Possible 5th century buildings have been identified during excavation and Ford identifies the settlement as the court of Urien Rheged's kingdom. Saint Cuthbert visited the town in the 7th century and described the high stone walls and an impressive fountain, presumably fed by a still functioning aqueduct. The place was under the control of a '.

HM Prison Birmingham
HM Prison Winson Green (known locally as Winson Green Prison) is a Category B/C men's prison, located in the Winson Green area of Birmingham, England. The prison was formerly operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. It is now managed by G4S  . 

History

Birmingham is a Victorian prison, built in 1849.

Numerous judicial executions by hanging took place at the prison until the abolition of capital punishment in the UK. A total of 35 executions took place at Birmingham prison during the 20th century.  The last person ever to be hanged at the prison was a 20-year-old Jamaican named Oswald Augustus Grey. He was executed on 20 November 1962 after being convicted of the shooting death of newsagent Thomas Bates during the course of a robbery in Lee Bank Road on 3 June 1962.    Christopher Simcox, a double-murderer, was scheduled for execution at Birmingham prison on Tuesday, 17 March 1964, but was reprieved.

In 1995, Birmingham was criticised by its own Board of Visitors for being soft on prisoners. This arose after allegations that one inmate had gone on two weeks' holiday to Minorca, while being released for weekend leave. 

In January 1999 an inspection report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons attacked conditions at Birmingham, describing the health centre in the jail as the ""untidiest and dirtiest"" inspectors had ever come across. The report also criticised the prison for its lack of a sex offender treatment programme, the lack of employment and education opportunities, and the inadequate bathing arrangements where some inmates were only being allowed a full wash three times a week.

In March 2001 the Chief Inspector declared that conditions had worsened in Birmingham Prison where around 11% of inmates had claimed to have been assaulted by prison officers. One particular incident involved a mentally-disturbed prisoner who had been denied a wash or change of clothes for weeks because staff thought he was faking his illness. 

In 2002 the prison was expanded as a result of a multimillion-pound investment programme by the Prison Service. 450 additional prisoner places were added together with new workshops, educational facilities, a new healthcare centre and gym as well as extensions and improvements to existing facilities. Two years later, a report from the Chief Inspector found that conditions at Birmingham had substantially improved, stating that the prison was a place where ""positive attitudes are firmly embedded"". 

In November 2007 the Independent Monitoring Board warned in a report that overcrowding at Birmingham was putting prisoners and staff at risk. The report stated that if overcrowding was not tackled, then there was a potential for unrest.  Two years later, the Board issued another report that criticised levels of overcrowding at Birmingham Prison. The report also noted that inmates from the jail were being transferred to prisons further north, to accommodate increased prisoner levels from the South-East of England. 

Birmingham became the first publicly built, owned and operated prison in the UK to be transferred to the private sector. G4S formally took over the day-to-day running of the prison in October 2011. 

Executions

The following people were executed in Birmingham Prison between 1885 and 1962:

The prison today

Birmingham holds adult male prisoners, serving the Crown and Magistrates' Courts of Birmingham, Stafford and Wolverhampton and the Magistrates' Courts of Burton upon Trent, Cannock.
 
Education and training at Birmingham Prison is provided by Milton Keynes College. Learning programmes for inmates include basic and key skills, bricklaying, plumbing, painting and decorating, carpentry, joinery, forklift truck training, industrial cleaning, catering, textiles, barbering, information technology, business, creative arts and performing arts. All courses lead to qualifications such as NVQs, and there is the option for further study with the Open University.

The Prison Library Service is provided by Birmingham City Council's Library Services, and all prisoners have access to the service. As well as facilities for independent learners, the library has special collections on law, employment, health, community information, English as a second or other language (ESOL), and basic skills materials. There is also a Learning Centre within the library to provide additional learning support to those with dyslexia and ESOL needs.

Physical Education at Birmingham is provided on a daily basis over a 7-day period, and evenings over 5 days. There are a number of sports delivered and also sports related subjects from basic skills to NVQ Level 2 in Sports and Recreation.

Birmingham has a prison chaplaincy with full-time chaplains from the Church of England, Roman Catholic, Free Church and Muslim faiths. There are also sessional staff from the Sikh, Buddhist and Hindu faiths.

The Muses - Greek Mythology
The Muses
The Muses
See More The Muses Pictures >
The Muses were the Greek goddesses of inspiration in literature, science and the arts. They were the daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne (the personification of memory), and they were also considered water nymphs. Some scholars believed that the Muses were primordial goddesses, daughters of the Titans Uranus and Gaea . Personifications of knowledge and art, some of the arts of the Muses included Music, Science, Geography, Mathematics, Art, and Drama. They were usually invoked at the beginning of various lyrical poems, such as in the Homeric epics; this happened so that the Muses give inspiration or speak through the poet's words.
There were nine Muses according to Hesiod, protecting a different art and being symbolised with a different item; Calliope (epic poetry - writing tablet), Clio (history - scroll), Euterpe (lyric poetry - aulos, a Greek flute), Thalia (comedy and pastoral poetry - comic mask), Melpomene (tragedy - tragic mask), Terpsichore (dance - lyre), Erato (love poetry - cithara, a Greek type of lyre), Polyhymnia (sacred poetry - veil), and Urania (astronomy - globe and compass). On the other hand, Varro mentions that only three Muses exist: Melete (practice), Mneme (memory) and Aoide (song).
According to a myth, King Pierus of Macedon named his nine daughters after the Muses, thinking that they were better skilled than the goddesses themselves. As a result, his daughters, the Pierides, were transformed into magpies.

Endymion (poem)
Endymion is a poem by John Keats first published in 1818. It begins with the line ""A thing of beauty is a joy for ever"". Endymion is written in rhyming couplets in iambic pentameter (also known as heroic couplets). Keats based the poem on the Greek myth of Endymion, the shepherd beloved by the moon goddess Selene. The poem elaborates on the original story and renames Selene ""Cynthia"" (an alternative name for Artemis).

Narrative

It starts by painting a rustic scene of trees, rivers, shepherds, and sheep. The shepherds gather around an altar and pray to Pan, god of shepherds and flocks. As the youths sing and dance, the elder men sit and talk about what life would be like in the shades of Elysium. However, Endymion, the ""brain-sick shepherd-prince"" of Mt. Latmos, is in a trancelike state, and not participating in their discourse. His sister, Peona, takes him away and brings him to her resting place where he sleeps. After he wakes, he tells Peona of his encounter with Cynthia, and how much he loved her.

The poem is divided into four books, each approximately 1000 lines long. Book I gives Endymion's account of his dreams and experiences, as related to Peona, and give the background for the rest of the poem. In Book II, Endymion ventures into the underworld in search of his love. He encounters Adonis and Venus—a pairing of mortal and immortal—apparently foreshadowing a similar destiny for the mortal Endymion and his immortal paramour. Book III reveals Endymion's enduring love, and he begs the Moon not to torment him any longer as he journeys through a watery void on the sea floor. There he meets Glaucus, freeing the god from a thousand years of imprisonment by the witch Circe. Book IV, ""And so he groan'd, as one by beauty slain."" Endymion falls in love with a beautiful Indian maiden. Both ride winged black steeds to Mount Olympus where Cynthia awaits, only for Endymion to forsake the goddess for his new, mortal, love. Endymion and the Indian girl return to earth, the latter saying she cannot be his love. He is miserable, till quite suddenly he comes upon the Indian maiden again and she reveals that she is in fact Cynthia. She then tells him of how she tried to forget him, to move on, but that in the end, ""'There is not one,/ No, no, not one/ But thee.'""

Critical reception

Endymion received scathing criticism after its release,  and Keats himself noted its diffuse and unappealing style. Keats did not regret writing it, as he likened the process to leaping into the ocean to become more acquainted with his surroundings; in a poem to J. A. Hessey, he expressed that ""I was never afraid of failure; for I would sooner fail than not be among the greatest."" However, he did express regret in its publishing, saying ""it is not without a feeling of regret that I make [Endymion] public.""

Not all critics disliked the work.  The poet Thomas Hood wrote 'Written in Keats' Endymion, in which the ""Muse...charming the air to music...gave back Endymion in a dreamlike tale"".  Henry Morley said, ""The song of Endymion throbs throughout with a noble poet's sense of all that his art means for him.  What mechanical defects there are in it may even serve to quicken our sense of the youth and freshness of this voice of aspiration.""

Patricia Routledge starred as the title character, Henrietta ""Hetty"" Wainthropp,  Derek Benfield as her patient husband Robert, Dominic Monaghan as her assistant and lodger Geoffrey Shawcross, and John Graham Davies as DCI Adams.
Later episodes include Suzanne Maddock as Janet Frazer, a feisty young auto mechanic and Frank Mills as Robert's brother Frank.

In the United States, episodes have been featured on PBS's anthology programme Mystery!.

Production

Hetty Wainthropp Investigates is based on characters from the novel Missing Persons (1986) by David Cook, who co-wrote the episodes with John Griffith Bowen. The incidents in Cook's novel were inspired by his own mother's experiences. Prior to the pilot going into production, Patricia Routledge read the story Missing Persons for BBC Radio 4's A Book At Bedtime in February 1987. 

In 1990 ITV broadcast a feature-length pilot, Missing Persons, featuring Tony Melody as Robert Wainthropp and Garry Halliday as Geoffrey Shawcross, but ITV opted not to pursue a series. The storyline of this episode is ignored in the subsequent BBC series, with the first episode establishing Hetty as a detective in her first case and meeting Geoffrey for the first time. The characterization of Hetty was altered considerably for the series from the pilot. The 'original' Hetty was blonde and far more 'theatrical' in her manner. Additionally, the pilot character lived in considerably better circumstances than the home seen in the series.

The BBC series was filmed primarily in Burnley, Darwen, Blackburn, Rossendale, Bolton and other locations in Lancashire.

The music for the series was composed by Nigel Hess, cornet solo performed by Phillip McCann and in 1997 the title track was awarded the Ivor Novello Award for best television theme.

The BBC series was popular with viewers, but no further episodes were commissioned after 1998. In 2008 Patricia Routledge said in an interview that the cast and crew had been told by the BBC at the end of the fourth series that a fifth series would be commissioned, but it never was. 

Synopsis
 
Hetty Wainthropp is a retired working-class woman from Darwen in North West England, who has a knack for jumping to conclusions and solving crimes of varying bafflement which often are too minor to concern the police. Although on occasion her husband offers assistance, he more often than not tends to the home while Hetty gads about the countryside with young Geoffrey in search of resolution and justice. In many episodes Hetty seeks the help and advice of DCI Adams of the local constabulary.

Wobbegong
Wobbegong is the common name given to the 12 species of carpet sharks in the family Orectolobidae.  They are found in shallow temperate and tropical waters of the western Pacific Ocean and eastern Indian Ocean, chiefly around Australia and Indonesia, although one species (the Japanese wobbegong, Orectolobus japonicus) occurs as far north as Japan. The word wobbegong is believed to come from an Australian Aboriginal language, meaning ""shaggy beard"", referring to the growths around the mouth of the shark of the western Pacific.

Description

Wobbegongs are bottom-dwelling sharks, so spend much of their time resting on the sea floor.  Most species have a maximum length of  or less, but the largest, the spotted wobbegong, Orectolobus maculatus, and banded wobbegong, O. halei, reach about 3 m in length.

Wobbegongs are well camouflaged with a symmetrical pattern of bold markings which resembles a carpet.  Because of this striking pattern, wobbegongs and their close relatives are often referred to as carpet sharks.  The camouflage is improved by the presence of small weed-like whisker lobes  surrounding the wobbegong's jaw, which help to camouflage it and act as sensory barbs. Wobbegongs make use of their relative invisibility to hide among rocks and catch smaller fish which swim too close, typical of ambush predators.

Interaction with humans

Wobbegongs are generally not dangerous to humans.  However, they have bitten people who accidentally step on them in shallow water or scuba  divers who poke or touch them. Unprovoked, they may also bite divers, surfers,  or snorkellers who swim near their hiding spots.   Wobbegongs are very flexible and can easily bite a hand holding onto their tail. 

They have many small but sharp teeth and their bite can be severe, even through a wetsuit; having once bitten, they have been known to hang on and can be very difficult to remove. 

In Australia, the flesh of wobbegongs and other shark species is called flake and it is often the ""fish"" component of fish and chips. Wobbegong skin is also used to make leather. 

Captivity

Although most wobbegong species are unsuitable for home aquaria due to their large adult size, this has not stopped some of the larger species from being sold in the aquarium trade.  Small wobbegong species, such as the tasselled wobbegong and Ward's wobbegong, are ""ideal"" sharks for home aquarists to keep because they are an appropriate size and are lethargic, enabling them to be accommodated within the limited space of home aquaria, although they will consume tankmates, even quite large ones. Some aquarists, by contrast, see the lack of activity to be a drawback to keeping wobbegongs and prefer more active sharks. Wobbegongs are largely nocturnal and, due to their slow metabolism, do not have to be fed as often as other sharks. Most do well on two feedings weekly. Underfed wobbegongs can be recognised by visibly atrophied dorsal musculature.

Genera and species

The 12 living species of wobbegong, in three genera, are:
* Genus Eucrossorhinus Regan, 1908
** Eucrossorhinus dasypogon (Bleeker, 1867) (tasselled wobbegong)
* Genus Orectolobus Bonaparte, 1834
** Orectolobus floridus Last & Chidlow, 2008 (floral banded wobbegong)
** Orectolobus halei Whitley, 1940.  (Gulf wobbegong or banded wobbegong)
** Orectolobus hutchinsi Last, Chidlow & Compagno, 2006.  (western wobbegong)
** Orectolobus japonicus Regan, 1906 (Japanese wobbegong)
** Orectolobus leptolineatus Last, Pogonoski & W. T. White, 2010 (Indonesian wobbegong)
** Orectolobus maculatus (Bonnaterre, 1788) (spotted wobbegong)
** Orectolobus ornatus (De Vis, 1883) (ornate wobbegong)
** Orectolobus parvimaculatus Last & Chidlow, 2008 (dwarf spotted wobbegong)
** Orectolobus reticulatus Last, Pogonoski & W. T. White, 2008 (network wobbegong)
** Orectolobus wardi Whitley, 1939 (northern wobbegong)
* Genus Sutorectus Whitley, 1939
** Sutorectus tentaculatus (W. K. H. Peters, 1864) (cobbler wobbegong)

Fossil genera include:
* Eometlaouia Noubhani & Cappetta, 2002

",['Max Bygraves'],5264,triviaqa,en,,1e0b36696772bb993b9a111bf51fc057294f186e4a7dd336," ""Food, Glorious Food"", written by Lionel Bart, is the opening song from the 1960s West End and Broadway musical (and 1968 film) Oliver! It is sung when the workhouse boys are dreaming and fantasizing about food while going to collect their gruel from the staff of the workhouses. A variation of this song is sung in the 2006 film Ice Age: The Meltdown. A version called ""Chips, Glorius Chips"" was used in advertising McCain oven chips in the UK from 2006-2010. In the Video game ""Borderlands"" a Psycho sings "" food, glorious food"" in the trailer for the 2009 animated film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. During Carpool Karaoke, James Corden and Flea sing Food Glorious food while RHCP were appearing on show. In New Zealand, Countdown supermarkets used the song as the background music for their 2015-2016 advertisements. The song is also used in a SpongeBob SquarePants episode titled ""Toy Store of Doom"". A version was used to advertise Cox Gigablast in Australia (season 2) A variant is sung by Templeton the Rat in the 1973 film Charlotte's Web by TempleTON the Rat while at the carnival. The word ""Rad"" is used to refer to the amount of radiation received by the body. When you are exposed to radiation, your body absorbs a dose of radiation. For radiation measurements, certain units are used to properly express the measurement. For gamma radiation measurements they are: Roentgen, Rad and Rem. One roentgen of gamma radiation exposure results in about one rad of absorbed dose. One rad of gamma Radiation exposure results. in about 1 rem of radiation exposure. One rem of exposure of 1 rad of radiation results in 1 rem. of radiation radiation. Two other terms which rGy = 100 rGy are the sievert and the gray (Gy). These units are related as follows: 1Sv 1, 100, 100v, 1Gy, 1S, 100Sv, 100Gy, 100R, 100r, 100s, 100G, 100g, 100l, 100m, 100M, 100L, 100N, 100T, 100P, 100W, 100C, 100H, 100D, 100F, 100K, 100A, 100E, 100J, 100B, 100Q, 100I, 100. Commander Shepard is the player character in BioWare's Mass Effect game trilogy: Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3. Shepard's gender, class, first name and facial appearance are chosen and customised by the player. Mark Meer provides the voice for male Shepards, while Jennifer Hale voices females. Alan Shepard was the source of the character's name. Shepard has appeared in cameo appearances in other Electronic Arts games, though they will not be appearing in any future Mass Effect ones. Shepard's default armor was originally red-and-white, but this was changed to charcoal grey. The red stripe in the N7 logo is said to symbolise the blood the character must sacrifice to save the galaxy. Her armour developed over the series, and was originally intended to be red- and-white. The armour became piece-based in Mass Effect2 to stress the character’s silhouette, as well as making them look ""stronger and able to take more punishment"". Despite this, the colours of the armor and the commander's appearance, are customisable in Masseffect 2. For purposes of practical radiation protection in humans, most experts agree that Roentgen, Rad and Rem can all be considered equivalent. The exposure rates you'll usually see will be expressed simply in terms of roentgen (R) or milliroent gen (mR).

It was located within present-day Carlisle, Cumbria, and may have been the capital of the 4th-century province of Valentia. The default male face, as well as the male body, were based on Dutch model Mark Vanderloo. Six different designs for the default female Shepard were hosted online, and fans were told to vote for whichever design they preferred via Facebook. The blonde Shepard with freckles won, though BioWare later decided that the hairstyle may have interfered with the vote, and so made another competition to decide that. The red-haired Shepard won. For more information on the Mass Effect series, visit BioWare's website or the official website for the game, which is available on PC, Mac and Linux.

(These derived from the original Brittonic name, rather than from its Latin form.) The earliest record of the place in English is as Luel ();  later medieval forms include Cardeol, Karlioli, and Cærleoil. Before the Romans, the chief city of the Carvetii seems to have been Clifton Dykes. Inscriptions show there was a Mithraeum in town and possibly the temple to Mars, who was identified with the local deity Belatucado-Medievalo-British occupation. A single large stone building has been located which may be for administrative use. Industry included copper working and tanning, while merchants are also in evidence. The settlement formed part of the northern leg of the Roman-era Watling Street. The Romans erected a timber fort at the site around  72. Birmingham Prison is a Category B/C men's prison in the Winson Green area of Birmingham, England. The prison was formerly operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. It is now managed by G4S. A total of 35 executions took place at Birmingham prison during the 20th century. The last person ever to be hanged at the prison was a 20-year-old Jamaican named Oswald Augustus Grey. In 1999 an inspection report described the health centre in the jail as the ""untidiest and dirtiest"" inspectors had ever come across. In 2001 the Chief Inspector declared that conditions had worsened in Birmingham Prison where around 11% of inmates had claimed to have been assaulted by prison officers. In November 2007 the Independent Monitoring Board warned in a report that overcrowding at Birmingham was putting prisoners and staff at risk. In October 2011 the prison became the first publicly built, owned and operated prison to be transferred to the private sector. It holds adult male prisoners, serving the Crown and Magistrates' Courts of Birmingham and Stafford and Wolverhampton. It also holds prisoners from Burton upon Trent, Cannock and Staffordshire. Education and training at Birmingham Prison is provided by Milton Keynes College. Learning programmes for inmates include basic and key skills, bricklaying, plumbing, paintin. and other skills. The place was under the control of a '. Cuthbert visited the town in the 7th century and described the high stone walls and an impressive fountain, presumably fed by a still functioning aqueduct. The jail was built in 1849 and is one of the oldest prisons in the UK. It was opened by Queen Victoria in 1839. It has been open to the public since 1849, but is now run by a private company. It currently holds adult men in Category B and C prisons. The Prison Service is responsible for the running of Birmingham Prison and the rest of the UK's major prisons, such as HMP Leamington Spa and HMP Staffordshire, as well as the Isle of Wight. Physical Education at Birmingham is provided on a daily basis over a 7-day period, and evenings over 5 days. There are a number of sports related subjects from basic skills to NVQ Level 2 in Sports and Recreation. There is also a Learning Centre within the library to provide additional learning support to those with dyslexia and ESOL needs. The prison is mentioned in the book The Third World War: August 1985 in which it and the city of Birmingham are destroyed by a Soviet nuclear warhead. Winson Green is featured in episode 3 season 2 of Peaky Blinders. Michael Collins, Irish revolutionary spent a short term at this prison after the Easter rising in 1916. Lee Hughes, former West Bromwich Albion striker, spent the early part of his six-year jail term for dangerous driving at the prison in 2004. There were nine Muses according to Hesiod, protecting a different art and being symbolised with a different item. Some scholars believed that the Muses were primordial goddesses, daughters of the Titans Uranus and Gaea. They were usually invoked at the beginning of various lyrical poems, such as in the Homeric epics. They were the Greek goddesses of inspiration in literature, science and the arts. As a result, King Pieruson of Macedon named his nine daughters after theMuses, thinking that they were better skilled than the goddesses. As the result, his daughters were transformed into magies. The Muses are also called the Muse of history, who is the muse of history and history of history. In Greek mythology, the Muse is the personification of memory, and they were also considered water nymphs. The Muse is also called Clio (history - scroll), Euterpe (lyric poetry - aulos, a Greek flute), Thalia (comedy and pastoral poetry - comic mask), Melpomene (tragedy - tragic mask), Terpsichore (dance - lyre), Erato (love poetry - cithara) and Urania (astronomy - globe and compass). On the other hand, Varro mentions that only three Muses exist: Melete (practice), Mneme (memory) and Aoide (song). According to a myth, King pieruson. named his daughters as the Muse. Endymion is a poem by John Keats first published in 1818. It is written in rhyming couplets in iambic pentameter (also known as heroic couplets) Keats based the poem on the Greek myth of Endymion, the shepherd beloved by the moon goddess Selene. The poem is divided into four books, each approximately 1000 lines long. It received scathing criticism after its release, and Keats himself noted its diffuse and unappealing style. Keats did not regret writing it, as he likened the process to leaping into the ocean to become more acquainted with his surroundings. In a poem to J. A. Hessey, he expressed that ""I was never afraid of failure; for I would sooner fail than not be among the greatest."" However, he did express regret in its publishing, saying ""it is not without a feeling of regret that I make it [endymion] public"" Not all critics disliked the work. The poet Thomas Hood wrote 'Written in Keats' EndymION, in which the ""Muse...charming the air to music...gave back Endymions in a dreamlike tale"" The poem has been featured on PBS's anthology programme Mystery Mystery! in the United States, and on BBC One's British cosy crime television programme Hetty Wainthropp Investigates in the UK, which aired between 1996 and 1998. The title character is the title character of the BBC One series, ""Hetty"" Wain Thropp, starring Derek Benfield as her patient husband Robert, Dominic Monaghan as her assistant, and Janet Maddock as her lodger John Adams. In the U.S., episodes have been featured in the anthology anthology ""Mystery Mystery!"" in the US, starring Frank Mills as Frank Frazer, a feisty young auto mechanic and Janet Frazer as Frank Mills's brother. The series has also featured on the PBS PBS channel, ""PBS Mystery Mystery"" in the USA, where it has been shown on PBS stations such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco. It has been described as ""the most beautiful poem in the history of the English language"" and has been called ""one of the greatest poems of all time"" and ""the greatest poem of the 20th century"". It has also been referred to as the ""greatest poem of our time"" Hetty Wainthropp is a retired working-class woman from Darwen in North West England.

The name wobbeGong is often referred to as carpet sharks and is improved by the presence of small weed-like whisker lobes surrounding thimble-like lobes around the body of the sharks. In the UK, the term 'wobbly shark' is used to refer to a type of sea otter that lives in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Papua New Guinea. The term 'carpet shark' refers to a species of shark that lives on the bottom of the sea floor in shallow waters and is often called a 'wobble-gong' or a'spotted shark' The word'spots' is also used to describe a small number of sharks that live in the same area of the ocean.

They can be kept in home aquaria, although some species are not suitable due to large adult size. Some of the larger species are being sold in the aquarium trade. The shark's jaw is camouflaged to camouflage it and act as sensory barbs. It is also known as a ""shark's jaw"" or ""sharks' jaw"" The shark can be seen by looking at its mouth and hearing its noises."

The Three Dancers
The Three Dancers (French: Les Trois Danseuses) is a painting by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, painted in June 1925.  It is an oil on canvas and measures 84.8 in x 56 in (215.3 cm x 142.2 cm).

Description

The painting shows three dancers, the one on the right being barely visible.  A macabre dance takes place, with the dancer on the left having her head bent at a near-impossible angle.  The dancer on the right is usually interpreted as being Ramon Pichot, a friend of Picasso who died during the painting of Three Dancers.  (Some critics believe it could well be Picasso's wife Olga Khokhlova.)  The one on the left is claimed to be Pichot’s wife Germaine Gargallo with the one in the centre being Gargallo’s boyfriend Carlos Casagemas, also Picasso’s friend.  Casagemas shot himself after failing to shoot Gargallo, twenty-five years before Pichot’s death, and the loss of two of his best friends spurred Picasso to paint this chilling depiction of the love triangle.

Background

Picasso painted The Three Dancers in Paris after a trip to Monte Carlo with his wife, ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova. At this time, Picasso was attracted to André Breton's Surrealism movement. In 1926 the painting appeared in Breton's work Le surréalisme et la peinture (Surrealism and Painting). Others link Three Dancers to Picasso's failing marriage to Khokhlova.

Its caption at the Tate Gallery gives some insight into the background of the painting: 

It is owned by the Tate Gallery, London, having been purchased by it in 1965, and is currently on display as part of the Tate Modern's 'Poetry and Dream' exhibition.  The purchase was facilitated by Picasso's friendship with Roland Penrose who was a trustee of the Tate at that time.

Cotopaxi - Highest Active Volcano of the World
Cotopaxi - Highest Active Volcano of the World
Venezuela
Cotopaxi
There are certain things we do that mark us forever. When I was staying in Quito for a few  weeks to better my Spanish I met Jörg from Switzerland, he was in Ecuador to climb mountains.
A few weeks before I had seen a glimpse of Cotopaxi, the fifth highest active volcano of the world, a  sight that had been so impressive that it haunted me for weeks.
From then on I felt an inner urge to climb her. There was just one little detail... I had never climbed  a mountain and didn't know if my body was fit for the task.
Jörg shared a room with me and one day suggested that we should have a go and climb one of the  smaller mountains near Quito. If I could make it on this one then there was a chance that the mountain I  desired for was not an impossible dream. Completely exhausted I arrived back in Quito a few days later,  I'd made it and passed the first test.
The first rush of blood that lifted me off my feet was when Jörg wanted to climb Cotopaxi and asked  if I wanted to join him. I couldn't believe it, the dream was becoming reality. It is one of those moments  that reality fades away and you enter a dreamlike state. We headed out to rent climbing gear, got on the  bus and hopped off at our destination.
I set up my tent to spend the night. Cotopaxi watches over us in the background.
This is where my adventure started... the entrance of Ecuador's Cotopaxi National Park (Parque Nacional de Cotopaxi)  where Cotopaxi, one of the highest active volcanoes in the world, is never out of view. From here we would have to hike for 3 days to get to the highest  refuge cabin at the foot of the mountain. Every day was just wonderful, the scenery so beautiful, green plains, lakes,  wild horses and then... there she was... Cotopaxi, the fifth highest active volcano in the world, reaching 5,897 meters (19,347 feet),  a mountain with such a beauty that it leaves you speechless, the world of senses disappears, the dreamlike state is  reality.
We reached the refuge cabin (4,800m./15,748 ft.) early afternoon. Hiking to this altitude let our bodies  acclimatize easily. That same night it happened. There was full moon and everybody at the refuge  had already left. Jörg gave me some advice, go slowly and steadily but do not stop. We set  out at 2 a.m., the moon lighting the way in a cloudless sky. This altitude demands some efforts  of your body and when we hit the ever staying snow-line it was time to put on our gear.
We went slowly but steadily; passing everybody that had left hours before us. We even passed the  Ecuadorian army, they had be doing some interesting exercises with their new recruits during the  afternoon, and they were not happy. At one stage Jörg had no clue of the route to follow and  we decided to let the army pass and follow in their footsteps.
The refuge cabin at 4,800 m./15,748 ft. on the slopes of Cotopaxi
just below the ever staying snow-line
Our destination, the summit of Cotopaxi
The sun was arising slowly, casting her light on Cotopaxi and warming my body. The summit was  not far away now, my dream was becoming reality by each step I was forcing myself to take. Once  passed 5,500 meters (18,000 feet) my body was giving me some signs of protest, my steps were becoming slower and slower,  exhaustion was getting the overhand, not able to think clearly anymore, just this urge to conquer her  by forcing myself to move on...
I remember the last 100 meters (33 feet), Jörg was pulling at the rope that held us together, urging  me to keep on going, he knew that my body had reached its limits. I can only say that, when I finally stood  on top of the most beautiful mountain I had ever seen, a sense of complete unity with the world that surrounded  me embraced my body and soul.
PS: Finally I can thank Jörg van der Heyden for inviting me to climb Cotopaxi. Without him I would never have  lived this unforgettable experience. It is something that will be cherished forever.
The sun is rising while we climb to the summit of Cotopaxi
The crater of Cotopaxi, I still can't believe I took that picture,

Passage:
Gold medal
A gold medal is the highest medal awarded for highest achievement in a non-military field. Its name derives from the use of at least a fraction of gold in form of plating or alloying in its manufacture. The award concept arose in the military, initially by simple recognition of military rank, and later by decorations for admission to military orders dating back to medieval times.

Since the eighteenth century, gold medals have been awarded in the arts, for example, by the Royal Danish Academy, usually as a symbol of an award to give an outstanding student some financial freedom. Others offer only the prestige of the award. Many organizations now award gold medals either annually or extraordinarily, including UNESCO and various academic societies.

While some gold medals are solid gold, others are gold-plated or silver-gilt, like those of the Olympic Games, the Lorentz Medal, the United States Congressional Gold Medal (displayed to the right) and the Nobel Prize medal. Nobel Prize medals consist of 18 carat green gold plated with 24 carat gold. Before 1980 they were struck in 23 carat gold.

Military origins

Before the establishment of standard military awards, e.g., the Medal of Honor, it was common practice to have a medal specially created to provide national recognition for a significant military or naval victory or accomplishment. In the United States, Congress would enact a resolution asking the President to reward those responsible. The commanding officer would receive a gold medal and his officers silver medals.  Other countries similarly honored their military and naval victors in a similar fashion.

Competition medals

Medals have historically been given as prizes in various types of competitive activities, especially athletics.

Traditionally, medals are made of the following metals:

# Gold (or another yellow metal, e.g., brass)
# Silver (or another grey metal, e.g., steel)
# Bronze

Occasionally, Platinum medals can be awarded.

These metals designate the first three Ages of Man in Greek mythology: the Golden Age, when men lived among the gods, the Silver Age, where youth lasted a hundred years, and the Bronze Age, the era of heroes.

The custom of awarding the sequence of gold, silver, and bronze medals for the first three highest achievers dates from at least the 19th century, with the National Association of Amateur Athletes in the United States awarding such medals as early as 1884. 

This standard was adopted for Olympic competition at the 1904 Summer Olympics. At the 1896 event, silver was awarded to winners and bronze to runners-up, while at 1900 other prizes were given, not medals.

Olympic Games

At the modern Olympic Games, winners of a sporting discipline receive a gold medal in recognition of their achievement.

At the Ancient Olympic Games only one winner per event was crowned with kotinos, an olive wreath made of wild olive leaves from a sacred tree near the temple of Zeus at Olympia. Aristophanes in Plutus makes a remark why victorious athletes are crowned with wreath made of wild olive instead of gold.  
Herodotus describes a story that explains why there were only a few Greek men at the Battle of Thermopylae since ""all other men were participating in the Olympic Games"" and that the prize for the winner was ""an olive-wreath"". When Tigranes, an Armenian general learned this, he uttered to his leader: ""Good heavens! what kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight? Men who do not compete for possessions, but for honour"".  Hence medals were not awarded at the ancient Olympic Games.

At the 1896 Summer Olympics, winners received a silver medal and the second-place finisher received a bronze medal. In 1900, most winners received cups or trophies instead of medals. The next three Olympics (1904, 1908, 1912) awarded the winners solid gold medals, but the medals themselves were smaller. The use of gold rapidly declined with the onset of the First World War and also with the onset of the Second World War.  The last series of Olympic medals to be made of solid gold were awarded at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden.

Olympic Gold medals are required to be made from at least 92.5% silver, and must contain a minimum of 6 grams of gold. All Olympic medals must be at least 60mm in diameter and 3mm thick. Minting the medals is the responsibility of the Olympic host. From 1928 through 1968 the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli of Greek goddess Nike with Rome's Colloseum in the background and text naming the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of Nike saluting an Olympic champion.

From the 1972 Summer Olympics through 2000, Cassioli's design (or a slight modification) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli's design showed a Roman amphitheater for what originally were Greek games, a new obverse design was commissioned for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. For the 2008 Beijing Olympics medals had a diameter of 70mm and were 6mm thick, with the front displaying a winged figure of victory and the back showed a Beijing Olympics symbol surrounded by an inset jade circle.

Winter Olympics medals have been of more varied design. The silver and bronze medals have always borne the same designs.

Other gold medal awards

The award of a gold medal, often coupled with the award of silver and bronze medals to the next place finishers, has been adopted in other competitive fields, such as music and writing, as well as some competitive games. Typically bronze medals are awarded only to third place, but in some contests there is some variety, such as International barbershop music contests where bronze medals are awarded for third, fourth, and fifth place.

Passage:
Julia Barfield
Julia Barfield (born 1952) is a British architect and director of Marks Barfield Architects, established in 1989. Barfield created the London Eye together with husband partner David Marks. Barfield has interest in vernacular architecture, geometry and in the way nature ""designs and organizes itself so efficiently"". She was influenced by Buckminster Fuller and his beliefs on how architects have a social and environmental responsibility. 

Education 

Julia Barfield studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture from 1972 to 1978. During her year out, she went to South America and worked in the barriadas of Lima in Peru designing housing and a community centre.

Experience 

After graduation, Barfield worked for Foster and Partners for nine years. In 1990, together with husband David Marks, they founded Marks Barfield Architects. During the last 13 years, with Marks, she has designed projects in the leisure, housing, transport, education and cultural sectors. 

London Eye

The best thing about the Eye is the journey. It’s not like the Eiffel tower, where you get in a dark lift and come out on to a platform at the top. The trip round is as important as the view. -Julia Barfield, 2015

In 1993, the Sunday Times and the Architecture Foundation held an open competition to design a landmark for the millennium, which would in turn be the London Eye. 

Awards 

Barfield is the winner of ""Architectural Practice of the Year"" in 2001 and a ""Queen's Award for Enterprise"" in 2003.

It is an oil on canvas and measures 84.8 in x 56 in (215.3 cm x 142.2 cm) The painting shows three dancers, the one on the right being barely visible. A macabre dance takes place, with the dancer on the left having her head bent at a near-impossible angle. Some critics believe it could well be Picasso's wife Olga Khokhlova. Cotopaxi is one of the highest active volcanoes in the world, reaching 5,897 meters (19,347 feet), a mountain with a beauty that leaves you speechless. From here we would have to hike for 3 days to get to the refuge at the foot of the mountain. It's a great way to get a view of the world from the safety of your own home, a cabin at the back of a mountainside, or even just a small hut in the middle of the forest. The painting is currently on display as part of the Tate Modern's 'Poetry and Dream' exhibition, which runs until September 28th. It will be on display at the Tate Gallery, London, until September 29th. For more information on the exhibition, visit the Tate's website or visit their Facebook page or Twitter account.

BBC ON THIS DAY | 7 | 1985: Boris Becker wins Wimbledon at 17
BBC ON THIS DAY | 7 | 1985: Boris Becker wins Wimbledon at 17
1985: Boris Becker wins Wimbledon at 17
A West German teenager has become the youngest ever player to win the Wimbledon tennis tournament.
Boris Becker, a 17-year-old unseeded outsider before the tournament began, raised the coveted silver trophy above his head to rapturous applause on centre court.
Becker is also the first German ever to win the title, and the first unseeded player.
He had dominated the match from the start, taking just three hours and 18 minutes to overpower eighth-seeded Kevin Curren, a South-African-born American.
Flamboyant
The match was a dramatic clash in the brilliant sunshine, made more spectacular by Becker's flamboyant style.
His massive serve sent balls scorching across the net. He scored 21 aces to Curren's 19.
Becker also has a habit of flinging himself around the court, diving headlong for volleys and baseline shots.
For half a set he played with his shirt caked in dirt after one particularly spectacular fall.
The final result was 6-3, 6-7, 7-6, 6-4.
'Idol' for Germany
""This is going to change tennis in Germany,"" he said after the match. ""I am the first Wimbledon winner and now they have an idol.""
After his defeat, Kevin Curren said he thought the game would see an increase in the number of successful young players, and predicted they would have more intense, but shorter, careers.
There was some speculation that Curren had been unnerved by Becker's openly aggressive style.
The young player sent a hostile stare to his opponent before and after points, and in the final caught Curren's shoulder as they passed when changing ends.
But Becker defended his tactics, saying ""I'm going on court to win, to fight, to do what I can.""
Child prodigy
Becker has had a brief but brilliant career. He began playing tennis aged eight, and by 12 years old was concentrating almost wholly on the game.
He won the West German junior championship aged 15 and was runner-up in the US junior championship.
Last January he took the Young Masters tournament in Birmingham, and won his first Grand Prix tournament at Queen's just three weeks ago.
He has won 28 of his 39 matches this year, and is expected to lead West Germany in the Davis Cup against the United States next month.

Group Names for Birds: A Partial List - Baltimore Bird Club
Group Names for Birds
Group Names for Birds: A Partial List
By Terry Ross
A bevy of quail A bouquet of pheasants [when flushed] A brood of hens A building of rooks A cast of hawks [or falcons] A charm of finches A colony of penguins A company of parrots A congregation of plovers A cover of coots A covey of partridges [or grouse or ptarmigans] A deceit of lapwings A descent of woodpeckers A dissimulation of birds A dole of doves An exaltation of larks A fall of woodcocks A flight of swallows [or doves, goshawks, or cormorants] A gaggle of geese [wild or domesticated] A host of sparrows A kettle of hawks [riding a thermal] A murmuration of starlings A murder of crows A muster of storks A nye of pheasants [on the ground] An ostentation of peacocks A paddling of ducks [on the water] A parliament of owls A party of jays A peep of chickens A pitying of turtledoves A raft of ducks A rafter of turkeys A siege of herons A skein of geese [in flight] A sord of mallards A spring of teal A tidings of magpies A trip of dotterel An unkindness of ravens A watch of nightingales A wedge of swans [or geese, flying in a ""V""] A wisp of snipe
Any of these group names may properly be used by birders who wish to display their erudition, although it is probably linguistically inaccurate (and it certainly is bad manners) to upbraid someone who refers to ""a bunch of ravens"" by saying, ""Surely you mean `an unkindness of ravens,' my good fellow.""  Most of these terms date back at least 500 years.  Some of them have been in continuous use since then; others have gone out of fashion and been resurrected in the last century or two; still others only exist on lists.
Most of these terms are listed in James Lipton's An Exaltation of Larks. Lipton's list is substantially based on very old sources.  There were manuscript lists of group names in the 15th century, and these lists appeared in some of the first books printed in England.  Many of them make their first appearance in John Lydgate's Debate between the Horse, Goose, and Sheep (1440); and Lydgate's terms along with others appear in The Book of Hawking and Hunting (also known as The Book of St.  Albans)  by Dame Juliana Barnes (1486).  Whether Lydgate and Barnes coined any of these terms, or whether they were setting down the terms that were considered proper in their day is not known.  Many of the terms did catch on, and the lists they appeared on were frequently reprinted.
The best source I know for investigating the histories of English words is  the Oxford English Dictionary.  Unfortunately, on the question whether  these terms ever were or still are appropriate, the OED is not entirely  helpful.  To make sense of the matter, I have placed the group names into  groups--
GROUP A--The following group names are standard:  A bevy of quail  A bouquet of pheasants   A brood of hens  A cast of hawks  A charm of finches  A covey of partridges  A flight of swallows  A gaggle of geese  A nye of pheasants  A siege of herons  A skein of geese  A trip of dotterel  A wisp of snipe  GROUP B--These terms are not group names for a particular type of bird, but have been commonly used for many different types:   Colony  Company  Flock  Parliament  Party  GROUP C--These terms are archaic; they were once obsolete, but they have  been revived somewhat in the 19th or 20th centuries:  A building of rooks  A murmuration of starlings  A muster of peacocks  A peep of chickens  A sord of mallards  A spring of teal  A watch of nightingales  GROUP D--These terms are obsolete; they appeared on the old lists, but almost nobody has used them in centuries:   A congregation of plovers  A dissimulation of birds  A dole of doves  A fall of woodcock  A host of sparrows  A paddling of ducks  An unkindness of ravens  GROUP E--These terms are not in the OED at all as group names for birds:  A cover of coots  A kettle of hawks  A murder of crows  An ostentation of peacocks  A pitying of turtledoves  A rafter of turkeys  A tidings of magpies
My categories are imprecise, but they provide some guidance about usage.  Have no qualms about using any of the terms in group A; use the terms in group B for any group of birds that seems apt; use the terms in groups C and D only if you don't mind being thought pedantic or literary; avoid the terms in group E unless you know something the OED doesn't.
Alas, the OED itself is not totally reliable: the word ""kettle"" (as both a noun and a verb) has been used by hawk watchers for many years, and it has often appeared in print; the OED editors obviously are not birders.  It may well be that the other terms in group E appear on the 15th-century lists and were simply missed.

National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers
The National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) represents colliery deputies and under-officials in the coal industry. NACODS was established as a national organisation in 1910. Prior to that date, the union existed as a federation of autonomous areas which were collectively known as the General Federation of Firemen's, Examiners' and Deputies Association of Great Britain. The present title of NACODS was adopted in 1947 when the coal industry was nationalised.
The union currently has 402 members (down from 16,000 in 1984) and is based in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. Its General Secretary is Ian Parker.  It is affiliated to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU).

Strikes

NACODS was much less willing to take industrial action than the NUM, which sometimes led to tension amongst workers in the mines.  Militants in the NUM nicknamed NACODS the ""National Association of Can-carriers, Obedient Dopes and Suckers"".  There were some confrontations during the 1972 strike, but nothing compared to what came in the 1984-85 strike.  

In April 1984, a small majority of NACODS voted to strike in support of the NUM, but this fell short of the two-thirds majority that their constitution required for a national strike.  The National Coal Board had decided in the 1972 strike that a NACODS member was entitled to stay off work without any loss of pay if he faced violence or aggressive intimidation from NUM pickets.  When the number of NUM strikebreakers increased in August, Merrick Spanton, the NCB personnel director, stated that he expected NACODS members to cross the picket lines to supervise their work.  As this would have meant crossing aggressive (and sometimes violent) lines, it brought another ballot for a national strike from NACODS.  For the first time in their history, NACODS voted to strike in September 1984 by a vote of 81%.   However, a deal negotiated by North Yorkshire NCB Director Michael Eaton persuaded NACODS to call off the strike action in return to changes to the review procedures for threatened collieries.   Ian MacGregor later admitted that if NACODS had gone ahead with a strike, a compromise would probably have been forced on the Coal Board. Files later made public showed that the Government had an informant inside the TUC, passing information about negotiations.

WHKMLA : History of Lombardo-Venetia, 1815-1860
WHKMLA :  History of Lombardo-Venetia, 1815-1860
Kingdom of Italy
Lombardo-Venetia 1797-1815
The Vienna Congress (1814-1815) created the Kingdom of Lombardo-Venetia, consisting of the pre-revolutionary Duchies of Milan and Mantua and the Terra Ferma with the city of Venice herself. Lombardo-Venetia was united with the Empire of Austria in Dynastic Union. Milan and Venice became capitals. Austria was the dominant military power on the Italian peninsula, Milan the base of military operations such as the Expedition against Sicily in 1820, the Intervention in Savoy-Piemont in 1821, the Occupation of Bologna 1832-1839.
The Austrian hold of Lombardo-Venetia was the major obstacle to the realization of the dream of Italian Unification propagated in the Risorgimento . In 1848, the Austrian monarchy was temporarily paralized, and her control over Milan and Lombardo-Venetia questioned; in 1849, Austria not only restored her control over Lombardo-Venetia, but also restored the pope to the Papal State , as well various expelled dynasts to their thrones. Yet the liberal constitution of Savoy-Piemont-Sardinia remained in force, and Savoy-Piemont-Sardinia, in  alliance with France, in the War of Italian Unification 1859, defeated Austria, which ceded Lombardy, but not Venetia, to France, which in return for Savoy and Nice, ceded Milan to Piemont-Sardinia.
In contrast to the traditional kingdoms the Austrian Emperor ruled, the newly created Kingdom of Lombardo-Venetia had no  previous constitution to be respected (the one of the Kingdom of Italy disregarded), no representative body to be consulted (three estates), and the Austrians failed to establish a Lombardo-Venetian diet. Absolutism was resurrected.
Austrian rule brought political stability and peace; the Horses of San Marco were restored to Venice. Within a few years, the Austrian administration reduced taxes, was more humane in the procedure of drafting soldiers (in comparison to the Nepoleonic administration), reduced the budget deficit, increased spending on public projects such as road construction, the hospitals, schools etc. Austrian Law, book censorship and a secret police were introduced, Freemasonry banned, the Carbonari persecuted. However, Italian  patriotism and liberalism was not suppressed; Milan became the center of the activities of Giuseppe Mazzini's Giovine Italia (Young Italy).  Attempts of the Austrian administration to create a nobility and bureaucracy loyal to the dynasty failed to win the loyalty of the population.
In 1817, Lombardo-Venetia had a population of c. 4 million; by 1847 it had risen to 5 million. Milan was the second largest city of the Austrian dominions. The Kingdom had two universities, Padova and Pavia. Lombardo-Venetia had a separate currency, 100 centesimi = 20 scudi = 1 Lira, in coins (banknotes were very unpopular, as Austria had undergone state bankrupcy in 1811 and the banknotes lacked backing). Investments were made to increase the size of the network of northern Italy's navigable rivers; attempts were made to introduce steam shipping. Railway construction began in 1840. However, the Austrian administration rejected the concept of connecting Milan by rail with (Piemontese) Genova; political reservations prevailed over economic arguments. In 1830 all of Venice was declared a free port. The industries of Lombardo-Venetia, most notably textile, metal and leather industries, in Venice shipbuilding, flourished, promoted by the administration. In 1817 the import of machinery, of steam ships and of fuel for steam engines  was freed of import tariffs (Italy has hardly any coal deposits). A machinery industry emerged in the country; demands for a change in the curriculum of secondary schools, increasing hours in instruction in the natural sciences and technology at the expense of classic languages remained unanswered. Private schools were to educate a much needed skilled workforce. Despite press censorship, over half of the books published in Italy in 1835 were published in Lombardy-Venetia; Milan was a cultural center with an impact far beyond Lombardy-Venetia.
In 1838, Emperor Ferdinand I. of Austria (since 1835) was crowned in Milan.
In 1848, revolutions took place in most cities of northern Italy, Germany and Austria. Austrian General Radetzky maontained in control over Lombardo-Venetia, despite revolution in Milan and war declared on Austria by Savoy-Piemont-Sardinia. In 1849 the war was decided in favour of Austria.
Another decade of neoabsolutist Austrian administration followed. After 1848, drastic measures were undertaken against Italian patriots. A number of supporters of Giuseppe Mazzini were executed. An insurrection Mazzini had planned in Milan for 1853 failed. Austrian rule over Milan was terminated  in the war of 1859.

Passage:
Belted Galloway
The Belted Galloway is a heritage beef breed of cattle originating from Galloway in the west side of southern Scotland, adapted to living on the poor upland pastures and windswept moorlands of the region. The exact origin of the breed is unclear although it is often surmised that the white belt that distinguishes these cattle from the native black Galloway cattle may be as a result of cross breeding with Dutch Lakenvelder belted cattle. It is the belt that gives them their name.

Belted Galloways are primarily raised for their quality marbled beef, although they are sometimes milked and purchased to adorn pastures due to their striking appearance.

The black and red coat colours are caused by the same alleles of the MC1R gene, ED for black and e/e for red, as in most other breeds of cattle.

Breed history

The origin of the white belt is unknown, but generally presumed to come from cross breeding with Lakenvelder (""Dutch Belted"") cattle.  A Polled Herd Book was started in 1852 which registered both Aberdeen-Angus and Galloways. Galloway breeders acquired their own herd book in 1878. The DunDun is a light brown colour caused by the Dun gene and Belted Galloway Association was formed in Scotland in 1921, and in 1951 the name of the organisation was changed to the Belted Galloway Society and dun cattle were no longer registered. It also keeps and records pedigrees for Belted Galloways and oversees the registration of White and Red Galloways.  

Currently in the UK there is a thriving breeding programme overseen and guided by the Belted Galloway Cattle Society. Belted Galloways were first imported to the United States by a Mrs. McLean of East Kortright, New York. The formerly known American Belted Galloway Breeders Society was formed in the United States on 1 July 1951 by Harry A. Prock of Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania, Gordon Green of Quebec, Canada and Charles C. Wells of East Lansing, Michigan.  It is now known as The US Belted Galloway Society Inc. 

Population

Belted Galloways, also informally known as Belties, are currently listed with the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy as a ""recovering"" breed,  which means there are more than 2,500 annual registrations in the United States and a global population of exceeding than 10,000. However, this status still means that they were once on the watch list.  In 2007 they were formally removed from the UK Rare Breeds Survival Trust's watch list, having recovered sufficiently from the devastation of the foot and mouth crisis of the early 2000s, to have reached in excess of 1500 registered breeding females.  18,390 cattle were registered in the US in 2015. 

Characteristics

Galloway cattle are naturally polled. The most visible characteristics of the Belted Galloway are its long hair coat and the broad white belt that completely encircles the body. Its coarse outer coat helps shed the rain, and its soft undercoat provides insulation and waterproofing, enabling the breed to spend winter outside.  Black Belteds are most prominent, but Dun and Red Belteds are also recognised by breed societies, the latter being comparatively rare and sought after. A female Belted Galloway cannot be registered in the Herd Book if it has white above the dewclaw other than the belt, but can be registered in the Appendix. A bull can only be registered in the Herd book if it has no other white than the belt. 

The dun colour is caused by a mutation in the PMEL gene, the same mutation that causes dun and silver dun in Highland cattle. 

Bulls weigh from 1,700 pounds (770 kg) to 2,300 pounds (850 kg) with the usual being around 1,800 pounds (820 kg). Cows weigh from 1,000 pounds (450 kg) to 1,500 pounds (675 kg) with the usual being around 1,250 pounds (565 kg). Calves generally weigh around 70 pounds.  Belted Galloways are generally of a quiet temperament, but still maintain a maternal instinct and will protect a calf against perceived threats. 

They are well-suited for rough grazing land and will utilise coarse grasses other breeds would shun. They are able to maintain good condition on less than ideal pasture, and produce a high quality beef product on grass alone.

There were manuscript lists of group names in the 15th century. Many of them make their first appearance in John Lydgate's Debate between the Horse, Goose, and Sheep. Some of them have been in continuous use since then; others have gone out of fashion and been resurrected in the last century or two; still others only exist on lists. The best source I know for investigating the histories of English words is the Oxford English Dictionary. The OED is not entirely helpful on the question whether  these terms ever were or still are appropriate. To make sense of the matter, I have placed the group names into  groups--                 GROUP A--The following group names are standard:  A bevy of quail  A bouquet of pheasants  A brood of hens  A cast of hawks  A charm of finches  A covey of partridges  A flight of swallows  A gaggle of geese [wild or domesticated] A sord of mallards A spring of teal A tidings of magpies A trip of dotterel An unkindness of ravens A watch of nightingales A wedge of swans [or geese, flying in a ""V""] A wisp of snipe                 Group B--These terms are not group names for a particular type of bird, but have been commonly used for many different types:  Colony Company  Parliament Party Flock  Flock of rooks. Group C-- These terms are archaic; they were once obsolete but they have have been revived somewhat in the 19th or 20th centuries. Group D--These Terms are obsolete; they appeared on the old lists, but nobody has used them in centuries:   A congregation of plovers A cover of coots A coveY of partridge [or grouse or ptarmigans] A deceit of lapwings A descent of woodpeckers A dissimulation of birds A dole of doves An exaltation  of larks A fall of woodcocks A flight of swallows [or doves, goshawks, or cormorants] A host of sparrows A kettle of hawks [riding a thermal] A murmuration of starlings A murder of crows A muster of storks A nye of p heasants [on the ground] An ostentation of peacocks A paddling of ducks  on the water. Bird chatters suggest a list of whimsical group names. Use any of the terms in group A for any group of birds that seems apt. Avoid terms in groups C and D unless you know something the OED doesn't. The OED itself is not totally reliable: the word ""kettle"" has been used by hawk watchers for many years, and it has often appeared in print. It may well be that the other terms in Group E appear on the 15th-century lists and were simply missed. For more information on BirdChat, visit BirdChat.com. The group names have been submitted by Bruce Helmboldt, Stephan L. Moss, Pete Janzen, Macklin Smith, Billie Jo Johnstone, Richard Danca, Gail Mackiernan, Alice Rasa and Pete Novak.

The list has been compiled by BirdChat member Pete Novack, who is also the editor of the BirdChat website: birdchatter.com/birdchat. The names are based on suggestions from the group of bird chatters who sent in the names of their favorite birds. Tinsel is a glittering metallic substance, as copper or brass, in thin sheets, used in pieces, strips, threads, etc., to produce a sparkling effect cheaply. Tinsel is used attributively in phrases tinseled, tinseling or (especially British) tinselled. The word tinsel is also used to refer to anything glittering, showy, gaudy, or showy pretense. It is used to describe anything showy or attractive with little or no real worth; showy Pretense: ""The actress was tired of the fantasy and tinsel of her life"" Tinsel can also refer to a single word that refers to a period of time lasting 14 days: ""Lunar fortnight"" It can also mean any period of successive days including one and only one Sunday: ""Indian summer, Saint Martin's summer"" or ""It rained for a week"" and ""It is easier to make the repairs in the daytime"" The word Tinsel was first used in phrases satin, cloth, brocade or lamé; first used by the French in 1495-1505; by aphesis in 1505-1506. It means spark, flash, or flash of light, as in ""stincilla, stincilla scintilla"" (Old French estincelle) or ""flash of light"" (Vulgar Latin) It also means ""tinseled"", ""tinted,"" ""tinseling,"" ""tinsseling"" or 'tinselled' and 'tinting' or 'tsinseling' (British) and 'tinseled' (French) It is also a word for a piece of tinsel, such as brocade, which herews with spangles, spangles and spangles which he bestrewed with tinsel and brocade. It can be used as a verb to mean ""to adorn"" or to describe something glittering or glittering. It has also been used as an adjective to mean something glittery or glittery, like ""tinkering"" or a ""glittering"" effect. It was also used for the word ""tinnsel"" (French for tinsel), which means a shiny, glittering piece of fabric or cloth, or a shiny piece of silver or gold, or even tinsel itself. It may also be used to mean anything glittery and sparkly, including tinsel on a necklace or a bracelet. The National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) represents colliery deputies and under-officials in the coal industry. The union currently has 402 members (down from 16,000 in 1984) and is based in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. It is affiliated to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU) First recorded use of Tinseltown for ""Hollywood"" is from 1972. In April 1984, a small majority of NACODs voted to strike in support of the NUM, but this fell short of the two-thirds majority that their constitution required for a national strike. The National Coal Board had decided in the 1972 strike that a NacODS member was entitled to stay off work without any loss of pay if he faced violence or aggressive intimidation from NUM pickets. In September 1984, NACodS voted to go on strike for the first time in their history by a vote of 81%. However a North Yorkshire NCB Director negotiated a deal to call off the strike action in return for changes to the review procedures for collieries. The old pantheism was revived.ng but the old Pantheism revived. The pageants of Alexander, Csar, and Wellington were tinsel to this. J. H. Ward described the pageants as ""a kind of cloth made with interwoven gold or silver thread,"" from Middle French estincelle ""spark, spangle"" (see stencil ). Meaning ""very thin sheets or strips of shiny metal"" is recorded from 1590s. Figurative sense of ""anything showy with little real worth"" is in the 1650s, suggested from at least 15 90s. The word tinsel means ""a spark, from Latin scintilla; compare stencil""; it means ""anything cheap, showy, and gaudy"" or ""a piece of string with thin strips of metal foil attached along its length"" It is used to decorate with or as if with tinsel: snow tinsels the trees in the winter. It can also be used to give a 'gaudy appearance' to something that is cheap but cheaply attractive. It has been used to describe Christmas decorations in the past, such as in the 1950s and 1960s. It was also used to refer to Christmas lights in the 1970s and 1980s.

Augustus: Birth and Inheritance
Of Augustus’ many names and honorifics, historians favor three of them, each for a different phase in the emperor’s life. From his birth in 63 B.C. he was Octavius; after his adoption was announced in 44 B.C., Octavian; and beginning in 26 B.C. the Roman Senate conferred on him the name Augustus, the august or exalted one. He was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus in Velletri, 20 miles from Rome. His father was a senator and governor in the Roman Republic. His mother Atai was Caesar’s niece, and the young Octavius was raised in part by his grandmother Julia Ceasaris, Caesar’s sister.
Did You Know?
In 8 B.C. Augustus had the Roman month of Sextilius renamed after himself—as his great-uncle and predecessor Julius Caesar had done with July. August was the month of several of the emperor's greatest victories, including the defeat and suicide of Antony and Cleopatra. He did not increase the month's length, which had been 31 days since the establishment of the Julian calendar in 45 B.C.
Octavius donned the toga, the Roman sign of manhood, at age 16, and began taking on responsibilities through his family connections. In 47 B.C. he went to Hispania (modern-day Spain) to fight alongside Caesar. He was shipwrecked along the way, and had to cross enemy territory to reach his great-uncle—an act that impressed Caesar enough to name Octavius his heir and successor in his will.
Augustus: The Path to Power
The 17-year-old Octavius was at Apollonia (in present-day Albania) when the news of Caesar’s death and his own inheritance arrived. The dead ruler’s allies, including many in the senate, rallied around Octavian against their powerful rival Mark Antony . But after Octavian’s troops defeated Antony’s army in northern Italy, the future emperor refused an all-out pursuit of Antony, preferring an uneasy alliance with his rival.
In 43 B.C. Octavian, Antony and Marcus Aemilus Lepidus established the Second Triumvirate, a power-sharing agreement that divided up Rome’s territories among them, with Antony given the East, Lepidus Africa and Octavian the West. In 41 B.C. Antony began a romantic and political alliance with Cleopatra , queen of Egypt, which continued even after a Senatorial decree forced his marriage to Octavian’s sister Octavia Minor. Lepidus remained a minor figure until Octavian finally had him ousted after the triumvirate’s renewal in 37 B.C.
Antony’s affair with Cleopatra continued, and in 32 B.C. he divorced Octavia. In retaliation, Octavian declared war on Cleopatra. In the naval battle of Actium a year later, Octavian’s fleet, under his admiral Agrippa, cornered and defeated Antony’s ships. Cleopatra’s navy raced to aid her ally, but in the end the two lovers barely escaped. They returned to Egypt and committed suicide, leaving Octavian as Rome’s undisputed ruler.
Augustus: Emperor in All but Name
Historians date the start of Octavian’s monarchy to either 31 B.C. (the victory at Actium) or 27 B.C., when he was granted the name Augustus. In that four-year span, Octavian secured his rule on multiple fronts. Cleopatra’s seized treasure allowed him to pay his soldiers, securing their loyalty. To mollify Rome’s Senate and ruling classes, he passed laws harkening back—at least on the surface—to the traditions of the Roman Republic. And to win over the people, he worked to improve and beautify the city of Rome.
During his 40-years reign, Augustus nearly doubled the size of the empire, adding territories in Europe and Asia Minor and securing alliances that gave him effective rule from Britain to India. He spent much of his time outside of Rome, consolidating power in the provinces and instituting a system of censuses and taxation that integrated the empire’s furthest reaches. He expanded the Roman network of roads, founded the Praetorian Guard and the Roman postal service and remade Rome with both grand (a new forum) and practical gestures (police and fire departments).
Augustus: Family and Succession
Augustus married three times, although his first union, to Mark Antony’s stepdaughter Clodia Pulchra, was unconsummated. His second wife, Scribonia, bore his only child, Julia the Elder. He divorced in 39 B.C. to marry Livia Drusilla, who had two sons—Tiberius and Drusus—by her first husband, Mark Antony’s ally Tiberius Claudius Nero . The family tree became more complicated after Augustus had his stepson Tiberius briefly marry his daughter, and then adopted Tiberius outright as son and successor in A.D. 4.
Augustus Caesar died in A.D. 14, his empire secured and at peace. His reported last words were twofold: to his subjects he said, “I found Rome of clay; I leave it to you of marble,” but to the friends who had stayed with him in his rise to power he added, “Have I played the part well? Then applaud me as I exit.” Soon after that acknowledgement of human frailty, the Roman Senate officially declared their departed emperor, like Julius Caesar before him, to be a god.

M606 motorway
The M606 Bradford Spur motorway in England leaves the M62 motorway at junction 26, near Cleckheaton, and heads into Bradford, to join the A6177 Bradford Ring Road. It is officially named the ""Bradford South Radial Motorway"" and was opened in 1973.

Configuration of the terminal junctions

Staygate

The northern end of the M606, closest to the city, was built with a large raised roundabout crossing the Bradford Ring Road, but the original plans to continue the motorway under the roundabout  were not carried out: access was only by slip roads to and from the roundabout.

In 1999 a new slip road was built that allowed eastward traffic on the ring road, via a mini-roundabout, to enter the motorway directly and avoid the Staygate roundabout. 

In 2004 the junction was further remodelled, so that traffic leaving the motorway and wishing to turn eastward on the ring road continues under the roundabout, and round to join the roundabout from the opposite site, so that it has a left rather than a right turn to make (via two sets of traffic lights). 

Staygate roundabout is very close to Odsal Stadium, the home of the rugby league club Bradford Bulls.

 

Chain Bar

The southerly junction with the M62 is known as the Chain Bar Interchange and features free-flowing sliproads from the Manchester direction M62 traffic to Bradford, but not the Leeds direction, which has to use the traffic-light controlled roundabout.
Since late 2007 there is a 2+ lane leading from the M606 straight on to the M62 without having to stop at Chain Bar Interchange.

List of junctions

Britain's first dedicated motorway carpool lane

In 2007, work started on the M606 to create the UK's first motorway carpool lane (also known as high-occupancy vehicle or HOV lane). The  lane scheme is on the M606 southbound and will allow vehicles with more than one person in the car a fast track onto the M62 eastbound at Junction 26.

""The Edge of Heaven"" is a song by British pop duo Wham!, released on Epic Records in 1986. It was written by George Michael, one half of the duo, and was promoted in advance as Wham!'s farewell single.

History

With the known desire of George Michael to move into a more adult market, Wham! had announced in the spring of 1986 that Michael and his musical partner Andrew Ridgeley would go their separate ways after a farewell single, album and concert. The album was called ""The Final"" and the concert was held in front of 72,000 fans at London's Wembley Stadium on Saturday 28 June 1986. 

The single, a five-minute tale of emotional and physical frustration within a relationship, was a slick and upbeat — albeit harder-edged than earlier works — pop tune which became the fourth and final No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart  (and the final US Top Ten hit, reaching #10) for the duo. Elton John, a friend of Michael and Ridgeley, played piano on the track.

Michael has said the lyrics to the song were ""deliberately and overtly sexual, especially the first verse"".  The reason for this, he says, was he thought no one would care ""because no one listens to a Wham! lyric.  It had got to that stage."" 

Epic released a double record set in the UK, with an updated version of Wham!'s early signature song ""Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)"" on the flip of disc one, and two new songs - ""Battlestations"" and a cover of the Was (Not Was) song ""Where Did Your Heart Go?"" - on the flip of the second disc. ""Where Did Your Heart Go?"" was later given an equal billing and reached a lowly position in the UK Top 40 as a result.

In the United States, ""The Edge of Heaven"" was backed with a live version of ""Blue"" from Wham!'s tour of China. ""Where Did Your Heart Go?"" was released separately as the follow-up and the fourth and last single from Music from the Edge of Heaven (the shortened American version of The Final), and charted at #50 (backed with ""Wham! Rap '86"").

Two months earlier, George Michael had achieved his second solo No. 1 with ""A Different Corner"" (which also made #7 in the US), and he was back in the charts as a permanent solo artist within six months of ""The Edge of Heaven"".

Music video

The official music video for the song was directed by Andy Morahan.

Passage:
Patella
The patella, also known as the kneecap or kneepan, is a thick, circular-triangular bone which articulates with the femur (thigh bone) and covers and protects the anterior articular surface of the knee joint. The patella is found in many tetrapods, such as  mice, cats, and birds, but not in whales or most reptiles and amphibians such as snakes or frogs.

In humans, the patella is the largest sesamoid bone in the body. Babies are born with a patella of soft cartilage which begins to ossify into bone at about three years of age.
Structure 

The patella is a sesamoid bone roughly triangular in shape, with the apex of the patella facing downwards.The apex is the most inferior (lowest) part of the patella. It is pointed in shape, and gives attachment to the patellar ligament.

The front and back surfaces are joined by a thin margin and towards centre by a thicker margin. The tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle attaches to the base of the patella., with the vastus intermedius muscle attaching to the base itself, and the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis are attached to outer lateral and medial borders of patella respectively.

The upper third of the front of the patella is coarse, flattened, and rough, and serves for the attachment of the tendon of the quadriceps and often has exostoses. The middle third has numerous vascular canaliculi. The lower third culminates in the apex which serves as the origin of the patellar ligament. The posterior surface is divided into two parts.

Patella ant.jpg|Human left patella from the front
Patella post.jpg|Human left patella from behind

The upper three-quarters of the patella articulates with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and a lateral facet by a vertical ledge which varies in shape.

In the adult the articular surface is about 12 cm2 and covered by cartilage, which can reach a maximal thickness of 6 mm in the centre at about 30 years of age.

The lower part of the posterior surface has vascular canaliculi filled and is filled by fatty tissue, the infrapatellar fat pad.

Variation

Emarginations (i.e. patella emarginata, a ""missing piece"") are common laterally on the proximal edge. Bipartite patellas are the result of an ossification of a second cartilaginous layer at the location of an emargination.  Previously, bipartite patellas were explained as the failure of several ossification centres to fuse, but this idea has been rejected. Partite patellas occur almost exclusively in men.  Tripartite and even multipartite patellas occur.

The upper three-quarters of the patella articulates with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and a lateral facet by a vertical ledge which varies in shape.  Four main types of articular surface can be distinguished:
# Most commonly the medial articular surface is smaller than the lateral.
# Sometimes both articular surfaces are virtually equal in size.
# Occasionally, the medial surface is hypoplastic or
# the central ledge is only indicated.

Development

In the patella an ossification centre develops between the ages 3–6 years. The patella originates from two centres of ossification which unite when fully formed.

Function 

The primary functional role of the patella is knee extension. The patella increases the leverage that the tendon can exert on the femur by increasing the angle at which it acts.

It is attached to the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle, which contracts to extend/straighten the knee. The patella is stabilized by the insertion of the horizontal fibres of vastus medialis and by the prominence of the lateral femoral condyle, which discourages lateral dislocation during flexion. The retinacular fibres of the patella also stabilize it during exercise.

Clinical significance

Dislocation

Patellar dislocations occur with significant regularity, particular in young female athletes. It involves the patella sliding out of its position on the knee, most often laterally, and may be associated with extremely intense pain and swelling. The patella can be tracked back into the groove with an extension of the leg, and therefore sometimes returns into the proper position on its own.

Fracture

The kneecap is prone to injury because of its particularly exposed location, and fractures of the patella commonly occur as a consequence of direct trauma onto the knee. These fractures usually cause swelling and pain in the region, bleeding into the joint (hemarthrosis), and an inability to extend the knee. Patella fractures are usually treated with surgery, unless the damage is minimum and the extensor mechanism is intact.

Exostosis

An exostosis is the formation of new bone onto a bone, as a result of excess calcium formation. This can be the cause of chronic pain when formed on the patella.

Other animals

The patella has convergently evolved in placental mammals and birds; most marsupials have only rudimentary, non-ossified patellae although a few species possess a bony patella.  A patella is also present in the living monotremes, the platypus and the echidna. In more primitive tetrapods, including living amphibians and most reptiles (except some Lepidosaurs), the muscle tendons from the upper leg are attached directly to the tibia, and a patella is not present.

History

The etymology of patella presents a case of convergent etymology.  In the Western world, 'patella' originated in the late 17th century from the diminutive form of Latin ', meaning shallow dish.   The use of this term in Eastern medicine, however, predates the Western etymology.  As early as the 13th century, traditional Ayurveda practitioners in the Indian subcontinent referred to the kneecap as paṭēla haḍḍī (), literally 'farmer's bone' because the grueling life of a patidar.  The term was subsequently shortened to just 'patela'. During the British Raj period, Western medicine was introduced to India, and the two etymologies converged into the modern medical use, with two 'L's.

Harold Arlen - Biography - We're Off to See the Wizard
Harold Arlen - Biography - We're Off to See the Wizard
 
WE'RE OFF TO SEE THE WIZARD! - COMPOSING THE SCORE TO          THE WIZARD OF OZ
In          July 1938, Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg were signed by Metro Goldwyn Mayer (M-G-M) to write the score for the filming of the childhood classic The Wizard of Oz. Arthur Freed, associate producer of the film,          pushed for the Arlen-Harburg team to compose the score because he felt          that Harburg's feeling for lyrical fantasy and Arlen's musical fancy together          created the perfect combination for the project.
Once signed, the team began work immediately having only had two months          to turn out what was expected to be a unique and extended film score!          The pressure was on, even for the veteran writer Arlen, who later admitted          that the assignment really troubled him. Once they had completed what          Harold called the ""lemon drop"" songs, We're Off to See          the Wizard, The Merry Old Land of Oz, Ding-Dong!          The Witch is Dead, Harold felt that a ballad was needed to balance          them out. ""I felt we needed something with a sweep, a melody with          a broad, long, line. Time was getting short, I was getting anxious. My          feeling was that picture songs need to be lush, and picture songs are          hard to write.""
The song came to Harold literally out of the blue one day while he and          Anya were headed to a movie at Grauman's Chinese Theater. As they were          driving along Sunset Boulevard, the broad, long-lined melody suddenly          came to him. He jotted it down in the car on one of his jotting papers,          which he was known to carry around with him in case struck with an idea.          Of the breakthrough, Harold said, ""It was as if the Lord said, 'Well,          here it is, now stop worrying about it!'""
After completing the bridge (the middle section of the song) the next          day, the song was ready for Harburg to hear. Unfortunately, the lyricist          did not react to it with the joy Harold had hoped for. Harburg felt that the song was too grand in proportion for a little girl in Kansas to be          singing and that it might clash the direct simplicity and lightness of          the other songs. Still, Harold defended his hard-won tune and played it          for friend Ira Gershwin to get a second opinion. Gershwin liked it. Harburg,          in response to Gershwin's approval, quickly titled the new song Over          the Rainbow and composed its lyrics.
Judy Garland, who was cast to play the lead role of Dorothy, heard the          song and loved it, but the other ears at M-G-M were not as impressed.          Miss Garland has written, ""When I first met Harold I was just 14          years old and the first song of the score for The Wizard of Oz they played for me was Over the Rainbow. I was terribly          impressed by Mr. Arlen's great genius and very much in awe of him. As          I recall, it seems that Harold always treated me as an equal and not as          a child. We have been great friends through the years.""
""[As          for] my feeling toward Over the Rainbow now, it has become          a part of my life. It is so symbolic of everybody's dream and wish that          I am sure that's why people sometimes get tears in their eyes when they          hear it. I have sung it dozens of times and it's still the song that is          closest to my heart. It is very gratifying to have a song that is more or less known as my song, or my theme song, and to have had it written          by the fantastic Harold Arlen.""
Over the Rainbow was deleted from the print of The Wizard          of Oz three times! After each deletion Arthur Freed would storm into          the front office and argue it back into the film. Further opposition came          from the publisher, who objected to the ""difficult-to-sing"" octave leap in the melody on the word ""some-where,"" and also          to the simple middle. But Freed and Arlen stood up to the powers-that-be          and the song remained, ironically to later receive the Academy Award as          the best film song of the year!
The Wizard of Oz was completed in 1939 and cost M-G-M some three          million dollars to create. The movie was a huge success when released          that year. Over six decades later, it continues to be a favorite of the          young and old alike. The movie is simply magical as it takes its viewers          from reality to fantasy by transforming the black and white scenes in          Kansas to vivid color upon Dorothy's arrival in Oz. And while the special          effects, grand costumes, lavish scenery and masterful makeup capture the          eye, the songs settle in the hearts and heads of the audience and remain          long after the movie's end.
In          2000, Over the Rainbow was recognized as the Number One          Song of the 20th Century proving that the song that Harold Arlen worked          so hard to keep in the film was truly worth fighting for.
Question:
""Who wrote the songs for the film version of """"The Wizard of Oz""""?""

Passage:
Balance bicycle
A balance bicycle, or run bike is a training bicycle that helps children learn balance and steering.  It has no pedals and no drivetrain.

Designs

Balance bikes have been made out of both metal and wood. It can be a normal bicycle with pedals and related parts removed, or it can be purpose-built (especially for very small children, for whom normal bicycles are generally not available). It can have no brake, or it can have one or two hand-activated rim brakes.

To function properly, a balance bicycle must be small enough that the rider can walk the bicycle while sitting comfortably in the saddle, putting both feet flat on the ground.  The rider first walks the bicycle while standing over the saddle, then while sitting in the saddle.  Eventually, the rider feels comfortable enough to run and ""scoot"" while riding the bicycle, then to lift both feet off the ground and cruise while balancing on the two wheels.

Learning method

Manufacturers of balance bicycles say that children can learn to bicycle faster because they learn to balance and countersteer first and then to pedal later, and that training wheels slow learning because kids become too dependent on them, acquiring bad habits. Pediatricians  say that there is no evidence that children learn to bike faster without training wheels. Training wheels that prevent the bike from leaning also prevent countersteering, so that, as with a tricycle, kids learn to turn the handlebars the wrong way, which must be unlearned later. Sheldon Brown wrote that training wheels can become an obstacle to learning if they are adjusted incorrectly, because they prevent the bike from leaning if they are too low, and can inhibit braking if too much weight is taken off the rear wheel by training wheels that are too low. Adjusting training wheels correctly, and raising them higher as the child's skill increases, avoids these problems. Balance bikes with no brakes at all except the rider's feet might stop poorly as well, though very young children might not use brakes effectively anyway. Brown recommended simply removing the pedals from a normal kid's bicycle, avoiding the extra expense of a balance bike, and parents have had success with this approach.

History

The first balance bicycle was the dandy horse, and was invented by Karl Drais, the earliest form of a two-wheeler - without pedals. His first reported ride from Mannheim to Rheinau (now a section of Mannheim) took place on June 12, 1817.  Drais was a German inventor and invented the Laufmaschine (""running machine""), also later called the velocipede, draisine (English) or ""draisienne"" (French), or nicknamed, dandy horse. This incorporated the two-wheeler principle that is basic to the bicycle and motorcycle and meant the beginning of mechanized personal transport.

Passage:
Horology
Horology (via Latin horologium from Greek , from  hṓra ""hour; time"" and -o- interfix and suffix -logy; literally ""the study of time"")   is the art or science of measuring time. Clocks, watches, clockwork, sundials, hourglasses, clepsydras, timers, time recorders, marine chronometers and atomic clocks are all examples of instruments used to measure time.  In current usage, horology refers mainly to the study of mechanical time-keeping devices, while chronometry more broadly includes electronic devices that have largely supplanted mechanical clocks for the best accuracy and precision in time-keeping.

People interested in horology are called horologists. That term is used both by people who deal professionally with timekeeping apparatus (watchmakers, clockmakers), as well as aficionados and scholars of horology.  Horology and horologists have numerous organizations, both professional associations and more scholarly societies.

Museums and libraries 

There are many horology museums and several specialized libraries devoted to the subject. One example is the Royal Greenwich Observatory, which is also the source of the Prime Meridian (longitude 0° 0' 0""), and the home of the first marine timekeepers accurate enough to determine longitude (made by John Harrison). Other horological museums in the London area include the Clockmakers' Museum, which re-opened at the Science Museum in October 2015, and the horological collections at the British Museum, the Science Museum (London) and at the Wallace Collection.

One of the more comprehensive museums dedicated to horology is the Musée international d'horlogerie in La Chaux-de-Fonds (Switzerland). The Musée d'Horlogerie du Locle is smaller but located nearby. One of the better horological museums in Germany is the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum in Furtwangen im Schwarzwald, in the Black Forest. The two leading specialised horological museums in North America are the National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia, Pennsylvania, and the American Clock and Watch Museum in Bristol, Connecticut.

The eastern French city of Besançon has the Musée du Temps (Museum of Time) in the historic Palais Grenvelle.

An example of a museum devoted to one particular type of clock is the Cuckooland Museum in the U.K., which hosts the world's largest collection of antique cuckoo clocks.

One of the most comprehensive horological libraries open to the public is the National Watch and Clock Library in Columbia, Pennsylvania. Other good horological libraries providing public access are at the Musée international d'horlogerie in Switzerland, at the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum in Germany, and at the Guildhall Library in London.

Another museum dedicated to clocks is the Willard House and Clock Museum in Grafton, Massachusetts.

Organizations 

Notable scholarly horological organizations include:
* American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute – AWCI (United States of America)
* Antiquarian Horological Society – AHS (United Kingdom)
* British Horological Institute – BHI (United Kingdom)
* Chronometrophilia (Switzerland)
* Deutsche Gesellschaft für Chronometrie – DGC (Germany)
* National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors – NAWCC (United States of America)

Started: 1910
Size: $38 million in 1971; $1.238 billion in revenues for 2012
Elizabeth Arden was not just a leading beauty entrepreneur; she was a pioneering New Woman, suffragist and maverick. Born Florence Nightingale Graham in Canada, she trained and briefly worked as a nurse, where she was inspired by the use of creams to treat burns. She moved to New York in 1909, took a job at salon, and a year later opened her Fifth Avenue spa with what would become her trademark red door and her new name Elizabeth Arden. A staunch advocate for equality, Arden joined 15,000 women in a suffrage demonstration in 1912, with the marchers all donning red lipstick as a sign of fortitude. In 1914, she hired chemists to develop the first of hundreds of skincare products. Arden also mastered new, modern marketing techniques to promote cosmetics – which had previously been associated with prostitutes and other lower status women – to a respectable, upscale market. Her strategy worked. By 1922, Arden’s company became one of the first global brands when she opened a spa in Paris. Her longtime rivalry with Helena Rubenstein further sparked her ambition. Arden’s business not only survived the Great Depression, but in the 1930s was hailed as one of the three best-known American brands in the world (the other two were Coca-Cola and Singer Sewing Machines.) Arden shared the secrets of her success with would-be women entrepreneurs at seminars after World War II and in 1946 was the first woman on the cover of Time magazine. There were over 100 Elizabeth Arden Salons worldwide at the time of her death in 1966; the company was sold in 1971 for $38 million.
“It is remarkable what a woman can accomplish with just a little ambition.”

United States Secretary of State
The Secretary of State is a senior official of the federal government of the United States of America heading the U.S. Department of State, principally concerned with foreign policy and is considered to be the U.S. government's equivalent of a Minister for Foreign Affairs.  

The Secretary of State is appointed by the President of the United States and is confirmed by the United States Senate. The Secretary of State, along with the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, and Attorney General are generally regarded as the four most important cabinet members because of the importance of their respective departments.  Secretary of State is a Level I position in the Executive Schedule and thus earns the salary prescribed for that level.

The current Secretary of State is John Kerry, the 68th person to hold the office since its creation in 1789.

Duties and responsibilities

The specific duties of the Secretary of State include:

*Organizes and supervises the entire United States Department of State and the United States Foreign Service
*Advises the President on matters relating to U.S. foreign policy, including the appointment of diplomatic representatives to other nations, and on the acceptance or dismissal of representatives from other nations
*Participates in high-level negotiations with other countries, either bilaterally or as part of an international conference or organization, or appoints representatives to do so.  This includes the negotiation of international treaties and other agreements
*Responsible for overall direction, coordination, and supervision of interdepartmental activities of the U.S. Government overseas
*Providing information and services to U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad, including providing credentials in the form of passports and visas
*Ensures the protection of the U.S. Government to American citizens, property, and interests in foreign countries
*Supervises the United States immigration policy abroad
*Communicates issues relating the United States foreign policy to Congress and to U.S. citizens

The original duties of the Secretary of State include some domestic duties, such as: 
* Receipt, publication, distribution, and preservation of the laws of the United States
* Preparation, sealing, and recording of the commissions of Presidential appointees
* Preparation and authentication of copies of records and authentication of copies under the Department's seal
* Custody of the Great Seal of the United States
* Custody of the records of the former Secretary of the Continental Congress, except for those of the Treasury and War Departments

Most of the domestic functions of the Department of State have been transferred to other agencies. Those that remain include storage and use of the Great Seal of the United States, performance of protocol functions for the White House, and the drafting of certain proclamations.  The Secretary also negotiates with the individual States over the extradition of fugitives to foreign countries. Under Federal Law,  the resignation of a President or of a Vice-President is only valid if declared in writing, in an instrument delivered to the office of the Secretary of State. Accordingly, the resignations of President Nixon and of Vice-President Spiro Agnew, domestic issues, were formalized in instruments delivered to the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger.

As the highest-ranking member of the cabinet, the Secretary of State is the third-highest official of the executive branch of the Federal Government of the United States, after the President and Vice President and is fourth in line to succeed the Presidency, coming after the Vice President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the President pro tempore of the Senate.  Six Secretaries of State have gone on to be elected President.  Others, including Kerry, Hillary Clinton, William Seward, and Henry Clay have been unsuccessful presidential candidates, either before or after their term of office as Secretary of State.

As the head of the United States Foreign Service, the Secretary of State is responsible for management of the diplomatic service of the United States.  The foreign service employs about 12,000 people domestically and internationally, and supports 265 United States diplomatic missions around the world, including ambassadors to various nations.

The nature of the position means that Secretaries of State engage in travel around the world.  The record for most countries visited in a secretary's tenure is 112, by Hillary Rodham Clinton.   Second is Madeleine Albright with 96.  The record for most air miles traveled in a secretary's tenure is 1.06 million miles, by John Kerry.  Second is Rice's 1.059 million miles and third is Clinton's 956,733 miles.

When there is a vacancy in the office of Secretary of State, the duties are exercised either by another member of the cabinet, or, in more recent times, by a high-ranking official of the State Department until the President appoints, and the United States Senate confirms, a new Secretary.

Charles Macintosh and the Macintosh Raincoat
< Introduction: The Invention of Elastic
In 1823, Scottish chemist Charles Macintosh patented a method for making waterproof garments by using rubber dissolved in coal-tar naphtha for cementing two pieces of cloth together.
The now famous macintosh raincoat was named after Charles Macintosh. Macintosh raincoats were first made using the methods developed by Charles Macintosh.
Charles Macintosh Invents Waterproof Fabric
While he was trying to find uses for the waste products of gasworks, Macintosh discovered that coal-tar naphtha dissolved india rubber.         He took wool cloth and painted one side with the dissolved rubber preparation and placed another layer of wool cloth on top.
Improvements to Waterproof Fabrics
This created the first practical waterproof fabric, but the fabric was not perfect. It was easy to puncture when it was seamed, the natural oil in wool caused the rubber cement to deteriorate.

What is an ISA? - Moneysupermarket.com
What is an ISA?
What is an ISA?
Between now and the beginning of April is a crucial time for the nationâs savers.
What is an ISA?
Why? Because this is the window of opportunity left to cash in on our tax-free ISA allowances.
The tax advantages of these kinds of savings accounts make them hands-down the best way for most people to save.
But youâll need to know what an ISA is before you can understand the benefits.
So here is our five-minute guide to everything you need to know about ISAs.
What is an ISA?
Whatâs special about an ISA (which stands for an Individual Savings Account) is that it does not charge tax on the interest you earn. This is up to a certain annual limit which we will come to later.
In technical speak an ISA is a savings account which is held in a tax-free wrapper.
For higher-rate taxpayers, this means avoiding income tax at 40% on any savings interest, while for savers in the basic-rate tax band it provides a saving of 20%.
Those few paying additional rate tax will avoid tax on interest at 50% (though this will fall to 45% from the next tax year).
If you use the stocks and shares part of your ISA (which we will explain later) you will not have to pay Capital Gains Tax on your profits. When it comes to income tax, if you are a higher or an additional rate taxpayer, you will not have to pay those relative top slices of income tax on your dividends.
How much can I pay into an ISA?
For this tax year (up to April 5), the total ISA allowance per adult is Â£11,280.
You can only put up to Â£5,640 of this amount into a cash ISA, though.
The remaining Â£5,640 will have to be invested in an equity or stocks and shares, ISA.
From next tax year, the ISA allowance will increase to a total Â£11,520 of which Â£5,760 can be held in cash.
Junior ISAs, which replaced the Child Trust Fund in 2011, can hold up to Â£3,600 this tax year (going up to Â£3,720 next tax year) and the money can be split between cash and stocks and shares.
When and how can I invest?
Whether you want to use your full stocks and shares ISA allowance or just your cash allowance, you only have until April 5 to do either for the current 2012/2013 tax year.
You cannot roll it over to the next tax year, so it will be lost forever if you do not.
It is also worth noting that any money paid into your cash ISA and then withdrawn will still count towards your ISA allowance.
So if you paid the maximum Â£5,640 into your account and then withdraw Â£1,000, you will not be able to pay any more in before the end of the tax year due to this rule.
What different sorts of ISAs are available?
As long as you stay within the limits described above, you can open one cash ISA, and one stocks and shares ISA each tax year.
As indicated, only up to half of your allowance can be put into a cash ISA. Just like with standard savings accounts, you can choose to take an easy access ISA with a variable rate of interest, or lock in your money for a pre-set term at a (usually) more competitive fixed rate.
For qualifying children, parents can also invest in a Junior ISA that will be free of tax until the child reaches 18 and the money becomes theirs. Bear in mind these accounts are always held in the childâs name.
Do I have to split my money between cash and stocks and shares?
You do not have to split your ISA allowance between cash and other assets.
It is possible to invest the full Â£11,280 allowance in a stocks and shares ISA, within which you can choose the underlying investments â just like with a personal pension, for example.
Assets that can be held in a stocks and shares ISA include unit trusts, investment trusts, open ended investment companies, bonds, individual shares and exchange traded funds.
Remember, though, that while you can move money from a cash ISA into a stocks and shares ISA, you cannot transfer funds from an equity account to a cash one.
Can I switch to a better ISA if I already have one?
It is possible to transfer money invested in previous tax years between both cash and stocks and shares ISAs without losing the tax-free status.
However, you need to be careful not to physically withdraw the funds as this will result in you losing the tax breaks, just as you would if you withdrew a sum of money from the account.
Rather than closing your existing ISA and then looking to move the money into another account, you must therefore arrange a transfer with the provider to which you want to switch.
As not all accounts will accept transfers, this is something to bear in mind when comparing deals, as is the fact that some providers charge exit fees.
In the next few weeks, savings providers will be unveiling their menu of ISA deals as the new tax-year approaches. You can keep abreast of these and shop around for the best deals on MoneySupermarketâs ISA channel .

Passage:
Wolves Eat Dogs
Wolves Eat Dogs is a crime novel by Martin Cruz Smith, set in Russia and Ukraine in the year 2004. It is the fifth novel to feature Investigator Arkady Renko and the first one taking place during the new independent era.  

Plot

Russia has changed from a Communist to capitalist state, and Ukraine has seceded from the former Soviet Union. When Pavel ""Pasha"" Ivanov, one of the leading members of Russia's new billionaire class, dies in an apparent suicide, Renko investigates. Pasha fell from the balcony of his penthouse apartment, and all the signs point to his having been alone at the time. The only anomaly is a large mound of table salt in the victim's wardrobe.

Despite interference from his own boss as well as from other persons of power, Renko continues his investigation by questioning Pasha's friends and associates. There is apparently some kind of dark secret in Ivanov's past, and Pasha was always very depressed around May Day. Just before he is forcefully removed from the investigation, Arkady returns alone to Pasha's apartment and reconstructs his movements on the night he died. In the drawer of his bureau, Arkady finds a radiation dosimeter wrapped in a blood-stained handkerchief.  Turning it on, he finds that the entire apartment is radioactive, the highest levels coming from the mound of salt.  Arkady concludes that Ivanov did indeed commit suicide but that it was under a form of duress.

Explanation of the title

There are a number of possible interpretations of the title:
*Wolves are said to attack domesticated canines out of the sentiment that the dogs have betrayed their own species by living with and depending on humans for their survival. The contemptible dogs have unforgivingly traded their priceless freedom for food, security and other creature comforts.
*The murderer, when revealed, describes himself as a wolf, not so much for any violence or viciousness in his character, but because he considers himself a true predator: attacking his victims, and disposing of his unreliable associates, without compunction.  One of these associates, on his deathbed, mentions playing ""the Wolf"" in a school production of ""Peter and the Wolf,"" and fancied himself as a wolf, ""until I met a real one.""
*The title can also be taken as a metaphor describing the corruption surrounding Arkady; the ""wolves"" being large organizations or powerful men that eat the ""dogs"" (meaningless men like Arkady Renko), who are insignificant in society and prove to be nothing more but an obstacle that must be eradicated. As wolves hunt in packs to overpower their prey, so do businesses and large organizations in this novel.

Allusions to real-life history, persons, or places

*Most of the novel takes place in the ""dead zone"" around the site of the Chernobyl disaster.  To ""amuse"" a company at dinner one night, Alex tells his own dramatic story of exactly how the meltdown occurred.
*Oddly, the novel predates by several years the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, which bears certain similarities to the attacks on Pasha Ivanov.
*Though there are several radioactive isotopes found at the site of the Chernobyl disaster, Caesium-137 is the most common (which may be why the killer chooses it to attack Ivanov and Timofeyev).

Passage:
Rodney riots
The Rodney riots were  riots and civil disturbances in Kingston, Jamaica in October 1968.

The riots were inspired when the Jamaican government of Hugh Shearer banned Guyanese university lecturer Dr. Walter Rodney from returning to his teaching position at the University of the West Indies. Rodney, a historian of Africa had been active in the Black power movement, and had been sharply critical of the middle class in many Caribbean countries. Rodney was an avowed socialist who worked with the poor of Jamaica in an attempt to raise their political and cultural consciousness.

When Rodney attended a black writers' conference in Montreal, Canada in October 1968 the government took the opportunity to ban him from returning, citing among other things trips to Cuba and the USSR as justification.

On learning of the ban, students at UWI, Mona began a demonstration under the leadership of the Guild of Undergraduates, closing down the campus. They then proceeded to march first to the prime minister's residence, and then to the parliament building in Kingston. On the way many more demonstrators joined in, and eventually the disturbance became increasingly violent spreading across the city. Eventually, several people were killed and there were millions of dollars in property damages.

The riots were part of an emerging black consciousness movement in the Caribbean, and played a role in the mutiny of soldiers in Trinidad and Tobago two years later.

The ‘Rodney Riots’ took place on which Caribbean island in October 1968?

Jamica

Passage:
Give me liberty, or give me death!
""Give me liberty, or give me death!"" is a quotation attributed to Patrick Henry from a speech he made to the Virginia Convention on March 23, 1775, at St. John's Church in Richmond, Virginia.

He is credited with having swung the balance in convincing the convention to pass a resolution delivering Virginian troops for the Revolutionary War. Among the delegates to the convention were future U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.

Publication

The speech was not published until  the Port Folio printed a version of it in 1815..  The version of the speech that is known today first appeared in print in William Wirt's 1817 biography of Henry.  There is debate among historians as to whether, and to what extent, Henry or Wirt should be credited with authorship of the speech and its famous closing words. 

Reception

Whatever the exact words of Henry were, there can be no doubt of their impact. According to Edmund Randolph, the convention sat in silence for several minutes afterwards. Thomas Marshall told his son John Marshall, who later became Chief Justice of the United States, that the speech was “one of the most bold, vehement, and animated pieces of eloquence that had ever been delivered.”  Edward Carrington, who was listening outside a window of the church, asked to be buried on that spot. In 1810, he got his wish. And the drafter of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, George Mason, said, “Every word he says not only engages but commands the attention, and your passions are no longer your own when he addresses them.” More immediately, the resolution, declaring the United Colonies to be independent of the Kingdom of Great Britain, passed, and Henry was named chairman of the committee assigned to build a militia. Britain's royal governor, Lord Dunmore,  reacted by seizing the gunpowder in the public magazine at Williamsburg—Virginia’s equivalent of the battles of Lexington and Concord. Whatever the exact words of Henry were, “scholars, understandably, are troubled by the way Wirt brought into print Henry’s classic Liberty or Death speech,” wrote historian Bernard Mayo. “Yet . . . its expressions. . . seemed to have burned themselves into men’s memories. Certainly its spirit is that of the fiery orator who in 1775 so powerfully influenced Virginians and events leading to American independence.” 

Precursors

There have been similar phrases used before Henry's speech. The play, Cato, a Tragedy, was popular in the Colonies and well known by the Founding Fathers, who would quote from the play. George Washington had this play performed for the Continental Army at Valley Forge.  It contains the line, ""It is not now time to talk of aught/But chains or conquest, liberty or death"" (Act II, Scene 4).  The phrase ""Liberty or Death"" also appears on the Culpeper Minutemen flag of 1775. 

""Liberty or death"" in other contexts
 
The phrase appears in other nationalist contexts.  The national anthem of Uruguay, Orientales, la Patria o la Tumba, contains the line ¡Libertad o con gloria morir! (Liberty or with glory to die!)  The motto of Greece is ""Liberty or Death"" (Eleftheria i thanatos). A popular (and possibly concocted) story in Brazil relates that in 1822, the emperor Dom Pedro I uttered the famous Dom_Pedro_I#Independence_or_Death|Cry from [the river] Ipiranga, ""Independence or Death"" (Independência ou Morte), when Brazil was still a colony of Portugal. In March 1941 the motto of the public demonstrations in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia against signing the treaty with Nazi Germany was ""Better grave than slave"" (Bolje grob nego rob). More recently, in China, Ren Jianyu, a 25-year-old former college student ""village official"" was given a two-year re-education through labor sentence for an online anti-CPC speech. A T-shirt of Ren's saying ""Give me liberty or give me death!"" (in Chinese) has been taken as evidence of his anti-social guilt.

Passage:
Surrey Heath (UK Parliament constituency)
Surrey Heath is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2005 by Michael Gove, a Conservative.

Boundaries

Surrey Heath occupies the northwest corner of the county. It has electoral wards:
*Bagshot, Bisley, Chobham, Frimley, Frimley Green, Heatherside, Lightwater, Mytchett and Deepcut, Old Dean, Parkside, St Michaels, St Pauls, Town, Watchett, West End, and Windlesham in the Surrey Heath District
*Ash South and Tongham, Ash Vale, and Ash Wharf in the Borough of Guildford.

The largest town is Camberley. The Boundary Commission made no boundary changes for Surrey Heath in the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies before the 2010 general election.

The large village of Ash with Ash Vale and smaller one of Tongham are contiguous, similar to Frimley and Frimley Green.

History

The constituency was created in 1997 from the most part of the seat of North West Surrey (which was abolished) and smaller parts of Woking and Guildford, seats which remain.

On the seat's creation, Nick Hawkins was elected to Parliament following the retirement of Surrey North West MP Michael Grylls who in 1992 achieved a majority of 28,392.  One of Hawkins' opponents for selection was future Speaker, John Bercow. Bercow was selected as the Conservative candidate for the Buckingham constituency on the same day. 

In 2004 the Conservative constituency association, then the richest in the country, deselected their MP Nick Hawkins in the hope of obtaining an MP of Cabinet calibre. 

;Prominent members
Present Member since 2005, Michael Gove was formerly Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor. 

Constituency profile

In terms of housing 70% of homes are detached or semi-detached at the 2011 census.  The detached percentage (45.2%) was at that time the second highest in the South East, behind the New Forest.   The area is well connected to London Heathrow Airport, IT, telecommunications and logistics centres of the M3 and M4 'corridors' and to the military towns of Aldershot and Sandhurst.  Farnborough with its civil, private aviation base with certain military uses is also nearby, as is Blackbushe Airport.

Workless claimants, registered jobseekers,  were in November 2012 significantly lower than the national average of 3.8%, at 1.7% of the population based on a statistical compilation by The Guardian. 

The constituency is one of the Conservative party's safest seats, with most wards firmly in their camp, the exception being the Old Dean ward which usually votes Labour at local level. According to the British Election Study, it is the most right-wing seat in the UK.

It articulates with the femur (thigh bone) and protects the anterior articular surface of the knee joint. Babies are born with a patellA of soft cartilage which begins to ossify into bone at about three years of age. Patellas are the result of an ossification of a second cartilaginous layer at the location of an emargination. Partite patellas almost always occur on the proximal edge of a bipartas, but this has been rejected as the idea has been almost exclusive to Wham! There is no known cure for the condition, but it can be treated with cortisone injections and other drugs. The most common way to treat it is to have it replaced with a new bone, such as the bone from a different species of kneepan. For more information, visit the Patella website. The patell a is roughly triangular in shape, with the apex of the patello facing downwards. It is the most inferior (lowest) part of the body, and gives attachment to thepatellar ligament. The front and back surfaces are joined by a thin margin and towards centre by a thicker margin. The lower part has vascular canaliculi filled and is filled by fatty tissue, the pad of the fat pad (Emarginata pargata) and fatty tissue. It can reach a maximal thickness of 6 mm in the centre of the centre at about 30 years age. In the adult adult, the articularsurface is about 12 cm2 covered by cartilage, which can be covered by a thick layer of cartilage at age 30 years old. The upper third of the front is coarse, flattened, and rough, and serves for the attachment of the tendon of the quadriceps and often has exostoses. The middle third culminates in the apex which serves as the origin of thePatella ligament, which varies in shape and size. The posterior surface is divided into two parts and is subdivided into a medial and a lateral facet by a vertical ledge which varies. in shape. It has a maximum thickness of about 6 mm at about 20 years age, and can be filled with fatty tissue at age 20 years old or older. The anterior surface is filled with cartilage and fat tissue, and the lower third has numerous vascular Canaliculi. (Em Garginata e.g.) for the duo. Elton John, a friend of Michael and Ridgeley, played piano on the track. The patella originates from two centres of ossification which unite when fully formed. It is attached to the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle, which contracts to extend/straighten the knee. In the Western world, 'patella' originated in the late 17th century from the diminutive form of Latin ', meaning shallow dish. The use of this term in Eastern medicine, however, predates the Western etymology. In more primitive tetrapods, including living amphibians and most reptiles, the muscle tendons from the upper leg are attached directly to the tibia, and a patellA is not present. The kneecap is prone to injury because of its particularly exposed location. Patella fractures are usually treated with surgery, unless the damage is minimum and the extensor mechanism is intact. An exostosis is the formation of new bone onto a bone, as a result of excess calcium formation. This can be the cause of chronic pain when formed on the patellas. The patell a has convergently evolved in placental mammals and birds; most marsupials have only rudimentary, non-ossified patellae although a few species possess a bony patello. A patelli is also present in the living monotremes, the platypus and the echidna. The Wizard of Oz producer, Harold Arlen, pushed for the Arlen score for the WIZARD OF OZ. The score was written by Goldwyn Mayer-G-M-M, producer of the filming of the classic film, and associate associate of the film producer, Arthur Freed. The film was released in July 1938, and the score was later used in the film The Wizard Of Oz, which was released on July 25, 1939, and released in the UK on July 26, 1939. The movie was a box office success, grossing more than £1.5 million. The soundtrack was released by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, and was a huge success in the US. It was also released in Europe and the UK in the 1940s and 1950s, with the UK release in the 1950s and the US in the 1960s. The UK release of the movie in the 1970s and 1980s was also a big success, with sales of more than $1.2 million. It has been described as the 'greatest film of all time' by critics and fans. Harburg team to compose the score because he felt that Harburg's feeling for lyrical fantasy and Arlen's musical fancy together created the perfect combination for the project. The song came to Harold literally out of the blue one day while he and Anya were headed to a movie at Grauman's Chinese Theater. Harburg felt that the song was too grand in proportion for a little girl in Kansas to be singing and that it might clash the direct simplicity and lightness of the other songs. Judy Garland has written, ""When I first met Harold I was just 14 and the first song of the score for The Wizard of Oz they played for me was Over the Rainbow. I am sure that people sometimes get tears in their eyes when they hear it. It is very gratifying to have a song that is more or less known as my song, or my theme, and to have had it written by the fantastic Harold Arlen.""Over the Rainbow was deleted from the print of The Wizard  of Oz and is now known as the theme song to the popular children's movie The Lion, the Witch, and the Scarecrow. The film was released in 1939 and was a box-office success, grossing more than $1.2 billion worldwide and $4 billion in U.S. sales. It was also the first film to be directed by George Lucas, who went on to direct The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and The Desolation of the Planet of the Apes and The Godfather, among other films. The movie was released on December 18, 1939. The soundtrack was released to theaters on December 25, 1939, and was the first movie to be released in English and Spanish. It has been released on CD on December 26, 2009, and on DVD on December 27, 2009. The DVD is available for the first time on Blu-ray and DVD. The Blu-Ray version of the movie is available in a limited edition of 1,000 copies, with a limited run of 2,000. The CD will be released on the 30th anniversary of the release of the film, on December 30, 2010, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, with an additional 2,500 copies of the original CD available on the following day.

A balance bicycle, or run bike, is a training bicycle that helps children learn balance and steering. It has no pedals and no drivetrain. The first balance bicycle was the dandy horse, invented by Karl Drais, the earliest form of a two-wheeler - without pedals. A balance bicycle must be small enough that the rider can walk the bicycle while sitting comfortably in the saddle, putting both feet flat on the ground. It can be a normal bicycle with pedals and related parts removed, or it can be purpose-built (especially for very small children, for whom normal bicycles are generally not available) Balance bikes with no brakes at all except the rider's feet might stop poorly as well, though very young children might not use brakes effectively anyway. There is no evidence that children learn to bike faster without training wheels. Training wheels that prevent the bike from leaning also prevent countersteering, so that, as with a tricycle, kids learn to turn the handlebars the wrong way, which must be unlearned later. Balance bikes have been made out of both metal and wood. They can have no brake, or they can have one or two hand-activated rim brakes. A modern 'balance bicycle' is purpose-designed for little kids. It is an American architect who has designed many buildings, including the world’s tallest structure, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, as well as the Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia. He was the building projected to surpass Jeddhah Tower, in Saudi Saudi Arabia, which was the first building to surpass the world's tallest building. He has also designed many other world-class buildings, such as the world. tallest building, Burj. Khalifa, in Dubai. He is the son of American architect D.

In 2006, Adrian founded Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture (AS+GG), which is dedicated to the design of high-performance, energy-efficient and sustainable architecture. Smith's work at SOM has been featured in museums in the United States, South America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. He was the recipient of the CTBUH 2011 Lynn S. Beedle Lifetime Achievement Award. Smith designed over 125 awards including 5 international awards, 9 National American Institute of Architects Awards, 35 State and Chicago AIA Awards, and 3 Urban Land Institute Awards for Excellence. He is a Senior Fellow of the Design Futures Council, and in May 2013, he was awarded an Honoraries Doctorate in Architecture by Texas A &M University, where he was a member of the Corps of Cadets for more than 30 years. Smith is married to his longtime partner and business partner, Susan Smith, and has three children. He has a son and a daughter, both of whom he has worked with at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill since the early 1980s. He also has a stepson and a stepdaughter who are both architects and live in the U.S. The couple has a daughter who lives in New York City and a son who is studying at the University of Illinois, Chicago. Smith has been married to Susan since the late 1970s and has two children. His son is also a well-known architect, having worked on the construction of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, Dubai, and the One World Trade Center in Manhattan, New York, among other notable projects.

On learning of the ban, students at UWI, Mona began a demonstration under the leadership of the Guild of Undergraduates, closing down the campus. They then proceeded to march first to the prime minister's residence, and then to the parliament building in Kingston. On the way many more demonstrators joined in, and eventually the disturbance became increasingly violent spreading across the city. Eventually, several people were killed and there were millions of dollars in property damages. The riots were part of an emerging black consciousness movement in the Caribbean, and played a role in the mutiny of soldiers in Trinidad and Tobago two years later. ""Give me liberty, or give me death!"" is a quotation attributed to Patrick Henry from a speech he made to the Virginia Convention on March 23, 1775, at St. John's Church in Richmond, Virginia. On January 14, 2013, former The Facts of Life star and Survivor: Philippines contestant Lisa Whelchel joined Probst as co-host for several episodes. The Jeff Probst Show airs in Singapore at 2pm Weekdays on MediaCorp Channel 5. In South Africa, the show airs weekdays at 6pm on SABC3. The show follows the same general interest format platform as Anderson Live, Katie and The Ricki Lake Show; the latter two debuted at the same time as Probst's. Each episode is one hour long and centered on a topic in which guests and audience members interact about to find a common ground. Jeff will randomly initiate an ""Ambush Adventure"" when he asks a guest on the show or an audience member to take a step outside their comfort zone. Once the participant agrees to the Ambush Adventure, they find out the adventure. The series has moved from an afternoon time slot to a late night.  Despite the series finale airing May 22, 2013,. unaired episodes were aired during the summer.  The show was canceled on February 13, 2013 after only one season. It was co-produced by Big Ticket Television, and distributed by CBS Television Distribution, which handles the distribution rights in the United States and Canada. The phrase appears in other nationalist contexts. The national anthem of Uruguay, Orientales, contains the line ¡Libertad o con gloria morir! (Liberty or with glory to die!) In March 1941 the motto of the public demonstrations in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia against signing the treaty with Nazi Germany was ""Better grave than slave"" (Bolje grob nego rob) In China, a 25-year-old former college student ""village official"" was given a two-year re-education through labor sentence for an online anti-CPC speech. A T-shirt of Ren's saying ""Give me liberty or give me death!"" (in Chinese) has been taken as evidence of his anti-social guilt. The phrase ""liberty or death"" also appears on the Culpeper Minutemen flag of 1775. The play, Cato, a Tragedy, was popular in the Colonies and well known by the Founding Fathers, who would quote from the play. The word ""Liberty"" is also used in the name of a UK Parliament constituency, Surrey Heath, in the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies before the general election in 2010. It is also the title of a play by George Washington, ""It is not now time to talk of aught/But chains or conquest, liberty or death,"" (Act II, Scene 4). The phrase is also found on the U.S. flag of the time, and on the American flag of that time, as well as on the British flag, the Queen's Jubilee flag, and the British Queen's Cup. The U.K. Parliament constituency of Surrey Heath is represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2005 by Michael Gove, a Conservative. It has electoral wards: Bagshot, Bisley, Chobham, Frimley, Frimsley Green, Heatherside, Lightwater, Mytchett and Deepcut, Old Dean, St Paul's Town, Watchett, and Windlesham in the South and Ton Vale, and Asharf in the Borough of Guildford. The largest town is Camberley, with no boundary changes made for Surrey Heath in the Boundary Commission for Westminster before the 2010 general election. The large village of Ash Vale with Ash Vale and smaller one of Tongham are contiguous with Frimleys Green and Frimly Green. stituency was created in 1997 from the most part of the seat of North West Surrey (which was abolished) and smaller parts of Woking and Guildford, seats which remain. In terms of housing 70% of homes are detached or semi-detached at the 2011 census. The area is well connected to London Heathrow Airport, IT, telecommunications and logistics centres of the M3 and M4 'corridors' and to the military towns of Aldershot and Sandhurst. According to the British Election Study, it is the most right-wing seat in the UK. The constituency is one of the Conservative party's safest seats, with most wards firmly in their camp, the exception being the Old Dean ward which usually votes Labour at local level. In 2004 the Conservative constituency association, then the richest in the country, deselected their MP Nick Hawkins in the hope of obtaining an MP of Cabinet calibre. The current MP for Surrey Heath is Gabriel Milland, who is also the Secretary of State for Education for England and Wales. He has been in Parliament since 2005 and is a former Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary."

John Glenn Returns to Space
Thirty-six years after he rode a cramped Mercury capsule to become the first American to orbit Earth, on Feb. 20, 1962, and 24 years after the trajectory of fame landed him in the U.S. Senate, John Glenn  suited up again as an astronaut. On Oct. 29, 1998, at the age of 77, he became the oldest person ever to fly in space, a hero of the Cold War stepping forward this time as a role model for the geriatric generation -- and to satisfy an unending yearning.

The King Richard III Stakes is a Listed flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. It is run over a distance of 7 furlongs and 9 yards (1,416 metres) at Leicester in April.

History

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the event was known as the Philip Cornes Trophy Stakes.  It was renamed the Leicestershire Stakes in 1983. 

Holsten Brewery started to sponsor the race in 1984, and from this point it was called the Holsten Pils Trophy.  It reverted to its previous title in 1988.

For a period the Leicestershire Stakes held Listed status. It was promoted to Group 3 level in 1999, and relegated back to Listed class in 2004.

The race was given its present title in 2013. It is now named after King Richard III, whose skeleton was discovered in Leicester and identified earlier that year.

Passage:
There's a sucker born every minute
""There's a sucker born every minute"" is a phrase closely associated with P. T. Barnum, an American showman of the mid-19th century, although there is no evidence that he said it. Early examples of its use are found instead among gamblers and confidence men.

Attribution to Barnum

When Barnum's biographer, Arthur H. Saxon, tried to track down  Barnum had uttered this phrase, he was unable to verify it. According to Saxon, ""There's no contemporary account of it, or even any suggestion that the word 'sucker' was used in the derogatory sense in his day. Barnum was just not the type to disparage his patrons."" 

Some sources claim the quote is most likely from famous con-man Joseph (""Paper Collar Joe"") Bessimer,  and other sources say it was actually uttered by David Hannum, spoken in reference to Barnum's part in the Cardiff Giant hoax. Hannum, who was exhibiting the ""original"" giant and had unsuccessfully sued Barnum for exhibiting a copy and claiming it was the original, was referring to the crowds continuing to pay to see Barnum's exhibit even after both it and the original had been proven to be fakes.

Another source credits late 1860s Chicago ""bounty broker, saloon and gambling-house keeper, eminent politician, and dispenser of cheating privileges..."" Michael Cassius McDonald as the originator of the aphorism. According to the book Gem of the Prairie: Chicago Underworld (1940) by Herbert Asbury, when McDonald was equipping his gambling house known as The Store (at Clark and Monroe Streets in Chicago) his partner Harry Lawrence expressed concern over the large number of roulette wheels and faro tables being installed and their ability to get enough players to play the games. McDonald then allegedly said, ""Don't worry about that, there's a sucker born every minute.""

History

Early uses of the phrase refer to it as a catch-phrase among gamblers. In an 1879 discussion of gambling in Chicago, an ""old-timer"" is quoted as saying, “[G]oodness knows how they live, it’s mighty hard times with the most of them; in the season they make a bit on base ball, or on the races, and then, you know, ‘there’s a sucker born every minute,’ and rigid city legislation drives the hard-up gambler, who would be a decent one of the kind, to turn skin-dealer and sure-thing player.”  The use of quotation marks indicates that it must already have been an established catch-phrase.

The phrase appears in print in the 1885 biography of confidence man Hungry Joe, The Life of Hungry Joe, King of the Bunco Men.   

In a slightly different form, the phrase shows up in the January 1806 European Magazine: ""It was the observation of one of the tribe of Levi, to whom some person had expressed his astonishment at his being able to sell his damaged and worthless commodities, 'That there vash von fool born every minute.'"" 

According to David W. Maurer, writing in The Big Con (1940),  there was a similar saying amongst con men: ""There's a mark born every minute, and one to trim 'em and one to knock 'em.""  Here ""trim"" means to steal from, and ""knock"" means to persuade away from a scam.  The meaning is that there is no shortage of new victims, nor of con men, nor of honest men.

In the 1930 John Dos Passos novel The 42nd Parallel, the quotation is attributed to Mark Twain.
Question:
“There’s a sucker born every minute” is a phrase erroneously attributed to what famous showman?
Answer:
Phineas Barnum

Royal Yacht Squadron
The Royal Yacht Squadron is one of the most prestigious yacht clubs in the world. Its clubhouse is Cowes Castle on the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom.  Member yachts are given the Suffix RYS to their names, and permitted to fly the White Ensign of the Royal Navy[http://www.rys.org.uk/da/11662 Overview: The Royal Yacht Squadron] rather than the merchant Red Ensign flown by the majority of other UK registered vessels. The club's patron is Queen Elizabeth II and the club's admiral is Prince Philip who is also a former club commodore.

History

Founded on 1 June 1815 in the Thatched House Tavern in St James's, London as The Yacht Club by 42 gentlemen interested in sea yachting,[http://www.british-towns.net/attractions/attraction_selected.asp?GetTLID3336 British Attractions – Royal Yacht Squadron – Outdoor Venue] the original members decided to meet in London and in Cowes twice a year, to discuss yachting over dinner. Membership was restricted to those who owned a vessel not under 10 tons. Today this is interpreted as a gentleman ""actively interested in yachting"".[http://www.rys.org.uk/da/11662 Overview: The Royal Yacht Squadron]

The Earl of Yarborough, later first commodore of the club, welcomed the Prince Regent as a member in 1817. In 1820, when the Prince Regent became George IV, it was renamed the Royal Yacht Club.

The club started organising racing as a principal feature of the annual regatta, which is now known as Cowes Week. In 1833, William IV renamed the club, The Royal Yacht Squadron.
Its association with the Royal Navy began early and Nelson's captain at Trafalgar, Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy, headed the list of naval members. The spirit of invention led to yachts ""of such celerity in sailing and beauty of construction"" that they were of utility to the Royal Navy.
In 1829, the Admiralty issued a warrant to wear what is now the navy's White Ensign. The burgee (a triangular shaped flag identifying yacht club membership) is differenced with a St George's Cross and crown on a white background.

In 1851, one of the ""forred"" hands, on board the yacht America concerning the first sailing of the America's Cup, 1851 wrote 'The Royal Yacht Club—In a fix' (tune). ""Come listen to my ditty, and a song to you I'll sing..."" 

Another naval connection is that the Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. To enable the application of naval discipline on board a civilian ship, he registered the Terra Nova RYS as a yacht of the squadron and sailed under the White Ensign on his second and final expedition to Antarctica in 1910.

Recently, Royal Yacht Squadron allowed full membership to women, which had been restricted since its foundation.

Racing

In 1851, the club's commodore, visiting the Great Exhibition, issued a challenge for the squadron's £100 Cup for a race around the island. The New York City–based America, representing the New York Yacht Club, triumphed in this race, giving its name to one of the oldest and best-known trophies: the America's Cup.  The victory was witnessed by Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales, later commodore of the club and Edward VII.

The site is also used as the start of the Round the Island Race which occurs annually.

During the American Civil War Deerhound RYS witnessed the fight between USS Kearsarge and the Confederate cruiser CSS Alabama. Gazelle RYS rescued the Empress Eugenie at the end of the Franco-Prussian War and the squadron yachts supplied British soldiers in the Crimean War.

The German Kaiser brought the 1887 America's Cup challenger Thistle, to Cowes in 1892 which encouraged the Prince of Wales to build Britannia, one of the most successful racing yachts of all time.

The Pavilion

The Pavilion, designed by Sir Thomas Croft, was opened in 2000. This elegant creation provides on shore facilities for yachtsmen and their families while allowing the castle to retain its 'country house' ambiance. The Pavilion also enabled the squadron to cross burgees with the New York Yacht Club in celebration of the 150th anniversary of the schooner America’s famous victory of 1851.

Belgrade Theatre
The Belgrade Theatre is a live performance venue seating 858 and situated in Coventry, England. It was the first civic theatre to be built after the Second World War in Britain and as such was more than a place of entertainment. It joined the new Coventry Cathedral as a symbol of optimism and culture in one of the largest re-development projects then undertaken, to rebuild the city of Coventry, which had been almost totally destroyed by bombing. The building is now a grade II listed building. In 1963 the Belgrade was registered as a charity by the Charity Commission (number 219163). 
The Belgrade acquired its name in recognition and thanks for a gift of timber from the Yugoslavian (today Serbian) capital city of Belgrade (Coventry's official sister city), that was used extensively in the construction of the auditorium. Since opening in 1958, the theatre has established itself as a centre for the new and innovative productions.

Having pioneered the Theatre-in-Education movement in the 1960s the theatre continues to work with disadvantaged young people and uses drama as a tool to develop personal and social skills. Their most successful programme ""Acting Out"" has been commissioned by Coventry's LEA for the last 10 years and has been replicated across the UK. One graduate of the course credits ""Acting Out"" with saving her life. 

The theatre reopened in September 2007 after undergoing a £12 million refurbishment with a 7-storey extension to provide a second auditorium.

Prince Edward officially opened the refurbishment of the Belgrade's B2 studio on 5 February 2008, this also marked the 50th anniversary of the Belgrade's opening performed by Princess Alexandra.

Chicken Forestiere Recipe - Pepper
Chicken Forestiere Recipe
Mikka Wee Words
A French classic, the term a la forestiere means “of the forest”, wherein a certain kind of meat is accompanied by earthy and hearty flavors, which usually come from mushrooms. And if you’re an occasional diner at the Old Swiss Inn, you’ll find that Chicken Forestiere is one of this European restaurant’s bestselling dishes.
And a creamy mushroom sauce, more often than not, is a tricky sauce to work with since too much can be quite overbearing to the palette. So we thinned it out in this recipe by using a splash of fine Madeira wine.
Buttered Linguini is the chosen partner carbohydrate for this meal, but you can also opt to substitute it with some mashed potatoes or a basic risotto. But personally, I believe the Buttered Linguini goes perfect with this since the simplicity of the side dish makes an excellent pairing for the sophisticatedly-dressed poultry. Bon appetit!
Chicken Forestiere with Buttered Linguini
Total Time: 40 minutes / Yield: 2 servings
Ingredients for the Chicken
Procedure for the Buttered Linguini
Prepare buttered linguini by melting butter in a pan.
Toss in cooked linguini and season with salt and pepper.

Dredge in all-purpose flour and place in a plate.
Heat olive oil in a sauté pan and pan fry chicken pieces for 1-2 minutes on each side or until browned. Be careful not to overcook.
Remove chicken pieces from pan and transfer to a plate, set aside.
Procedure for the Madeira Mushroom Sauce
In the same pan, add in butter and melt.
Sauté garlic and shallots for 1-2 minutes.
Add in mushroom slices and cook for another 2 minutes.
Add in Madeira wine and season with salt and pepper.
Add in water and simmer for 3-5 minutes or until alcohol evaporates. Add more water if it gets too dry.

Turn off fire and mix.
Serve with a side of the buttered linguini.
Notes
Paillard is an older French culinary term referring to a quick-cooking, thinly sliced or pounded piece of meat. In France, the word “escalope” has largely replaced it. The cut is known as “scallop” in the USA, not to be confused with the shellfish scallop.

Fluke
Fluke are an English electronic music group formed in the late 1980s by Mike Bryant, Jon Fugler and Mike Tournier with Julian Nugent as the band's manager. The band's conception was influenced by the members interest in the burgeoning acid house music scene and particularly the work of Cabaret Voltaire and Giorgio Moroder. The band are noted for their diverse range of electronic styles spanning the house, techno, ambient and blues genres; for their reclusivity, rarely giving interviews; and for lengthy timespans between albums. Many listeners know of Fluke only through the inclusion of their music in many blockbuster film soundtracks—most notably The Matrix Reloaded and Sin City—as well as featuring prominently on the soundtracks to Need for Speed: Underground 2 and the Wipeout video game series. The film The Experiment uses their song ""YKK"". To date Fluke have produced five original studio albums, two ""best of"" compilations and two live albums. Throughout their career they have made several changes to their line-up with credited appearances attributed to Neil Davenport playing guitars, Robin Goodridge on drums and Hugh Bryder as a DJ. When Fluke were touring for Risotto they were joined on stage by Rachel Stewart who acted as a personification of the band's official mascot, a character from the Wipeout series named Arial Tetsuo. Stewart continued as lead female vocalist and as a dancer for all of Fluke's live performances between 1997 and 1999.

Passage:
Apportionment Act of 1911
The Apportionment Act of 1911 (, ) was an apportionment bill passed by the United States Congress on August 8, 1911. The law set the number of members of the United States House of Representatives at 435, effective with the 63rd Congress on March 4, 1913.   This number included a provision for the addition of one seat each for Arizona and New Mexico when they became states.

Previous apportionment

The requirement for allocating United States Representatives is found in Article One, Section 2, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution.  Following each ten-year census, Congress is required to create a law that establishes the process of apportionment for the next ten years.  After the first census, Congress began to pass legislation to dictate the method of allotting U.S. Representatives to the states based on population (see Apportionment Act of 1792).  The Jefferson method of apportionment had been in use after the first census of 1790 through the 1830 census, and required fractional remainders to be discarded when calculating each state's total number of U.S. Representatives.      Daniel Webster proposed the Webster method, which was adopted for the 1840 census and allocated one representative to states with a fractional remainder greater than 0.5.   Prior to the Apportionment Act of 1911, the Hamilton/Vinton (largest remainder) method had been used for this purpose since 1850.        In addition to setting the number of U.S. Representatives at 435, the Apportionment Act of 1911 returned to the Webster method of apportionment of U.S. Representatives.  Adopted in 1868, Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution had already removed the three-fifths method of counting slaves, and instead required ""counting the whole number of all persons in each State.""

Text

Subsequent apportionment

For the first and only time, Congress failed to pass an apportionment act after the 1920 census.  This left the allocations of the Act of 1911 in place until the 1930 census.  The Reapportionment Act of 1929 established a method for reallocating seats among the states, given population shifts and the maximum of 435 representatives.   The Apportionment Act of 1941 made the apportionment process self-executing after each decennial census.   This lifted Congress's responsibility to pass an apportionment act for each census, and ensured that the events surrounding the 1920 census would not happen again.  The number of U.S. Representatives increased temporarily to 437 when Alaska and Hawaii were admitted as states during the 86th Congress (seating one member from each of those states without changing the apportionment of the other seats).  After the 1960 census and the 1962 election, that number went back to 435.

Public Law 62-5, which was passed on August 8, 1911 set the membership of the House of Representatives to what number?

Passage:
Tagus
The Tagus (; ; ; Ancient Greek: Τάγος Tagos) is the longest river on the Iberian Peninsula.  It is 1038 km long, 716 km in Spain, 47 km along the border between Portugal and Spain and 275 km in Portugal, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean near Lisbon.  It drains an area of 80100 sqkm (the second largest in the Iberian peninsula after the Douro).  The Tagus is highly utilized for most of its course. Several dams and diversions supply drinking water to most of central Spain, including Madrid, and Portugal, while dozens of hydroelectric stations create power. Between dams it follows a very constricted course, but after Almourol it enters a vast alluvial valley prone to flooding. At its mouth is a large estuary on which the port city of Lisbon is situated.

The source of the Tagus is the Fuente de García, in the Frías de Albarracín municipal term, Montes Universales, Sistema Ibérico, Sierra de Albarracín Comarca. All its major tributaries enter the Tagus from the right (north) bank.  The main cities it passes through are Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera de la Reina and Alcántara in Spain, and Abrantes, Santarém, Almada and Lisbon in Portugal.

Course

In Spain

The first notable city on the Tagus is Sacedón. Below Aranjuez it receives the combined flow of the Jarama,  Henares, Algodor and Tajuña.  Below Toledo it receives the Guadarrama River.  Above Talavera de la Reina it receives the Alberche.  At Valdeverdeja is the upper end of the long upper reservoir, the Embalse de Valdecañas, beyond which are the Embalse de Torrejon, into which flow the Tiétar, and the lower reservoir, the Alcántara Dam into which flows the Alagón at the lower end.

There is a canal and aqueduct between the Tagus and the Segura.

In Portugal

After forming the border it enters Portugal, passing Vila Velha de Ródão, Abrantes, Constância, Entroncamento, Santarém and Vila Franca de Xira at the head of the long narrow estuary, which has Lisbon at its mouth. The estuary is protected by the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve. There is the largest bridge across the river, the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which with a total length of  is the longest bridge in Europe.

The Portuguese Alentejo region and former Ribatejo Province take their names from the river; Alentejo, from além Tejo ""Beyond the Tagus"" and Ribatejo from arriba Tejo, an archaic way of saying ""Upper Tagus"".

Geology

The lower Tagus is on a fault line. Slippage along it has caused numerous earthquakes, the major ones being those of 1309, 1531 and 1755. 

History

The Pepper Wreck, properly the wreck of the Nossa Senhora dos Mártires, is a shipwreck located and excavated at the mouth of the Tagus between 1996 and 2001.

The river had strategic value to the Spanish and Portuguese empires, as it guarded the approach to Lisbon. For example, in 1587, Sir Francis Drake briefly approached the river after his successful raid at Cadiz. 

Popular culture

A major river, the Tagus is brought to mind in the songs and stories of the Portuguese. A popular fado song in Lisbon notes that while people get older, the Tagus remains young (""My hair getting white, the Tagus is always young""). The author, Fernando Pessoa, wrote a poem that begins: 
""The Tagus is more beautiful than the river that flows through my village. But the Tagus is not more beautiful than the river that flows through my village..."" 

Richard Crashaw's poem ""Saint Mary Magdalene, or the Weeper"" refers to the ""Golden"" Tagus as wanting Mary Magdalene's silver tears. In classical poetry the Tagus was famous for its gold-bearing sands (Catullus 29.19, Ovid, Amores, 1.15.34, Juvenal, Satires, 3.55, etc.).

Documents by the 19th-Century British Poet Laureates
The post of British Poet Laureate has existed in some form since 1189, and though it was traditionally a position held for life, it is now held for a period of ten years. During the 19th century, five different men held the post, though Henry James Pye was appointed in the late 18th century and served until 1813, and Alfred Austin was appointed in 1896 and served most of his term during the early 20th century. The three men who served in between those two, and who indeed served for 83 of the years of the 19th century, were Robert Southey (served 1813-1843), William Wordsworth (served 1843-1850), and Alfred, Lord Tennyson (served 1850-1892).

Kittiwake
The kittiwakes (genus Rissa) are two closely related seabird species in the gull family Laridae, the black-legged kittiwake (R. tridactyla) and the red-legged kittiwake (R. brevirostris).   The epithets ""black-legged"" and ""red-legged"" are used to distinguish the two species in North America, but in Europe, where R. brevirostris is not found, the black-legged kittiwake is often known simply as kittiwake, or more colloquially in some areas as tickleass or tickleace.  The name is derived from its call, a shrill 'kittee-wa-aaake, kitte-wa-aaake'. The genus name Rissa is from the Icelandic name Rita for the black-legged kittiwake.

Description

The two species are physically very similar. They have a white head and body, grey back, grey wings tipped solid black and a yellow bill. Black-legged kittiwake adults are somewhat larger (roughly 40 cm in length with a wingspan of 90 –) than red-legged kittiwakes (35 – in length with a wingspan around 84 –). Other differences include a shorter bill, larger eyes, a larger, rounder head and darker grey wings in the red-legged kittiwake. While most black-legged kittiwakes do, indeed, have dark-grey legs, some have pinkish-grey to reddish legs, making colouration a somewhat unreliable identifying marker.

In contrast to the dappled chicks of other gull species, kittiwake chicks are downy and white since they are under relatively little threat of predation, as the nests are on extremely steep cliffs. Unlike other gull chicks which wander around as soon as they can walk, kittiwake chicks instinctively sit still in the nest to avoid falling off.  Juveniles take three years to reach maturity. When in winter plumage, both birds have a dark grey smudge behind the eye and a grey hind-neck collar. The sexes are visually indistinguishable.

Distribution and habitat

Kittiwakes are coastal breeding birds ranging in the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Arctic oceans.  They form large, dense, noisy colonies during the summer reproductive period, often sharing habitat with murres. They are the only gull species that are exclusively cliff-nesting.

The black-legged kittiwake is one of the most numerous of seabirds. Breeding colonies can be found in the Pacific from the Kuril Islands, around the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk throughout the Bering Sea and the Aleutian Islands to southeast Alaska,  and in the Atlantic from the Gulf of St. Lawrence through Greenland and the coast of Ireland down to Portugal, as well as in the high Arctic islands.   In the winter, the range extends further south and out to sea.

In sharp contrast, the red-legged kittiwake has a very limited range in the Bering Sea, breeding only on the Pribilof, Bogoslof and Buldir islands in the United States, and the Commander Islands in Russia.  On these islands, it shares some of the same cliff habitat as the black-legged kittiwake, though there is some localized segregation between the species on given cliffs.

The Bishop of London is the Diocesan Bishop for the London Diocese, which covers London, north of the Thames. He also exercises personal responsibility for the ‘Two Cities’ Area of the Diocese, covering the City of London and the City of Westminster.
Richard John Carew Chartres became the 132nd Bishop of London in November 1995 and was enthroned at St Paul’s on 26 January 1996. He was educated at Hertford Grammar School and studied history at Trinity College Cambridge. Before ordination he taught Ancient History at the International School in Seville.

It is run over a distance of 7furlongs and 9yards (1,416 metres) at Leicester in April. The race was given its present title in 2013 and is named after King Richard III, whose skeleton was discovered in Leicester and identified earlier that year. The phrase ""There's a sucker born every minute"" is a phrase closely associated with P. T. Barnum, an American showman of the mid-19th century, although there is no evidence that he said it. Early examples of its use are found instead among gamblers and confidence men. The quotation marks indicate that it must be al al-thing and that it is not to be used in a derogatory sense. The 2012 running was abandoned due to waterlogging, and the race was held at Doncaster in 2000, and Newmarket in 2001. It was promoted to Group 3 level in 1999, and relegated back to Listed class in 2004. In an 1879 discussion of gambling, an ""old-timer"" is quoted as saying “[G]oodness knows how they live, it’s mighty hard times with the most of them; they make a bit of a bit on the base, or on the races, and then you know you know, ‘there’re a sucker built every minute’” The quote is most likely from famous con-man Joseph (""Paper Collar Joe"") Bessimer,  and other sources say it was actually uttered by David Hannum, spoken in reference to Barnum's part in the Cardiff Giant hoax. Some sources claim it was uttered by Michael Cassius McDonald, a saloon and gambling-house keeper in Chicago in the 1860s. It has been used as a catch-phrase since at least the 1970s and 1980s by gamblers, and is still widely used today. The quote has also been used to refer to gamblers in the U.S. and Australia. It can be found in the book Gem of the Prairie: Chicago Underworld (1940) by Herbert Asbury, by Herbert. Asbury. The book is a collection of the best-known and lesser-known stories about gambling in the United States and around the world, including the works of William Makepeace Thackeray, Oscar Wilde, Charles Dickens, and others. The Royal Yacht Squadron is one of the most prestigious yacht clubs in the world. Its clubhouse is Cowes Castle on the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. Member yachts are given the Suffix RYS to their names, and permitted to fly the White Ensign of the Royal Navy. The club's patron is Queen Elizabeth II and the commodiral is Prince Philip who is also a former club member. The original membership was restricted to those who owned a vessel not under 10 tons. Today this is interpreted as a gentleman inactively interested in yachting. The members of the club are invited to meet twice a year, in Cowes and St James' House, London, to discuss yachtting over dinner. For more information, visit the club’s website or its official Facebook page, or visit www.royalyachtsquadron.org.uk/yacht-sport/yachting-sparks-tickets-and-tournament-ticket-bait-t-treats-for-more-than-you-can-afford-to-get-a-free-gift-from-the-royal- yacht-squadral-club-on-the Isle-of-Wight-in-UK-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-15.

The New York City–based America, representing the New York Yacht Club, triumphed in this race, giving its name to one of the oldest and best-known trophies: the America's Cup. The Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott was a member of the squadron. The Pavilion, designed by Sir Thomas Croft, was opened in 2000. The Belgrade Theatre is a live performance venue seating 858 and situated in Coventry, England. It was the first civic theatre to be built after the Second World War in Britain and as such was more than a place of entertainment. In 1963 the Belgrade was registered as a charity by the Charity Commission (number 219163). It acquired its name in recognition of a gift of timber from the Yugoslavian (today Serbian) city of Belgrade (Coventry's official capital) The building is now a grade II listed building. Since its opening in 1817, the club has hosted the annual regatta, which is now known as Cowes Week. The club started organising racing as a principal feature of the annual Regatta. In 1829, the Admiralty issued a warrant to wear what is now the now the navy's White Ensign. The burgee (a triangular shaped flag identifying yacht club membership) is differenced with a St George's Cross and crown on a white background on a black background. The Royal Yachts supplied British soldiers in the Crimean War. The German Kaiser brought the 1887 America's Cups challenger Thistle, to Cowes in 1892 which encouraged the Prince of Wales to build Britannia, one of most successful racing yachts of all time. The squadron also enabled the squadron to cross burgees with the 150th anniversary of the schooner America’s famous victory of 1851. The Queen Victoria and Edward VII, later commodore of the club, were both members of the Royal Y yacht Squadron. It is also used as the start of the Round the Island Race which occurs annually. The yacht club's commodore, visiting the Great Exhibition, issued a challenge for the squadron's £100 Cup for a race around the island. The Belgrade Theatre opened in 1958. The theatre pioneered the Theatre-in-Education movement in the 1960s. It continues to work with disadvantaged young people and uses drama as a tool to develop personal and social skills. Their most successful programme ""Acting Out"" has been commissioned by Coventry's LEA for the last 10 years and has been replicated across the UK.

Fluke are an English electronic music group formed in the late 1980s by Mike Bryant, Jon Fugler and Mike Tournier with Julian Nugent as the band's manager.

To date Fluke have produced five original studio albums, two ""best of"" compilations and two live albums. When Fluke were touring for Risotto they were joined on stage by Rachel Stewart who acted as a personification of their official mascot, a character from the Wipeout series named Arial Tetsuo. The film The Experiment uses their song ""YKK"". Many listeners know of Fluke only through the inclusion of their music in many blockbuster film soundtracks—most notably The Matrix Reloaded and Sin City—as well as featuring prominently on the soundtracks to Need for Speed: Underground 2 and the W wipeout video game series.

The word fluke means one of the triangular blades at the end of an anchor, designed to catch the ground. The fluke of the anchor was wedged between two outcroppings of rock and could not be dislodged. It is a metal hook on the head of certain staff weapons (such as a bill), made in various forms depending on function, whether used for grappling or to penetrate armour when swung at an opponent. The polearm had a wide, sharpened fluke attached to the central point. It's an offshoot from a central piece of metal, such as a bronze statue.

It drains an area of 80100 sqkm (the second largest in the Iberian peninsula after the Douro) The main cities it passes through are Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera de la Reina and Alcántara in Spain. At its mouth is a large estuary on which the port city of Lisbon is situated. There is the largest bridge across the river, the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which with a total length of  is the longest bridge in Europe. The Pepper Wreck, properly the wreck of the Nossa Senhora dos Mrtires, is a shipwreck located and excavated at the mouth of the Tagus. The river had strategic value to the Spanish and Portuguese empires, as it gushed into the Atlantic Ocean between 1996 and 2001. It is on a fault line that has caused numerous earthquakes, the major ones being those of 1309, 1531 and 1755. The Tagus has been named after the Portuguese town of Alentejo, from alm Tejo, which means ""an way of way"" or ""the way of the gods"" The river is the second largest river in the world after the River Seville, which is also named after a Spanish town. It empties into the ocean near Lisbon, where it is known as the ""River of the Gods"" or the ""Rio de Janeiro"" River is a tributary of the River Algarve, which flows into the River Estuary of the Bay of Biscay. It has been called the ""most important river in Europe"" since the Roman conquest of the 6th century. It was named after its source, the Fuente de García, in the Frías de Albarracín municipal term, Montes Universales, Sistema Ibérico, Sierra de Albaracín Comarca. All its major tributaries enter the Tagos from the right (north) bank. The River is on the fault line which has caused many earthquakes, including those of the 1309 and 1531, being caused by the major fault line of the Wreck of the Pepper W wreck, which was excavated in 1996. It also has a number of smaller faults, including the Jarama, Henares, Algodor and Tajuña. The post of British Poet Laureate has existed in some form since 1189. During the 19th century, five different men held the post, though Henry James Pye was appointed in the late 18th century and served until 1813. The three men who served in between those two, and who indeed served for 83 of the years of the early 20th century were Robert Southey, William Wordsworth, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Documents by all three of these men in The Frellsen Fletcher Smith Collection, including handwritten poems by all of them, can be found at Louisiana Tech University. For more information about these documents click on the author links to the left. The kittiwakes (genus Rissa) are two closely related seabird species in the gull family Laridae, the black-legged tridactyla (R. tridyla) and the red-legged kittwake (Rissa brevirostris) The name Rissa is from the Icelandic name Rita, which means 'tickle' or 'kitte-wa-aa' The name tickle is derived from its call, a shrill 'kite', a call that some areas of Europe use to refer to a tickle-like bird. The word tickle can also be used as a derogatory term for a person or a group of people, such as a gang of thugs or drug dealers, or for a gang that has been on the run from the police for some time. The River Tagus is a major river in Portugal, and was used by Sir Francis Drake during his successful raid at Cadiz in 1587. A popular fado song in Lisbon notes that while people get older, the Tagus remains young (""My hair getting white, theTagus is always young""). The Tagus was famous for its gold-bearing sands (Catullus 29.19, Ovid, Amores, 1.15.34, Juvenal, Satires, 3.55, etc.) In classical poetry, the river is referred to as the ""Golden"" Tagus in the poem ""Saint Mary Magdalene, or the Weeper"" Richard Crashaw's poem ""The Golden Tagus"" refers to the 'Golden' Tagus as wanting Mary Mag Dalene's silver tears. The river's name means 'the river that flows through my village' in Portuguese. It is also the name of the Portuguese city of Lisbon, which lies on its banks. Kittiwakes are coastal breeding birds ranging in the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Arctic oceans. Breeding colonies can be found in the Pacific from the Kuril Islands, around the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk throughout the Bering Sea and the Aleutian Islands to southeast Alaska. They form large, dense, noisy colonies during the summer reproductive period, often sharing habitat with murres. They are the only gull species that are exclusively cliff-nesting. They have a white head and body, grey back, grey wings tipped solid black and a yellow bill. When in winter plumage, both birds have a dark grey smudge behind the eye and a grey hind-neck collar. The sexes are visually indistinguishable.

Passage:
Leopold Bloom
Leopold Bloom is the fictional protagonist and hero of James Joyce's Ulysses. His peregrinations and encounters in Dublin on 16 June 1904 mirror, on a more mundane and intimate scale, those of Ulysses/Odysseus in Homer's epic poem the Odyssey. The character was inspired by James Joyce's close friend Aron Ettore Schmitz (Italo Svevo), author of Zeno's Conscience.

Bloom is introduced to the reader as a man of appetites: 

Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes. Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.

The Bloom character, born in 1866, is the only son of Rudolf Virág (a Hungarian Jew from Szombathely who emigrated to Ireland, converted from Judaism to Protestantism, changed his name to Rudolph Bloom and later committed suicide), and of Ellen Higgins, an Irish Protestant. He is uncircumcised. They lived in Clanbrassil Street, Portobello. Bloom converted to Catholicism to marry Marion (Molly) Tweedy on 8 October 1888. The couple have one daughter, Millicent (Milly), born in 1889; their son Rudolph (Rudy), born in December 1893, died after 11 days. The family live at 7 Eccles Street in Dublin.

Episodes (chapters) in Ulysses relate a series of encounters and incidents in Bloom's contemporary odyssey through Dublin in the course of the single day of 16 June 1904 (although episodes 1 to 3, 9 and to a lesser extent 7, are primarily concerned with Stephen Dedalus, who in the plan of the story is the counterpart of Telemachus). Joyce aficionados celebrate 16 June as 'Bloomsday'.

As the day unfolds, Bloom's thoughts turn to the affair between Molly and her manager, Hugh 'Blazes' Boylan (obliquely, through, for instance, telltale ear worms), and, prompted by the funeral of his friend Paddy Dignam, the death of his child, Rudy. The absence of a son may be what leads him to take a shine to Stephen, for whom he goes out of his way in the book's latter episodes, rescuing him from a brothel, walking him back to his own house and even offering him a place there to study and work. The reader becomes familiar with Bloom's tolerant, humanistic outlook, his penchant for voyeurism and his (purely epistolary) infidelity. Bloom detests violence, and his relative indifference to Irish nationalism leads to disputes with some of his peers (most notably 'the Citizen' in the Cyclops chapter). Although Bloom has never been a practising Jew, converted to Roman Catholicism to marry Molly, and has in fact received Christian baptism on three different occasions, he is of partial Jewish descent and is sometimes ridiculed and threatened because of his being perceived as a Jew. 

Elsewhere in popular culture

Writer-director Mel Brooks used the name ""Leo Bloom"" for the mousy accountant in his film/musical The Producers. Leo is a nervous accountant, prone to panic attacks, who keeps a security blanket to calm himself. Nevertheless it is Leo who has the idea of how to make money from a failed play. In the 2005 film, after realizing his inner potential, Leo loudly asks ""When's it gonna be Bloom's Day?"" Hidden in the background of the office of Max Bialystock is a calendar marked for June 16th, which is Bloomsday.

Former Pink Floyd bandmate Roger Waters references Leopold Bloom in his song ""Flickering Flame"" as sitting with Molly Malone.

It has also been suggested by Jeffrey Meyer in ""Orwell's Apocalypse: Coming Up For Air, Modern Fiction Studies"" that George Orwell's primary character George Bowling in Coming Up For Air was modelled on Leopold Bloom.

Leopold Bloom also serves as an archetype, due to his non-identity and political indifference, for the nihilistic and apathetic mass in contemporary society in the French radical fringe publication Tiqqun.

Grace Slick's song ""Rejoyce"", from the album After Bathing at Baxter's concerns the novel Ulysses, and Bloom is mentioned in the song.

Leo Bloom King is the protagonist and narrator of Pat Conroy's 2009 novel South of Broad. His mother is a huge fan of Joyce.

The world's youngest self-made billionaires
Forbes 3/9/2016 Kate Vinton
Youngest Self-Made Billionaires Click through the slideshow above to see the world's youngest self-made billionaires.
A record 66 members of the 2016 Forbes Billionaires List are under the age of 40. Of those, an impressive 36 built their fortunes themselves. Nearly three-quarters of these self-made billionaires got rich in the tech sector, with half of the tech fortunes coming from so-called “Unicorns” – private startups valued by investors at $1 billion or more. Many of these companies, like Snapchat, Uber, Pinterest and Airbnb, didn't even exist 10 years ago.
The youngest of these self-made mavens is 25-year-old Snapchat cofounder Evan Spiegel. In May, Snapchat raised $538 million in funding, valuing the ephemeral messaging company at $16 billion and increasing Spiegel's net worth to $2.1 billion. His Snapchat cofounder and Stanford friend, 27-year-old Bobby Murphy is the next youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1.8 billion.
Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg was the world's youngest billionaire when he debuted on the list in March 2008 at age 23 with a net worth of $1.5 billion. Today, the 31-year-old is not the youngest but he's definitely the richest by far of the under-40 crowd, with a net worth of $44.6 billion.
There is only one woman billionaire under 40 with a self-made fortune. Elizabeth Holmes, now 32, founded her blood-testing company Theranos at age 19. The company has come under fire in the past year for shipping an unapproved blood-collecting device and having unsafe lab practices, leading Forbes to lower our valuation of Theranos. Holmes, who owns half of Theranos, is worth an estimated $3.6 billion.

The probababilities of different numbers obtained by the throw of two dice offer a good introduction to the ideas of probability . For the throw of a single die, all outcomes are equally probable. But in the throw of two dice, the different possibilities for the total of the two dice are not equally probable because there are  more ways to get some numbers than others. There are six ways to get a total of 7, but only one way to get 2, so the ""odds"" of getting a 7 are six times those for getting ""snake eyes"". This simple example raises the idea of distinguishable states. For example, throwing a 3 is twice as likely as throwing a 2 because there are two distinguishable ways to get a 3.
The probability of getting a given value for the total on the dice may be calculated by taking the total number of ways that value can be produced and dividing it by the total number of distinguishable outcomes. So the probability of a 7 on the dice is 1/6 because it can be produced in 6 ways out of a total of 36 possible outcomes.

Of Dice and the Binomial Distribution
The throw of a die or the picking of a card out of a deck are perhaps the most visible examples of the statistics of random events. Most of the conceptual tasks in probability for these kind of events can be handled with the binomial distribution . The binomial distribution
can serve as a kind of ""multi-tool"" for common statistical questions.
Given one throw of a die, what is the probability of throwing a 2?
What is the probability of throwing two 2's in a row?
What is the probability that in six throws of the die you will not throw any  twos?
What is the probability that you will throw at least one 2 in six throws?
What is the average number of 2's that you would throw with a total of six throws of the die?
    The average number for a given outcome is the number of trials times the probability for that outcome. So the average is = np = 6(1/6) =1.
What is the probability that you will throw exactly one 2 in six throws?
Question:
What is the most likely total to result from a throw of a pair of dice?
Answer:
Seven
Passage:
Whorl (botany)
In botany, a whorl is an arrangement of sepals, petals, leaves, stipules or branches that radiate from a single point and surround or wrap around the stem.   A whorl consists of at least three elements; a pair of opposite leaves is not called a whorl.

The morphology of most Angiosperm flowers is based on four whorls: 
#the calyx, a whorl of sepals at the base, above which are
#the corolla, a whorl of petals, 
#the androecium, a whorl of stamens (each comprising a filament and an anther), and
#the gynoecium, a whorl of the female parts of a flower: the stigma, style and ovary.

A flower lacking any of these floral structures is said to be incomplete or imperfect.  Not all flowers consist of whorls since the parts may instead be spirally arranged, as in Magnoliaceae.

For leaves to grow in whorls is fairly unusual except in plant species with very short internodes. It does however occur in some trees such as Brabejum stellatifolium and other Proteaceae, such as some Banksia species. In examples such as those illustrated, crowded internodes within the whorls alternate with long internodes between the whorls.
Question:
The outer whorl of a flower is called a calyx . What is the plural form of the word?
Answer:
Calyx
Passage:
Helvetia
Helvetia is the female national personification of Switzerland, officially  Confœderatio Helvetica, the Swiss Confederation. The Goddess Helvetia or the Goddess Helvetica.

The allegory is typically pictured in a flowing gown, with a spear and a shield emblazoned with the Swiss flag, and commonly with braided hair, commonly with a wreath as a symbol of confederation. The name is a derivation of the ethnonym Helvetii, the name of the Gaulish tribe inhabiting the Swiss Plateau prior to the Roman conquest.

History

The fashion of depicting the Swiss Confederacy in terms of female allegories arises in the 17th century. This replaces an earlier convention, popular in the 1580s, of representing Switzerland as a bull (Schweizer Stier).

In the first half of the 17th century, there isn't a single allegory identified as Helvetia. Rather, a number of allegories are shown representing both virtues and vices of the confederacy. 
On the title page of his 1642 Topographia, Matthäus Merian shows two allegorical figures seated below the title panel: one is the figure of an armed Eidgenosse, representing Swiss military prowess or victory, the other is a female Abundantia allegory crowned with a city's ramparts, representing the Swiss territory or its fertility. 

Female allegories of individual cantons predate the single Helvetia figure. There are depictions of a Respublica Tigurina Virgo (1607), a Lucerna shown in 1658 with the victor of Villmergen, Christoph Pfyffer, and a Berna of 1682.

Over the next half-century, Merian's Abundantia would develop into the figure of Helvetia proper. An oil painting of 1677/78 from Solothurn, known as Libertas Helvetiae, shows a female Libertas allegory standing on a pillar.
In 1672, an oil painting by Albrecht Kauw shows a number of figures labelled Helvetia moderna. These represent vices such as Voluptas and Avaritia, contrasting with the virtues of Helvetia antiqua (not shown in the painting). 

On 14 September 1672, a monumental baroque play by Johann Caspar Weissenbach was performed in Zug, entitled Eydtgnossisch Contrafeth Auff- und Abnemmender Jungfrawen Helvetiae. 
The play is full of allegories illustrating the raise of Helvetia and her decadence after the Reformation. In the 4th act, the Abnemmende Helvetiae or ""Waning Helvetia"" is faced with Atheysmus and Politicus while the old virtues leave her. In the final scene, Christ himself appears to punish the wayward damsel, but the Mother of God and Bruder Klaus intercede and the contrite sinner is pardoned.

Identification of the Swiss as ""Helvetians"" (Hélvetiens) becomes common in the 18th century, particularly in the French language, as in François-Joseph-Nicolas d'Alt de Tieffenthal's very patriotic Histoire des Hélvetiens (1749–53)
followed by Alexander Ludwig von Wattenwyl's Histoire de la Confédération hélvetique (1754). Helvetia appears in patriotic and political artwork in the context of the construction of a national history and identity in the early 19th century, after the disintegration of the Napoleonic  Helvetic Republic, and she appears on official federal coins and stamps from the foundation of Switzerland as a federal state in 1848.

Name of Switzerland

The Swiss Confederation continues to use the name in its Latin form when it is inappropriate or inconvenient to use any or all of its four official languages. Thus, the name appears on postage stamps, coins and other uses; the full name, Confœderatio Helvetica, is abbreviated for uses such as the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and vehicle registration code CH, and the ccTLD, .ch.

Notably, translations of the term Helvetia still serve as the name for Switzerland in languages such as Irish, in which the country is known as An Eilvéis, Greek, in which it is known as Ελβετία (Elvetia) and Romanian, Elveţia. In Italian Elvezia is seen as archaic, but the demonym noun/adjective elvetico is used commonly as synonym of svizzero. In French, Swiss people may be referred to as Helvètes. The German word Helvetien is used as well as synonym of Schweiz and has a higher poetic value. Helvetien is also more common in Germany, the German-speaking Swiss use simply ""Helvetia"" or ""Helvecia"" as poetic synonym of their country.

Passage:
Tendring
Tendring is a local government district in north east Essex, England. It extends from the River Stour in the north, to the coast and the River Colne in the south, with the coast to the East and the town of Colchester to the west. Its council is based in Clacton-on-Sea.  Towns in the district include Frinton-on-Sea, Walton-on-the-Naze, Brightlingsea and Harwich. Large villages in the district include St Osyth and Great Bentley.

Sometimes referred to as the ""Tendring Peninsula"", the district was formed on 1 April 1974 as a merger of the borough of Harwich, with Brightlingsea, Clacton and Frinton and Walton urban districts, and Tendring Rural District.  The name Tendring comes from the ancient Tendring Hundred which is named after the small Tendring village at the centre of the area. The Tendring Poor Law Union covered the same area as the present district.

During the English civil war, the witch-finder general, Matthew Hopkins carried out many trials throughout this and the surrounding area especially in the town of Manningtree and village of Mistley on the River Stour.

The largest town in the Tendring district is Clacton-on-Sea, with a population of 53,000.

Etymology

There are these theories about the origin of its name:-
*From Anglo-Saxon tynder = ""tinder"": ""place where tinder or fuel is gathered.""
*From the German placename [http://www.planetware.com/hamelin/tundern-d-ni-hamt.htm Tündern] in Lower Saxony (old spelling Tundiriun) plus Anglo-Saxon -ing or -ingas: ""people who came across the sea from Tündern"".

Topography

The highest part of the district is a low (35 metres) ridge running west to east only 3 km south of the River Stour. The greater part of the district is undulating land sloping very gently to the south which is traversed by a number of streams.

Politics and local governance

Tendring District Council is currently in a state of No Overall Control (NOC) after the Local Elections in 2015. The Conservatives are the largest party with 23 out of the 60 available seats. The UK Independence Party with 22 seats, the Labour Party with 4 seats, the Holland-on-Sea Residents Association with 3 seats, the Liberal Democrats with 1 seat, Tendring First with 1 seat, and 6 independents were also elected. 

Prior to the 2015 elections, the council was controlled by the Conservatives who gained control of the authority in the 2011 local elections, holding 33 out of the 60 available seats. Tendring returns eight County Councillors to Essex County Council and at the 2013 local elections 4 seats were held by Conservatives, 2 won by UKIP, 1 won by Labour and 1 won by a Tendring First independent. 

In 2014 the Council was described as ""moronic"" and ""cretinous"" after it destroyed a mural by Banksy on a toilet block in Clacton-on-Sea. A member of the public had complained that the mural was 'racist'. 

Tendring's Golf Green ward contains the most deprived area in England and Wales,  and is currently held by two UKIP Councillors.

The Hajj Stampede: Why Do Crowds Run?
It usually isn’t about “panic.”

On Thursday, more than 700 people were killed in a stampede outside the holy city of Mecca. The disaster took place during the annual Hajj pilgrimage, which draws about 2 million Muslims to Saudi Arabia each year.
Although this was the deadliest Hajj episode in a quarter-century, it is a story that is sadly familiar . In Mina, where Thursday’s disaster took place, stampedes killed more than 360 people in 2006 and 244 in 2004. In the worst Hajj stampede, 1,426 pilgrims were crushed in a pedestrian tunnel leading to Mecca in 1990.

Reviewing Safety at the Hajj
Worldwide, human stampedes are so common—and so confounding—that they’ve inspired their own body of academic research within the larger field of study on crowd behavior. According to one 2010 study led by Edbert Hsu of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, 215 human stampedes took place worldwide between 1980 and 2007, leading to more than 7,000 deaths and 14,000 injuries. Stampedes have been evaluated as a public health issue , and as a sociological phenomenon . Others have asked whether the right algorithm could help identify dangerous crowd surges before they turn deadly.
Large religious gatherings are a particular stampede danger in the developing world. A 2013 paper out of India, for example, found that 79 percent of stampedes in that country have taken place at religious events, as opposed to political or entertainment-related events. In 2014, 178 people were killed in various Indian stampedes, and the country’s annual total death toll from stampedes has topped 300 four times in the past decade. According to Hsu’s research, the deadliest stampedes are concentrated in Southeast Asia and in Africa, and at religious events. But they can and do occur anywhere, as evidenced by the notorious New York stampede at a 2008 Wal-Mart Black Friday sale, which killed a store employee. With a growing global population concentrated in crowded cities, Hsu and his team found in 2010 that stampede incidents were on the rise.
Stampedes are captivating in part because, though somewhat common, they are also unpredictable. Here’s how John Seabrook described them in a harrowing 2011 article in The New Yorker:
The transition from fraternal smooshing to suffocating pressure—a “crowd crush”—often occurs almost imperceptibly; one doesn’t realize what’s happening until it’s too late to escape. Something interrupts the flow of pedestrians—a blocked exit, say, while an escalator continues to feed people into a closed-off space. ... At a certain point, you feel pressure on all sides of your body, and realize that you can’t raise your arms. You are pulled off your feet, and welded into a block of people. The crowd force squeezes the air out of your lungs, and you struggle to take another breath.
For remote observers, the terror of the phenomenon is compounded by the fact that it’s so hard to know whom to blame. In Saudi Arabia, the country’s health minister chalked up the latest incident to a failure to follow instructions, and the head of the Central Hajj Committee blamed “some pilgrims from African nationalities.” But others pointed to the Saudi government’s failure to manage the event. (It doesn’t help the Saudis’ claims of competence that a crane collapse at Mecca’s Grand Mosque killed 109 people just a few weeks ago.)
Crowds often take the blame for what are actually failures of planning and logistics.
The current discussion echoes what Seabrook concluded: Crowds often take the blame for what are actually failures of planning and logistics. Press accounts, he found, often characterize stampedes as “panics,” with a frenzied mob surging forward with no regard to whom they trample. But one recent analysis of crowd disasters, which focused on 2010 stampede that killed 21 people at the Love Parade music festival in Germany, found that the disaster had more to do with physics than psychology: “Video recordings show that people stumbled and piled up due to a ‘domino effect’, resulting from a phenomenon called ‘crowd turbulence’ or ‘crowd quake.’ This was the consequence of amplifying feedback and cascading effects, which are typical for systemic instabilities.”
Blocked exits, overcrowded spaces, and insufficient security and emergency services all exacerbate the dangers. Event organizers, managers, governments, promoters, designers, and other entities defend themselves vigorously in the aftermath of these disasters. But the crowd, so brutally cooperative in one moment, rarely speaks in such unison afterward. With no one to defend it, the crowd can be personified as violent or dumb.
And although it’s easy to assume that stampedes are caused by panicked crowds running away from something in fear, Seabrook found that, in general, that’s only true in fires. In most stampedes, the crowd is churning toward something. In the United States and Europe, stampedes are rarer than they are in the developing world, and they don’t tend to happen on religious occasions. Americans and Europeans stampede for other causes: Black Friday sales , rock concerts , and sporting events . No one person decides to stampede. But if there’s a connection between what attracts a crowd and what a society holds dear, then stampedes are a deadly illustration of those values.

Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life
Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life (1993) is a short comic film for BBC Scotland. Written and directed  by Peter Capaldi, it stars Richard E. Grant as Franz Kafka and co-stars Ken Stott.

The title refers to the name of the writer Franz Kafka and the film It's a Wonderful Life, directed by Frank Capra, and the plot takes the concept of the two to absurd depths. The great writer is about to write his famous work, The Metamorphosis, but inspiration is lacking, and he suffers continual interruptions.

The film features a rendition of ""Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life"" from the operetta Naughty Marietta.

In 1994, the short won a BAFTA Award for Best Short Film. The following year it tied for an Academy Award for Live Action Short Film with Trevor.

Passage:
Taurotragus
Taurotragus is a genus of large antelopes of the African savanna, commonly known as elands. It contains two species: the common eland T. oryx and the giant eland T. derbianus.

Taxonomy

Taurotragus is a genus of large African antelopes, placed under the subfamily Bovinae and family Bovidae. The genus authority is the German zoologist Johann Andreas Wagner, who first mentioned it in the journal Die Säugthiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur, mit Beschreibungen in 1855. The name is composed of two Greek words: Taurus or Tauros, meaning a bull or bullock;   and Tragos, meaning a male goat, in reference to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland's ear which resembles a goat's beard. 

The genus consists of two species:
* Common eland (Taurotragus oryx) (Pallas, 1766) : Three subspecies of common eland are recognized, though their validity has been in dispute.
* T. o. livingstonii (Sclater, 1864) (Livingstone's eland): Found in the Central Zambezian miombo woodlands. It has a brown pelt with up to 12 stripes.
* T. o. oryx (Pallas, 1766) (Cape eland): Found in south and southwest Africa. The coat is tawny, and adults lose their stripes.
* T. o. pattersonianus (Lydekker, 1906) (East African eland or Patterson's eland): Found in east Africa. Its coat can have up to 12 stripes.

* Giant eland (Taurotragus derbianus) (Gray, 1847) : The largest antelope in the world. It has two subspecies:
* T. d. derbianus J. E. Gray, 1847 – western giant eland, found in western Africa, particularly Senegal to Mali. Its coat is rufous, and can have up to 15 stripes.
* T. d. gigas Heuglin, 1863 – eastern giant eland, found in central to eastern Africa, particularly Cameroon to South Sudan. Its coat is sandy, and can have up to 12 stripes.

Taurotragus is sometimes considered part of the genus Tragelaphus on the basis of molecular phylogenetics. Together with the bongo, giant eland and common eland are the only antelopes in the tribe Tragelaphini (consisting of Taurotragus and Tragelaphus) to be given a generic name other than Tragelaphus. Although some authors, like Theodor Haltenorth, regarded the giant eland as conspecific with the common eland, they are generally considered two distinct species. 

Genetics and evolution

The eland have 31 male chromosomes and 32 female chromosomes. In a 2008 phylogenomic study of spiral-horned antelopes, chromosomal similarities were observed between cattle (Bos taurus) and eight species of spiral-horned antelopes, namely: nyala (Tragelaphus angasii), lesser kudu (T. imberbis), bongo (T. eurycerus), bushbuck (T. scriptus), greater kudu (T. strepsiceros), sitatunga (T. spekei), giant eland and common eland. It was found that chromosomes involved in centric fusions in these species used a complete set of cattle painting probes generated by laser microdissection. The study confirmed the presence of the chromosome translocation known as Robertsonian translocation (1;29), a widespread evolutionary marker common to all known tragelaphid species. 

An accidental mating between a male giant eland and a female kudu produced a male offspring, but it was azoospermic. Analysis showed that it completely lacked germ cells, which produce gametes. Still, the hybrid had a strong male scent and exhibited male behaviour. Chromosomal examination showed that chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 9, and 11 differed from the parental karyotypes. Notable mixed inherited traits were pointed ears as the eland's, but a bit widened like kudu's. The tail was half the length of that of an eland, with a terminal tuft of hair as in kudu. Female elands can also act as surrogates for bongos.

The bovid ancestors of the eland evolved approximately 20 million years ago in Africa; fossils are found throughout Africa and France but the best record appears in sub-Saharan Africa. The first members of the tribe Tragelaphini appear 6 million years in the past during the late Miocene. An extinct ancestor of the common eland (Taurotragus arkelli) appears in the Pleistocene in northern Tanzania and the first T. oryx fossil appears in the Holocene in Algeria. Previous genetic studies of African savanna ungulates revealed the presence of a long-standing Pleistocene refugium in eastern and southern Africa, which also includes the giant eland. The common eland and giant eland have been estimated to have diverged about 1.6 million years ago. 

Differences between species

Both the species of eland are large spiral-horned antelopes. Though the giant eland broadly overlaps in size with the common eland, the former is somewhat larger on average than the latter. In fact, the giant eland is the largest species of antelope in the world.  Eland are sexually dimorphic, as the females are smaller than males. The two eland species are nearly similar in height, ranging from . In both species, males typically weigh 400 to while females weigh 300 to. 

The coat of the common eland is tan for females, and darker with a bluish tinge for males. The giant eland is reddish-brown to chestnut. The coat of the common eland varies geographically; the eland in southern Africa lack the distinctive markings (torso stripes, markings on legs, dark garters and a spinal crest) present in those from the northern half of the continent. Similarly, the giant eland displays 8 to 12 well-defined vertical white torso stripes. In both species the coat of the males darken with age. According to zoologist Jakob Bro-Jørgensen, the colour of the male's coat can reflect the levels of androgen, a male hormone, which is highest during rutting.

Lulworth Cove
Lulworth Cove is a cove near the village of West Lulworth, on the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site in Dorset, southern England.  The cove is one of the world's finest examples of such a landform, and is a tourist location with approximately 500,000 visitors a year, of whom about 30% visit in July and August.   It is close to the rock arch of Durdle Door and other Jurassic Coast sites.

Lulworth Cove featured on the TV programme Seven Natural Wonders as one of the wonders of southern England.

Lulworth Cove 

The cove has formed because there are bands of rock of alternating resistance running parallel to the shore (a concordant coastline).  On the seaward side the clays and sands have been eroded away.  A narrow (less than 30 metre) band of Portland limestone rocks forms the shoreline.  Behind this is a narrow (less than 50 metres) band of slightly less resistant Purbeck limestone.  Behind this are 300–350 metres of much less resistant clays and greensands (Wealden clays, Gault and Upper Greensand).

Forming the back of the cove is a 250 metre wide band of chalk, which is considerably more resistant than the clays and sands, but less resistant than the limestones.  The entrance to the cove is a narrow gap in the limestone bands.  This was formed by a combination of erosional processes from wave action and weathering.  The wide part of the cove is where the weak clays and greensands have been eroded. At the back of the cove, the sea has been unable to erode the chalk as fast because chalk does not dissolve in the sea acids.

The unique shape of the cove is a result of wave diffraction. The narrow entrance to the cove ensures that as waves enter they bend into an arced shape this is shown clearly on the photograph.

Stair Hole 

Stair Hole, less than half a mile away, is an infant cove which suggests what Lulworth Cove would have looked like a few hundred thousand years ago.  The sea has made a gap in the Portland and Purbeck limestone here, as well as a small arch.  The sea has made its way through to the Wealdon clays and begun eroding them.  The clay shows obvious signs of slumping, and is eroding very rapidly.  Stair Hole shows one of the best examples of limestone folding (the Lulworth crumple) in the world, caused by movements in the Earth's crust (tectonics) millions of years ago. Folding can also be seen at nearby Durdle Door and at Lulworth cove itself.

Conservation, tourism, education and management 

Lulworth acts as a gateway to this part of the Jurassic Coast.  As well as the cove, across Hambury Tout (the large chalk hill to the west) is Durdle Door, a natural arch.  To the east there is a fossilised forest.  Lulworth is also close to Kimmeridge, famous for its rocky shore and fossils.  The sea floor in and around the cove yields fossils, and oil sands beneath the sea bed form the largest British oil field outside the North Sea area, and contain the highest quality oil in Europe.  Geologists and geographers have been interested in the area since the beginning of the 19th century, and in the 1830s the first serious study of the area took place. Since then the area has drawn Geology students from all over the world.

Purbeck suffers from trampling because of its many visitors and erosion from the sea. Management has been put in place to stop the coastline from being ruined, such as wooden steps and fences. These will keep people to a certain path and steps will reinforce the ground.

In 2001 the coast was granted World Heritage Site status by UNESCO. Experts at UNESCO have been working on preserving the shape of Lulworth Cove.  Lulworth was one of a number of gateway villages on the coast with a Heritage Centre—part visitor centre, tourist information and natural history museum—which in 2002 received 418,595 visitors.  Most of the area is privately owned by the Lulworth Estate, an estate held by the wealthy landowning family; The Welds.

Land to the east is owned by the Ministry of Defence and used for tank training, only open on weekends and holidays.  The coast and land to the north and around the village is owned and managed by the Lulworth Estate (see Lulworth Castle). Each year, over 250,000 people walk across the hill linking the cove to Durdle Door.

In popular culture

Lulworth Cove featured on the TV programme Seven Natural Wonders (2005) as one of the wonders of Southern England. It also appeared in the Mike Leigh TV film Nuts in May (1976), and was used for the location filming in the Doctor Who serial The Curse of Fenric (1989) and in the  film adaptation of the book World War Z (2013). Thomas Hardy also wrote a poem mentioning the location titled ""At Lulworth Cove a Century Back.""

Leopold Bloom is the fictional protagonist and hero of James Joyce's Ulysses. The character was inspired by Joyce's close friend Aron Ettore Schmitz (Italo Svevo), author of Zeno's Conscience. Bendorf Focus is an association of traders, the aim of which is to improve the local economy. The Rhine port of BendorF dates from 1900, handling clay and basalt it has the largest oil-storage facilities between Mainz and Cologne. In Literature Heinrich Böll's short story Wanderer, kommst du nach Spa... is set in Bendor f. The town consists of the following districts:                *BendorF                *Sayn                *Mülhofen                *Stromberg                *Vierwindenhöhe                *Wanderer kommst du nach  Spa... (Wandering The Wanderer of the Spa...) (W Wanderer is a short story about a man who travels to the spa town of Spa, in the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg). The town is home to many retail stores, including a large number of clothing stores and a number of fashion boutiques. The former industrial city was dominated by mining and the metallurgical industry from the 18th century to the early 20th century. The most imposing relic of this era is the Sayner Hütte (Sayn mine works). The ores of the Bendorfer mine works came from the Trierischer Loh iron-ore mine. In the book's latter episodes, Bloom goes out of his way to rescue Stephen Dedalus from a brothel, rescuing him back to his own house and even offering him a place to study there. The reader becomes familiar with Bloom's tolerant, humanistic outlook, his penchant for voyeurism and his infidelity. Bloom detests violence and violence, and his relative indifference to Irish nationalism leads to disputes with some of his peers.

A whorl is an arrangement of sepals, petals, leaves, stipules or branches that radiate from a single point and surround or wrap around the stem. A flower lacking any of these floral structures is said to be incomplete or imperfect. The name Helvetia is a derivation of the ethnonym Helvetii, the name of the Gaulish tribe inhabiting the Swiss Plateau to the Roman conquest. The allegory is typically pictured in a flowing gown, with a spear and a shield emblazoned with the Swiss flag, and commonly with braided hair, commonly with a wreath as a symbol of confederation. This replaces an earlier convention, popular in the 1580s, of representing Switzerland as a bull (Schweizer Stier). In the 17th century, there isn't a single allegory identified as Helvetica. Rather, a number of allegories are shown representing both virtues and vederacy of the confederacy. The title page of the 1642 Topographia, Matthäus Meräus, shows two figures seated in two allegory figures: one is the figuus, the other is the goddess Helveia.

Female allegories of individual cantons predate the single Helvetia figure. There are depictions of a Respublica Tigurina Virgo (1607), a Lucerna shown in 1658 with the victor of Villmergen, Christoph Pfyffer, and a Berna of 1682. In 1672, a monumental baroque play by Johann Caspar Weissenbach was performed in Zug, entitled Eydtgnossisch Contrafeth Auff- und Abnemmender Jungfrawen Helvetiae. In the final scene, Christ himself appears to punish the wayward damsel, but the Mother of God and Bruder Klaus intercede and the contrite sinner is pardoned.Identification of the Swiss as ""Helvetians"" (Hélvetiens) becomes common in the 18th century, particularly in the French language. She appears on official federal coins and stamps from the foundation of Switzerland as a federal state in 1848. The Swiss Confederation continues to use the name in its Latin form when it is inappropriate or inconvenient to use any or all of its four official languages. The full name, Confœderatio Helvetica, is abbreviated for uses such as the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and vehicle registration code CH, and the ccTLD,.ch. The German-speaking Swiss use simply ""H Velvetia"" or ""Helvecia"" as poetic synonym of their country. In French, Swiss people may be referred to as Helvètes. In German, Helvetien is used as a synonyms of Schweiz and has a higher poetic value. In Italian, the demonym noun/adjective elvetico is used commonly assynonym of svizzero. In Greek, the word Elveţia is seen as archaic, but it is also used as synonym for ""Swiss"" in some dialects of the language, such as Irish and Romanian. In English, the term ""Switzerland"" is used to refer to the Swiss Confederation as a whole, rather than just the canton of Basel or the city of Geneva, as in the case of the cantons of Ticino, Geneva, Lucerne and Zug. The word Helvetie is used in the name of the town of Lausanne, in Switzerland's cantons, as well as in other parts of the world such as France, Germany, Italy and the UK. Tendring District Council is based in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. The district was formed on 1 April 1974 as a merger of the borough of Harwich, with Brightlingsea, Clactson and Frinton and Walton urban districts, and Tendring Rural District. The name Tendring comes from the ancient Tendring Hundred which is named after the small Tendring village at the centre of the area. The Conservatives are the largest party with 23 out of the 60 available seats. Tendring returns eight County Councillors to Essex County Council and at the 2013 local elections 4 seats were held by Conservatives, 2 won by UKIP, 1 won by Labour and one won by a Tendring First independent. In 2014 the Council was described as ""moronic"" and ""cretinous"" after it destroyed a mural by Banksy on a toilet block. The highest part of the district is a low (35 metres) ridge running west to east only 3 km south of the River Stour. It is undulating land sloping very gently to the south which is traversed by a number of streams. In the extreme east is an area formerly known as Thorpe-Soken which was granted special privileges in Saxon times which is remembered in the place names Soken, Thorpe and Thorpe. The area contains the most deprived area in England and Wales,  and is currently held by two UKIP Councillor. The council is currently in a state of No Overall Control (NOC) after the Local Elections in 2015. It has 33 out of 60 seats, holding 33 of the 33 available seats, and is controlled by the Conservatives who gained control of the authority in the 2011 local elections. It also has 22 seats held by the UK Independence Party with 22 seats, the Labour Party with 4 seats,. the Liberal Democrats with 1 seat, and 6 independents were also elected.  The district is divided into the following parishes. ""From"" indicates older parishes which have now been merged, and ""from"" indicates parishes that have been merged. The largest town in the Tendring district is Clact on the Sea, with a population of 53,000. Large villages in the district include St Osyth and Great Bentley. The town of Manningtree and village of Mistley are in the north-east of Tendring. During the English civil war, the witch-finder general, Matthew Hopkins carried out many trials throughout this and the surrounding area especially in the town of Maningtree and Manningtree. On Thursday, more than 700 people were killed in a stampede outside the holy city of Mecca. The disaster took place during the annual Hajj pilgrimage, which draws about 2 million Muslims to Saudi Arabia each year. According to one 2010 study, 215 human stampedes took place worldwide between 1980 and 2007. The deadliest stampedes are concentrated in Southeast Asia and in Africa, and at religious events, the study found. But stampedes can and do occur anywhere, as evidenced by the notorious New York stampede at a 2008 Wal-Mart Black Friday sale, which killed a store employee. The terror of the phenomenon is compounded by the fact that it’s so hard to know whom to blame, says John Seabrook.. A 2013 paper out of India, for example, found that 79 percent of stampedes in that country have taken place at religious event, as opposed to political or entertainment-related events. In 2014, 178 people were. killed in various Indian stampedes, and the country’S annual total death toll from stampedes has topped 300. four times in the past decade. The current discussion echoes what Seabraok concluded: Crowds often take the blame for what are actually failures of planning and logistics, he says. But one recent analysis of crowd disasters, which focused on 2010 stampede that killed 21 people at the Love Parade music festival in Germany, found the disaster had more to do with physics. “Video recordings show that people stumbled and piled up due to a ‘domino effect,’ ” Seabrrook says, “and it was more psychology to the effect than psychology.’“Stampedes are captivating in part because, though somewhat common, they are also unpredictable. One doesn’t realize what’�s happening until it is too late to escape,” he says, adding that it is difficult to know who is to blame for the latest incident in Saudi Arabia. ‘You are pulled off your feet, and welded into a block of people. The crowd force squeezes the air out of your lungs, and you struggle to take another breath.” In most stampedes, the crowd is churning toward something. In the United States and Europe, stampedes are rarer than they are in the developing world. Americans and Europeans stampede for other causes: Black Friday sales, rock concerts, and sporting events. If there’s a connection between what attracts a crowd and what a society holds dear, then stampes are a deadly illustration of those values. It's a Wonderful Life (1993) is a short comic film for BBC Scotland. Written and directed by Peter Capaldi, it stars Richard E. Grant as Franz Kafka and co-stars Ken Stott as Woland the Knifeman. In 1994, the short won a BAFTA Award for Best Short Film. The following year it tied for an Academy Award for Live Action Short Film with Trevor   Trevor    The film features a rendition of ""Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life"" from the operetta Naughty Marietta. It has two species: the common eland T. oryx and the giant eland  T. derbianus. The largest antelope in the world has two sub-species: The largest is tawny, and adults lose their stripes. Its coat can have up to 12 stripes and can have a brown pelt with up to a dozen stripes. It is the only species of African antelopes that has been named by a living person. The genus authority is the German zoologist Johann Andreas Wagner, who first mentioned it in the journal Die Säugthiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur, mit Beschreibungen in 1855. The name is composed of two Greek words: Taurus or Tauros, meaning a bull or bullock;  and Tragos,meaning a male goat, in reference to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland's ear which resembles a goat's beard. It can be found in the Central Zambezian woodlands, in the south and southwest of South Africa, and in the east of the African savanna, in Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa. It was first described in 1766 by the zoologist Johann Andreas Wagner in his book ""The Zoology of the Elands"" (Pallas, 1766) The genus consists of three species: Common eland (Taurotragus oryx), T. otersonian patus (East African eland or Patterson), and T. livingstonii (Livingstone, 1864) Giant eland and common eland are the only antelopes in the tribe Tragelaphini to be given a generic name. The giant eland is the largest species of antelope in the world. Eland are sexually dimorphic, as the females are smaller than males. The two eland species are nearly similar in height, ranging from. In both species, males typically weigh 400 to while females weigh 300 to. The eland have 31 male chromosomes and 32 female chromosomes. The bovid ancestors of the eland evolved approximately 20 million years ago in Africa; fossils are found throughout Africa and France but the best record appears in sub-Saharan Africa. An accidental mating between a male giant elands and a female kudu produced a male offspring, but it was azoospermic. The tail was half the length of that of an eland, with a terminal tuft of hair as in kudo. Female elands can also act as surrogates for bongos. An extinct ancestor of the common elands (Taurotragus arkelli) appears in northern Tanzania and the first T. oryx fossil appears in the Holocene in Algeria. It was found that chromosomes involved in centric fusions in these species used a complete set of cattle painting probes generated by laser microdissection. Previous genetic studies of African savanna ungulates revealed the presence of a long-standing Pleistocene refugium in eastern and southern Africa, which also includes the giant e Land. The common eLand and giant eLand have been estimated to have diverged about 1.6 million years old. The coat of thecommon eland varies from reddish-brown to chestnut. The coats of the giant Eland in southern Africa lack the distinctive (torso stripes, markings, garters and a spinal crest) present in half of those from the northern continent. Both species display 8 to 12-defined vertical white stripes on the torso. In the northern species the coat of males the darken with age to Jakob Bro-Jobensen, the col-Jørgensen, a zoologist to zoologist at the University of Jørgen in Norway. The species of eland can also be found in southern and western Africa, particularly Senegal to Mali, where the coat is rufous, and can have up to 15 stripes. Lulworth Cove is a cove near the village of West Lulworth, on the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site in Dorset, southern England. The cove has formed because there are bands of rock of alternating resistance running parallel to the shore. It is a tourist location with approximately 500,000 visitors a year, of whom about 30% visit in July and August. The sea floor in and around the cove yields fossils, and oil sands beneath the sea bed form the largest British oil field outside the North Sea area, and contain the highest quality oil in Europe. The unique shape of the cove is a result of wave diffraction. The narrow entrance to the cove ensures that as waves enter they bend into an arced shape this is shown clearly on the photograph. Experts at UNESCO have been working to preserve the shape of Lul Worth Cove since it was granted World Heritage World Site status by the UNESCO in 2001.ur of the male's coat can reflect the levels of androgen, a male hormone, which is highest during rutting. It can also be seen at nearby Durdle Door and at Lulworthy Cove itself. The area has drawn Geology students from all over the world and is a popular destination for tourists and geologists. It has been named one of the Seven Natural Wonders of southern England on the TV programme Seven Natural wonders of southernEngland. The UNESCO has been working since 2001 to preserving the shape and size of the coast with a number of tourist centres, a visitor centre, a natural history museum and a tourist information and information centre. The site is also close to Kimmeridge, famous for its rocky shore and fossils,  and is close to the rock arch of Durdre Door and other Jurassic Coast sites.  The sea has made its way through to the Wealdon clays and begun eroding them. The clay shows obvious signs of slumping, and is eroding very rapidly. At the back of the Cove, the sea has been unable to erode the chalk as fast because chalk does not dissolve in the sea acids. At Stair Hole, less than half a mile away, is an infant cove which suggests what Lulsworth Cove would have looked like a few hundred thousand years ago, as well as a small arch. In the 1830s the first serious study of the area took place.  Geologists and geographers have been interested in the area since the beginning of the 19th century, and in the 18th century. Most of the area is privately owned by the Lulworth Estate, an estate held by the wealthy landowning family; The Welds. Each year, over 250,000 people walk across the hill linking the cove to Durdle Door. The coast and land to the north and around the village is owned and managed by the Lulworth Estate. Land to the east is owned by the Ministry of Defence and used for tank training, only open on weekends and holidays. It was used for the location filming in the Doctor Who serial The Curse of Fenric (1989) and in the  film adaptation of the book World War Z (2013) Thomas Hardy also wrote a poem mentioning the location."

I COULD’VE SUNG ALL NIGHT
Remembering Marni Nixon, the Invisible Voice of ‘My Fair Lady,’ ‘West Side Story,’ and ‘The King and I’
Nixon, who died Sunday, dubbed the singing voices for Natalie Wood, Audrey Hepburn, and Deborah Kerr. Here’s why you never saw her face—and why you need to hear her story.
07.25.16 5:15 PM ET
We’ve all heard Marni Nixon’s voice. But only some of us have heard her story.
Even though you probably couldn’t pick her face out in a crowd, Marni Nixon might have been the most important performer in the Hollywood movie musical boom of the ’50s and ’60s—and certainly the most talented singer. 
Nixon, who died Sunday at age 86 , dubbed the singing voices for Deborah Kerr in The King and I, Natalie Wood in West Side Story , and Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady. Though the trio of legends brought Anna, Maria, and Eliza to the big screen, it was Nixon’s voice who brought them to life—and and into our hearts.  
It’s a story that would be fodder for its own Hollywood film…if it already wasn’t essentially the plot for Singin’ in the Rain. Just as studios started to rely on the star power of its greatest actresses to topline its movie musicals, Nixon, who had perfect pitch and a remarkable ability to sing any piece of music handed to her, was brought in to make their vocal performances more palatable. 
In a way, Marni Nixon was the original autotune. Not that she would ever need it—listen to her indelible versions of “I Could Have Danced All Night” or “Somewhere” for proof of that. One of her first big jobs was singing the high notes that Marilyn Monroe couldn’t reach for Gentleman Prefer Blondes, landing the assignment to dub Kerr’s voice in The King and I soon after. 
That Nixon did this was, of course, a secret. She received no screen credit for her work on those legendary films. She signed the scary contracts and kept mum in order to ensure that word never got out. Of course, it did eventually. TIME magazine caught wind of her work and unveiled her as the industry’s “ghostess with the mostest” in a 1964 article. 
Despite the fact that the movies she sang for became blockbuster hits and instant classics, with West Wide Story and My Fair Lady even earning Best Picture Oscars, Nixon was so anonymous that she even appeared as a contestant on a 1964 episode of To Tell the Truth , the game show in which the contestant is joined by two imposters and celebrity panelists attempt to discern who is the real deal. Two of the four panelists correctly identified Nixon; perhaps her lying skills weren’t as prolific as her singing voice. 
In a recent Washington Post article , Nixon graciously referred to her uncredited contributions as “just part of the working singer’s job in Hollywood,” saying that “you just worked any way you can.” 
She told WNYC in 2009 that “they thought of course that if you did some ghost work that probably you weren’t really appearing on stage and that meant something was probably wrong with you, like you were too fat or ugly or cross-eyed or something.” That To Tell the Truth clip from 1964 suggests that certainly is not true. She was just as beautiful as she was talented. She just didn’t boast the name recognition of an Audrey Hepburn or a Deborah Kerr.
Hilariously, Nixon spilled that often the actresses for which she was doing dubbing work didn’t know their voices were being dubbed until their films came out, or at least not to what extent. Wood and Hepburn, for example, were under the impression that only some of their singing would be replaced by Nixon—the high notes too lofty to hit—not the entire musical performance. 
“In the case of Audrey Hepburn, she was very smart and could say, ‘I know this is not good enough, I want to keep trying myself,’ but she had to accept that it wasn’t quite what it should be,” Nixon told The Washington Post . “But I don’t think that Natalie Wood’s ego could take that. Frankly, I think they used to create that kind of attitude too much—allowing them to have the illusion when they knew all along that she wasn’t good enough.”
She and Kerr had a wonderful working relationship, though. Kerr knew from the get-go that she would be dubbed, and worked side by side with Nixon to make sure that her acting performance matched Nixon’s vocal one. In an article titled “Deborah Kerr Tells Secret,” the actress even happily divulged that it was Nixon who did the singing.
When Nixon told her after the interview was published that people weren’t supposed to know, Nixon recalls that Kerr winkingly told her, “I don’t have to know that’s in your contract.” Recalling the memory, Nixon said about Kerr, “She was that gracious. She was wonderful.” 
In the end, the fact that these movie musicals featured dubbed singing didn’t harm their legacies at all. Though, as NPR’s Linda Holmes noted Monday on Twitter , it says a lot about the industry and our culture that “Hollywood thought a young Puerto Rican, a poor English girl, and a prim schoolteacher should all sound like the same person.”

Gandhi cap
The Gandhi cap () is a white coloured sidecap, pointed in front and back and having a wide band. It is made out of khadi. It takes its name after the Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi, who first popularised its use during the Indian independence movement. Worn commonly by Indian independence activists, it became a symbolic tradition for politicians and political activists to wear it in independent India.

Genesis

The Gandhi cap emerged in India during the First Non-cooperation movement during 1918-1921.  when it became the standard Congress dress as popularized by Gandhi. In 1921, the British government tried to ban the use of the Gandhi cap. 
Gandhi himself wore the cap only for 1–2 years during 1920-21.  

Gandhi's homespun khadi attire of traditional Indian clothes were symbolic of his message of cultural pride, the use of Swadeshi goods (as opposed to those manufactured in Europe), self-reliance and solidarity with India's rural masses. The cap became common to most followers of Gandhi and members of the Indian National Congress. A connection to the independence movement was implied when any individual wore the cap in those times.

Prisoners in South African prisons classified as ""negroes"" (a category into which Indians fell while Gandhi was in South Africa) also were required to wear similar caps in prison during 1907 to 1914. Gandhi's close friend Henry Polak cites Gandhi's time in South African jail, where he was classified as a ""negro"" and thus required to wear such a cap, as the genesis of the Gandhi Cap. 
 However Gandhi, in a letter to Kaka Kalelkar, described in detail how he based his white cap on the Kashmiri cap. 

After independence

The first generation of post-independence Indian politicians were almost universally members of the freedom struggle. Gandhi's death in 1948 gave an emotional importance to the Gandhi cap, which was regularly worn by Indian leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister. Succeeding prime minister such as Lal Bahadur Shastri and Morarji Desai would continue the tradition. Most members of the Indian Parliament (especially politicians and activists of the Congress party) wore khadi clothing and the Gandhi cap. Large numbers of people donned the cap when celebrating India's independence on August 15 or the promulgation of a republic on January 26.

Jawarharlal Nehru was always remembered as having worn the cap. In 1964 a coin showing Nehru in profile was released which was widely criticized for lacking the cap. Another Nehru coin was later released in 1989 on his birth centenary, which showed him wearing a cap.

In later times, the cap had lost its popular and political appeal. Although many members of the Congress party continued the tradition, rival political parties preferred to dissociate themselves from the tradition linked with the Congress. The mass acceptance of Western-style clothing had also diminished the importance of wearing Indian-style clothes for politicians.

The cap remains the most popular everyday headgear worn by men in rural parts of Maharashtra. 

In the ""I Have a Dream"" speech of Martin Luther King, Jr in 1963, one can see people standing behind him on stage wearing Gandhi caps. 

Re-emergence of the Gandhi cap

In 2011, the Gandhi cap once again rose in popularity in India after Anna Hazare, an eminent Gandhian from Maharashtra, started an anti-corruption movement in India. The epicenter of this movement was in Delhi. In August 2011, thousands of people wearing Gandhi caps accumulated at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi to support Anna Hazare on his fast-unto-death. This movement spilled over to many other parts of the country and stadiums, community centers and grounds were booked for assimilation of a similar nature. The mass movement witnessed people of all age groups, religions and social standings (mainly the Middle Class) as participants, many among them shouting slogans and wearing Gandhi caps.

In the 2014 election, the workers of Aam Aadmi Party widely wore the Gandhi cap with text printed on it.  BJP supporters wore a similar saffron colored cap.
Question:
What item of clothing, known as a 'topi', was popularised by Indian leaders Mahatma Gandhi, Jaraharlal Nehru, and later by anti-corruption campaigner Anna Hazare?

Cap

Partridge met Wexler in 1984, shortly after she had split from artist Roy Lichtenstein. 

In the 1984 Channel 4 documentary Partridge revealed that he was a keen designer of board games.  He has stated on his website that he is an atheist.

Influence

Partridge has been cited as an influence by John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers in a 2002 issue of Total Guitar magazine, as well as being cited as an influence on the sound of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' album By the Way. 

Singer and multi-instrumentalist Steven Wilson named Partridge one of his favourite songwriters of all time: ""What I love about Andy's music is that every song he writes has a very strong concept or idea behind it. He's not just rattling off love songs or songs about how lonely he is. Every song has a little twist to it, and it's so clever, so smart.""   His favourite XTC albums are Drums and Wires and Black Sea.

Partridge mixed recordings for the band Captains of Industry. In 2007 he collaborated with former XTC bandmate Barry Andrews on the Shriekback album Glory Bumps. In 2008, Partridge began working on an album with Robyn Hitchcock and Mike Keneally, and various solo projects.

Levinson's first writing work was for variety shows such as The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine, The Lohman and Barkley Show, The Tim Conway Show, and The Carol Burnett Show. After some success as a screenwriter – notably the Mel Brooks comedies Silent Movie (1976) and High Anxiety (1977) (in which he played a bellboy) and the Oscar-nominated script (co-written by then-wife Valerie Curtin) ...And Justice for All (1979) – Levinson began his career as a director with Diner (1982), for which he had also written the script and which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay.

Diner was the first of a series of films set in the Baltimore of Levinson's youth. The others were Tin Men (1987), a story of aluminum-siding salesmen in the 1960s starring Richard Dreyfuss and Danny DeVito; the immigrant family saga Avalon (which featured Elijah Wood in one of his earliest screen appearances), and Liberty Heights (1999).

His biggest hit, both critically and financially, was Rain Man (1988), a sibling drama starring Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise (Levinson appeared in a cameo as a doctor). The film won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. It also won the Golden Bear at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival. 

Another of his notable films is the popular period baseball drama The Natural (1984), starring Robert Redford. Redford would later direct Quiz Show (1994) and cast Levinson as television personality Dave Garroway. Levinson also directed the classic war comedy Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), starring Robin Williams, with whom he later collaborated on the fantasy Toys (1992) and the political comedy Man of the Year (2006). Levinson also directed the critically acclaimed historical crime drama Bugsy (1991), which starred Warren Beatty and was nominated for ten Academy Awards.

He directed Dustin Hoffman again in Wag the Dog (1997), a political comedy co-starring Robert De Niro about a war staged in a film studio (Levinson had been an uncredited co-writer on Hoffman's 1982 hit comedy Tootsie). The film won the Silver Bear – Special Jury Prize at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival. 

Levinson partnered with producer Mark Johnson to form the film production company Baltimore Pictures. The two parted ways in 1994. Levinson has been a producer or executive producer for such major productions as The Perfect Storm (2000), directed by Wolfgang Petersen; Analyze That (2002), starring De Niro as a neurotic mob boss and Billy Crystal as his therapist, and Possession (2002), based on the best-selling novel by A. S. Byatt.

He has a television production company with Tom Fontana (The Levinson/Fontana Company) and served as executive producer for a number of series, including Homicide: Life on the Street (which ran on NBC from 1993 to 1999) and the HBO prison drama Oz. Levinson also played an uncredited main role as a judge in the short-lived TV series The Jury.

Levinson published his first novel, Sixty-Six (ISBN 0-7679-1533-X), in 2003. Like several of his films, it is semi-autobiographical and set in Baltimore in the 1960s. He directed two webisodes of the American Express ads ""The Adventures of Seinfeld and Superman"". In 2004, Levinson was the recipient of the Austin Film Festival's Distinguished Screenwriter Award. Levinson directed a documentary PoliWood about the 2008 Democratic and Republican National Conventions. The documentary, produced by Tim Daly, Robin Bronk and Robert E. Baruc, had its premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival.

Levinson is in production on a film based on Whitey Bulger, the Boston crime boss.  The film Black Mass (script by Jim Sheridan, Jez Butterworth, and Russell Gewirtz) is based on the book by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, and is said to be the ""true story of Billy Bulger, Whitey Bulger, FBI agent John Connelly and the FBI's witness protection program that was created by J. Edgar Hoover."" 

In September 2013, Levinson was set to direct the film titled Rock the Kasbah, written by Mitch Glazer. Bruce Willis, Shia LaBeouf, Bill Murray and Kate Hudson will star in the film. He has also finished production on The Humbling (2015), starring Al Pacino.

In 2010 Levinson received the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement, which is the lifetime achievement award from the Writers Guild of America.

Passage:
Monorchism
Monorchism (also monorchidism) is the state of having only one testicle within the scrotum.

Causes

This can be due to:
* One testicle not descending into the scrotum during normal embryonic or fetal development (3–4% of 'normal' live births), also known as undescended testis or cryptorchidism. In this case the testis is within the abdominal cavity, somewhere along the normal route of descent – most commonly, within the inguinal canal. Such a testis has an increased risk of malignancy.
* One testicle may disappear during development (the so-called vanishing testis) due to some intrauterine insult. This is thought to be most likely vascular, such as testicular torsion.
* One testicle may have been surgically removed through orchiectomy.
* One testicle may be injured.

Notable cases

Due to testicular cancer

* Lance Armstrong, American bicyclist. 
* Frank Church, late U.S. Senator and a presidential aspirant in 1976. His monorchism was revealed publicly during the 1976 presidential campaign. 
* Tom Green, Canadian comedian-actor. 
* Mark Latham, former Australian politician. 
* Geoff Horsfield, English footballer. 
* Nenê, Brazilian basketball player. 
* Kevin Curtis, American football player. 
* Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party.
* Bobby Moore, English footballer and World Cup winner. 

Due to injury

* Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas, magnate of the Kingdom of Scotland, and Peer of France. Lost in 1403, while fighting at the Battle of Shrewsbury (He had previous year, lost an eye at the Battle of Homildon Hill). 
* Francisco Franco, dictator of Spain. 
* Troy Bayliss, world superbike champion in 2001, 2006 and 2008. In 2007 he lost a testicle during a race at Donington Park. 
* Brian Foster, American mixed martial artist. 

Due to cryptorchidism

* Bruce Lee, American-Chinese actor and martial arts instructor. 
* Mao Zedong, known as Chairman Mao, Chinese revolutionary. 

Monorchism in nonhuman animals

Although extremely rare, monorchism has been observed to be characteristic of some animal species, notably in beetles. 

Terminology

An individual having monorchism can be referred to as monorchid.
Question:
A monorchid has one what?
Answer:
Testical cyst

1973 Women's Cricket World Cup
The 1973 Women's Cricket World Cup was the first tournament of its kind, held two years before the first limited overs World Cup for men in 1975.  The competition was won by the hosts, England.   The competition was the brainchild of businessman Sir Jack Hayward, who contributed £40,000 towards its costs.

England, Australia, New Zealand, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica were joined by an International XI and a Young England side in a round robin league which saw the top team win the World Cup.  England topped the group with 20 points from their six matches, including five victories and one defeat, while Australia were runners up posting 17 points with four wins. 

The final round robin match, held at Edgbaston on 28 July, was distinguished by a commanding century by Enid Bakewell of England, whose 118 formed the bedrock of England's imposing 279-3 in their 60 overs, with captain Rachel Heyhoe-Flint scoring 64.  Australia were restricted by tight England bowling and fell well short of their target, scoring 187-9.  The cup was presented by Princess Anne and the winning England team were hosted at a reception at 10 Downing Street by Prime Minister Edward Heath [http://content.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/393261.html].  

Bakewell, one of England's finest all time players, was the leading run-scorer in the competition with 264 runs while Rosalind Heggs, of Young England, headed the bowling aggregates with 12 wickets.  The next World Cup was held five years later in 1978.

Passage:
North Pennines
The North Pennines is the northernmost section of the Pennine range of hills which runs north–south through northern England. It lies between Carlisle to the west and Darlington to the east. It is bounded to the north by the Tyne Valley and to the south by the Stainmore Gap.

Overview 

The North Pennines was designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in 1988 for its moorland scenery, the product of centuries of farming and lead-mining. At almost 2000 km2 it is the second largest of the 49 AONBs in the United Kingdom.

The landscape of the North Pennines AONB is one of open heather moors between deep dales, upland rivers, hay meadows and stone-built villages, some of which contain the legacies of a mining and industrial past. The area shares a boundary with the Yorkshire Dales National Park in the south and extends as far as the Tyne Valley, just south of Hadrian's Wall in the north.

In the North Pennines are: 40% of the UK's upland hay meadows; 30% of England's upland heathland and 27% of its blanket bog; 80% of England's black grouse; short-eared owl, ring ouzel, common snipe and common redshank; 36% of the AONB designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest; red squirrels, otters and rare arctic alpine plants; 22,000 pairs of breeding waders and one of England's biggest waterfalls – High Force.

One of the many walking routes in the North Pennines is Isaac's Tea Trail, a circular route of 58 km around the area, running from Ninebanks via Allendale, Nenthead and Alston.  In addition to this, a large section of the Pennine Way falls in the AONB, including one of the most celebrated stretches through Teesdale, a lush valley with dramatic river scenery including the twin attractions of High Force and Cauldron Snout.

The AONB is notable for rare flora and fauna, including wild alpine plants not found elsewhere in Britain. It is also home to red squirrels and diverse birds of prey. The impressive landscape of the North Pennines – from High Force on the River Tees to the sweeping valley of High Cup Gill above Dufton – are the product of millions of years of geological processes. The worldwide significance of the geology found in the area was recognised in 2003 when the AONB became Britain's first European Geopark. A year later the area become one of the founding members of the UNESCO-assisted Global Geopark family. Geoparks are areas with outstanding geological heritage where this is being used to support sustainable development.

Another of the North Pennines' oddities is that it is home to England's only named wind, the Helm Wind. It has caught out many walkers traversing the plateaux around Cross Fell, the Eden Valley fellside, and the valleys between Alston and Dufton.

The great English poet W. H. Auden spent much time in this area and some forty poems and two plays are set here. Auden visited the area in 1919 and ""five years later was writing poems about Alston Moor and Allendale.""  He referred to the region as his ""Mutterland"", his ""great good place"", and equated it with his idea of Eden. Scores of Pennine place-names are found in his work, including Cauldron Snout and Rookhope.

Passage:
List of Presidents of the United States
Under the United States Constitution, the President of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States. As chief of the executive branch and face of the federal government as a whole, the presidency is the highest political office in the United States by influence and recognition. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The president is indirectly elected to a four-year term by an Electoral College (or by the House of Representatives, should the Electoral College fail to award an absolute majority of votes to any person). Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.  Upon the death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent president, the vice president assumes the office. The president must be at least 35 years of age, has to have lived in the United States for 14 years, and has to be a ""natural born"" citizen of the United States.

This list includes only those persons who were sworn into office as president following the ratification of the United States Constitution, which took effect on March 4, 1789. For American leaders before this ratification, see President of the Continental Congress.  The list does not include any acting presidents under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

There have been 43 people sworn into office, and 44 presidencies, as Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is counted chronologically as both the 22nd and 24th president. Of the individuals elected as president, four died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison,  Zachary Taylor,  Warren G. Harding,  and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln,  James A. Garfield,  William McKinley,  and John F. Kennedy) and one resigned (Richard Nixon). 

George Washington, the first president, was inaugurated in 1789 after a unanimous vote of the Electoral College. William Henry Harrison spent the shortest time in office with 32 days in 1841. Franklin D. Roosevelt spent the longest with over twelve years, but died shortly into his fourth term in 1945; he is the only president to have served more than two terms.  A constitutional amendment, affecting presidents after Harry Truman, was passed to limit the number of times an individual can be elected president. Andrew Jackson, the seventh president, was the first to be elected by white men of all classes in 1828 after most laws barring non-land-owners from voting were repealed. Warren Harding was the first elected after women gained voting rights in 1920. Four presidents—John Q. Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, Benjamin Harrison, and George W. Bush—lost the popular vote but assumed office; Bush was subsequently re-elected with a popular majority. John F. Kennedy has been the only president of Roman Catholic faith, and the current president, Barack Obama, is the first president of African descent.

Passage:
Vesti la giubba
"""" (""Put on the costume"", sometimes translated as ""On With the Motley"") is a famous tenor aria from Ruggero Leoncavallo's 1892 opera Pagliacci. """" is sung at the conclusion of the first act, when Canio discovers his wife's infidelity, but must nevertheless prepare for his performance as Pagliaccio the clown because ""the show must go on"".

The aria is often regarded as one of the most moving in the operatic repertoire of the time. The pain of Canio is portrayed in the aria and exemplifies the entire notion of the ""tragic clown"": smiling on the outside but crying on the inside. This is still displayed today, as the clown motif often features the painted-on tear running down the cheek of the performer.

Enrico Caruso's recordings of the aria, from 1902, 1904 and 1909, were among the top selling records of the 78-rpm era..The New Guinness Book of Records, ed. Peter Matthews, Guinness Publishing. 1995. p.150 

This aria is often used in popular culture, and has been featured in many renditions, mentions, and spoofs.

Lyrics

Samples

The melody of the song was utilized by the rock band Queen in their 1984 single ""It's a Hard Life"" when frontman Freddie Mercury sang the song's opening lyrics ""I don't want my freedom, there's no reason for living with a broken heart.""

Passage:
Sheba
Sheba (; Ge'ez: ሳባ, Saba, , Sabaʾ, South Arabian , , Šəḇā) was a kingdom mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and the Quran. Sheba features in Ethiopian, Hebrew and Qur'anic traditions. Among other things it was the home of the biblical ""Queen of Sheba"" (named Makeda in Ethiopian tradition and Bilqīs in Arabic tradition).

The view that the biblical kingdom of Sheba was the ancient civilization of Saba in South Arabia is controversial. Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman write that ""the Sabaean kingdom began to flourish only from the eighth century BCE onward"" and that the story of Solomon and Sheba is ""an anachronistic seventh-century set piece meant to legitimize the participation of Judah in the lucrative Arabian trade."" The British Museum states that there is no archaeological evidence for such a queen but that the kingdom described as hers was Saba, ""the oldest and most important of the South Arabian kingdoms""   Kenneth Kitchen dates the kingdom to between 1200 BCE until 275 CE with its capital, Ma'rib.  The Kingdom fell after a long but sporadic civil war between several Yemenite dynasties claiming kingship,   resulting in the rise of the late Himyarite Kingdom.

Biblical tradition

The two names Sheba (spelled in Hebrew with shin) and Seba (spelled with samekh) are mentioned several times in the Bible with different genealogy. For instance, in the Generations of Noah  Seba, along with Dedan, is listed as a descendant of Noah's son Ham (as sons of Raamah, son of Cush). Later on in Genesis,  Sheba and Dedan are listed as names of sons of Jokshan, son of Abraham
Another Sheba is listed in the Table of Nations  as a son of Joktan. Another descendant of Noah's son Shem.

There are several possible reasons for this confusion.  One theory is that the Sabaean established many colonies to control the trade routes and the variety of their caravan stations confused the ancient Israelites, as their ethnology was based on geographical and political grounds and not necessarily racial.  Another theory suggests that the Sabaeans hailed from the southern Levant and established their kingdom on the ruins of the Minaeans.  It remains a theory however and cannot be confirmed.

The most famous claim to fame for the Biblical land of Sheba was the story  of the Queen of Sheba, who travelled to Jerusalem to question King Solomon, arriving in a large caravan with precious stones, spices and gold. The apocryphal Christian Arabic text Kitāb al-Magall (""Book of the Rolls"", Kitāb al-Magāll.  considered part of Clementine literature) and the Syriac Cave of Treasures mention a tradition that after being founded by the children of Saba (son of Joktan), there was a succession of sixty female rulers up until the time of Solomon.

The Jewish-Roman historian Josephus describes a place called Saba as a walled, royal city of Ethiopia, which Cambyses II afterwards named Meroë. He says ""it was both encompassed by the Nile quite round, and the other rivers, Astapus and Astaboras"" offering protection from both foreign armies and river floods. According to Josephus it was the conquering of Saba that brought great fame to a young Egyptian Prince, simultaneously exposing his personal background as a slave child named Moses. 

Qur'anic tradition

In the Quran, Sheba is mentioned by name at 27:22 in a section that speaks of the visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon Qur'an 27:20-44.   The Qur'an mentions this ancient community along with other communities that were destroyed by God.  Muslim scholars, including Ibn Kathir, related that the People of Sheba were Arabs from South Arabia. 

Ethiopian tradition 

In Orthodox Tewahedo, the Sheba (Saba in Ethiopic) who was Joktan's son is considered their primary ancestor, while Sabtah and Sabtechah, sons of Cush, are considered the ancestors of the Cushitic peoples. Traditional Yemenite genealogies also mention Saba, son of Qahtan (Joktan), however they claim Sabaean descent not from him, but from yet another Saba not mentioned in scripture, who was said to be a grandson of Ya'rub and a great-grandson of Qahtan.

In the medieval Ethiopian Kebra Nagast, Sheba was located in Ethiopia.  Some scholars therefore point to a region in the northern Tigray Region and Eritrea, which was once called Saba (later called Meroë), as a possible link with the biblical Sheba.  Donald N. Levine linka Sheba with Shewa (also written as Shoa, the province where modern Addis Ababa is located) in Ethiopia. 

Speculation on location

The location of the kingdom mentioned in the Bible was long disputed.  Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman suggest that the kingdom was located in southern Arabia. 

Owing to the connection with the Queen of Sheba, the location has become closely linked with national prestige, and various royal houses claimed descent from the Queen of Sheba and Solomon. According to the medieval Ethiopian work Kebra Nagast, Sheba was located in Ethiopia. Ruins in many other countries, including Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia and Iran have been credited as being Sheba, but with only minimal evidence. There has even been a suggestion of a link between the name ""Sheba"" and that of Zanzibar (Shan Sheba); and even a massive earthen monument of the Yoruba people in Nigeria known as Sungbo's Eredo is held by tribal tradition to have been built in honour of the powerful queen Oloye Bilikis Sungbo, who is often equated with the Bilqis of Arabic legend.
Question:
In which present day country is the Biblical land of Sheba?
Answer:
Yemen AR
Passage:
Tommy and Tuppence
Tommy and Tuppence are two fictional detectives, recurring characters in the work of Agatha Christie. Their full names are Thomas Beresford and Prudence Beresford (née Cowley).
The first time Tommy and Tuppence appeared in a Christie novel was in The Secret Adversary (1922). They started out their career as accidental blackmailers  (all in search of adventure and money), but the detecting life soon proved more profitable and much more exciting.

Novels

Tommy and Tuppence appear together in four full-length novels and one collection of short stories    The collection of short stories is Partners in Crime, (1929, each story reminiscent of another writer's work); the four novels are The Secret Adversary (1922),  N or M? (1941), By the Pricking of My Thumbs (1968); and Postern of Fate (1973).  Postern of Fate was the last novel Christie ever wrote, although not the last to be published.

Detectives

Tuppence appears as a charismatic, impulsive and intuitive person, while Tommy is less imaginative, and less likely to be diverted from the truth (as their first adversary sums him up ""he is not clever, but it is hard to blind his eyes to the facts""). They therefore make a good team. It is in this first book The Secret Adversary that they meet up after the war, and come to realise that, although they have been friends for most of their lives, they have now fallen in love with each other.

Unlike many other recurring detective characters, including the better known Christie detectives, Tommy and Tuppence aged in time with the real world, being in their early twenties in The Secret Adversary and in their seventies in Postern of Fate. In their early appearances, they are portrayed as typical upper middle class ""bright young things"" of the 1920s,  and the stories and settings have a more pronounced period-specific flavour than the stories featuring the better known Christie characters. As they age, they're revealed to have raised three children – twins Deborah and Derek and an adopted daughter, Betty. Throughout the series they employ a man named Albert, who first appears as a lift boy who helps them in The Secret Adversary; and subsequently, as a now married pub owner, renders vital assistance to the pair in N or M?. In Partners in Crime, Albert becomes their hapless assistant at a private detective agency; by Postern of Fate he's their butler and has now been widowed. In Postern of Fate they also have a small dog named Hannibal.

Adaptations

In 1953 the BBC adapted Partners in Crime as a radio series starring Richard Attenborough and Sheila Sim.

The Tommy and Tuppence characters have been portrayed on television by James Warwick and Francesca Annis, first in the feature-length The Secret Adversary (1982), and then in the 10 episode series Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime (1983).

The novel By the Pricking of My Thumbs was adapted in 2005 by the French director Pascal Thomas with the title Mon petit doigt m'a dit.... The movie casts André Dussolier as Tommy (renamed Bélisaire) and Catherine Frot as Prudence Beresford. The action is transposed to Savoie in France. A second movie, Le crime est notre affaire, came out in 2008. Le crime est notre affaire is named after Partners in Crime and stars the Beresfords, but its story is based on 4.50 From Paddington, which was originally a novel starring Miss Marple. A third film Associés contre le crime is very, very loosely based (to the point of being unrecognisable) on one of the stories in Partners in Crime.

An adaptation of By the Pricking of My Thumbs appeared in 2006 as an episode of the Granada television series Marple even though Christie did not write Marple into the original story. In this version, Tommy and Tuppence were played by Anthony Andrews and Greta Scacchi respectively, but, unlike in the book, Miss Marple and Tuppence play the detective roles while Tommy is away on intelligence (MI6) business.

BBC television began broadcasting two adaptations, comprising six episodes in 2015. Set in the 1950s and titled Partners in Crime, it starred David Walliams as Tommy  and Jessica Raine as Tuppence.

However, the pigs were ""unpredictable and often quite dangerous"". During filming of one of the kitchen scenes, Maggie Smith was hemmed in by one of the pigs and needed to vault over the back of it in order to escape. 

Awards

The film won three BAFTA Film Awards: best actress for Maggie Smith, best supporting actress for Liz Smith and best supporting actor for Denholm Elliott. It was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay (Alan Bennett) and Best Film.

Eos
In Greek mythology, Ēōs (; Ionic and Homeric Greek , Attic  Éōs, ""dawn"", or; Aeolic  Aúōs, Doric  Āṓs) is a Titaness and the goddess  of the dawn, who rose each morning from her home at the edge of the Oceanus.

Eos had a brother and a sister, Helios, god of the sun, and Selene, goddess of the moon.

Etymology

Eos is cognate to Vedic Sanskrit Ushas and Latin Aurora (Old Latin Ausosa), both goddesses of dawn, and all three considered derivatives of a PIE stem *h₂ewsṓs  (later *Ausṓs), ""dawn"", a stem that also gave rise to Proto-Germanic *Austrō, Old Germanic *Ōstara and Old English Ēostre/Ēastre. This agreement leads to the reconstruction of a Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess.

Greek literature 

The dawn goddess Eos was almost always described with rosy fingers (ῥοδοδάκτυλος, rhododáktylos) or rosy forearms (ῥοδόπηχυς, rhodópēkhys) as she opened the gates of heaven for the Sun to rise.  In Homer,  her saffron-coloured robe is embroidered or woven with flowers;  rosy-fingered and with golden arms, she is pictured on Attic vases as a beautiful woman, crowned with a tiara or diadem and with the large white-feathered wings of a bird.

From The Iliad:

Quintus Smyrnaeus pictured her exulting in her heart over the radiant horses (Lampus and Phaëton) that drew her chariot, amidst the bright-haired Horae, the feminine Hours, climbing the arc of heaven and scattering sparks of fire. 

She is most often associated with her Homeric epithet ""rosy-fingered"" (rhododactylos), but Homer also calls her Eos Erigeneia:

Hesiod wrote:

Thus Eos, preceded by the Morning Star, is seen as the genetrix of all the stars and planets; her tears are considered to have created the morning dew, personified as Ersa or Herse.{Ovid, Metamorphoses 13.621-2}
Eos is the daughter of Hyperion, a bringer of light, the One Above, Who Travels High Above the Earth and of Theia, The Divine. Her brother was the Sun god Helios, and her sister was Selene, the Moon goddess. Her team of horses pull her chariot across the sky and are named in the Odyssey as Firebright and Daybright.

She was the Mother of several notable offspring, including the Winds, Zephyrus, Boreas, and Notus, and the Morning Star, Eosphoros, all of whom she bore to the Titan Astraeus (""of the Stars""), and Memnon, her son by Tithonus.

This rosy-fingered, saffron-robed and golden-throned goddess, who goes up to Olympus to announce the light to the immortals, fell in love several times, and some say it was Aphrodite who cursed her to be perpetually in love, because once had Eos lain with Aphrodite's sweetheart Ares, god of war.

Genealogy

Eos is the daughter of Hyperion and Theia and sister of Helios the sun and Selene the moon, ""who shine upon all that are on earth and upon the deathless gods who live in the wide heaven."" Hesiod told in Theogony (371-374). The generation of Titans preceded all the familiar deities of Olympus, who largely supplanted them.

Lovers and children

According to Pseudo-Apollodorus, Eos consorted with the war god Ares and was thereupon cursed with unsatisfiable sexual desire by the jealous Aphrodite.  This caused her to abduct a number of handsome young men, most notably Cephalus, Tithonus, Orion, and Cleitus. The good-looking Cleitus was made immortal by her.  She also asked for Tithonus to be made immortal, but forgot to ask for eternal youth, which resulted in him living forever as a helpless old man. 

According to Hesiod  by Tithonus Eos had two sons, Memnon and Emathion. Memnon fought among the Trojans in the Trojan War and was slain. Her image with the dead Memnon across her knees, like Thetis with the dead Achilles are icons that inspired the Christian Pietà.

The abduction of Cephalus had special appeal for an Athenian audience because Cephalus was a local boy,  and so this myth element appeared frequently in Attic vase-paintings and was exported with them. In the literary myths  Eos kidnapped Cephalus when he was hunting and took him to Syria. The second-century CE traveller Pausanias was informed that the abductor of Cephalus was Hemera, goddess of Day.  Although Cephalus was already married to Procris, Eos bore him three sons, including Phaeton and Hesperus, but he then began pining for Procris, causing a disgruntled Eos to return him to her — and put a curse on them. In Hyginus' report,  Cephalus accidentally killed Procris some time later after he mistook her for an animal while hunting; in Ovid's Metamorphoses vii, Procris, a jealous wife, was spying on him and heard him singing to the wind, but thought he was serenading his ex-lover Eos.

Etruscan interpretations

Among the Etruscans, the generative dawn-goddess was Thesan. Depictions of the dawn-goddess with a young lover became popular in Etruria in the fifth century, probably inspired by imported Greek vase-painting.  Though Etruscans preferred to show the goddess as a nurturer (Kourotrophos) rather than an abductor of young men, the late Archaic sculptural acroterion from Etruscan Cære, now in Berlin, showing the goddess in archaic running pose adapted from the Greeks, and bearing a boy in her arms, has commonly been identified as Eos and Cephalus.  On an Etruscan mirror Thesan is shown carrying off a young man, whose name is inscribed as Tinthu. 

Roman interpretations

The Roman equivalent of Eos is Aurora, also a cognate showing the characteristic Latin rhotacism. Dawn became associated in Roman cult with Matuta, later known as Mater Matuta. She was also associated with the sea harbors and ports, and had a temple on the Forum Boarium. On June 11, the Matralia was celebrated at that temple in honor of Mater Matuta; this festival was only for women during their first marriage.

Little bustard
The little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) is a large bird in the bustard family, the only member of the genus Tetrax. The genus name is from Ancient Greek and refers to a gamebird mentioned by Aristophanes and others.

It breeds in southern Europe and in western and central Asia. Southernmost European birds are mainly resident, but other populations migrate further south in winter. The central European population once breeding in the grassland of Hungary became extinct several decades ago.

This species is declining due to habitat loss throughout its range. It used to breed more widely, for example ranging north to Poland occasionally. It is only a very rare vagrant to Great Britain despite breeding in France.

Although the smallest Palearctic bustard, the little bustard is still pheasant-sized at 42 – long with a 90 – wingspan and a weight of 830 g. In flight, the long wings are extensively white. The breeding male is brown above and white below, with a grey head and a black neck bordered above and below by white.

The female and non-breeding male lack the dramatic neck pattern, and the female is marked darker below than the male. Immature bustards resemble females. Both sexes are usually silent, although the male has a distinctive ""raspberry-blowing"" call: prrt.

This species is omnivorous, taking seeds, insects, rodents and reptiles. Like other bustards, the male little bustard has a flamboyant display with foot stamping and leaping in the air. Females lay 3 to 5 eggs on the ground.

This bird's habitat is open grassland and undisturbed cultivation, with plants tall enough for cover. It has a stately slow walk, and tends to run when disturbed rather than fly. It is gregarious, especially in winter.

On 20 December 2013, the Cypriot newspapers 'Fileleftheros' and 'Politis', as well as news website 'SigmaLive', reported the discovery of a dead little bustard in the United Nations Buffer Zone. The bird had been shot by poachers hunting illegally in the zone. The shooting was particularly controversial amongst conservationists and birders since the little bustard is a very rare visitor to Cyprus and had not been officially recorded in Cyprus since December 1979.

Venice Gondolas and Gondola Rides - Europe for Visitors
Venice Gondolas and Gondola Rides
Gondolas and Gondola Rides
How to hire a gondolier in Venice, plus a money-saving alternative to gondolas on the Grand Canal.
By Durant Imboden
There are two important rules to remember about gondola rides in Venice:
If the price bothers you, don't do it.
If the price doesn't bother you, make sure you understood the gondolier correctly.
Fact is, a gondola cruise in Venice is like traveling by hansom cab in New York's Central Park: It can be a delightful experience, but only if you're able to forget the price and focus on the ride.
ABOVE: A gondola carries up to six passengers. INSET BELOW: A gondolier in a traditional straw hat, happy gondola passengers, and a squero where gondolas are built and repaired.
What a gondola ride costs
The city of Venice sets official rates for gondola rides, which started at €80 for 40 minutes the last time we checked. Additional 20-minute increments are  €40. After 7 p.m., the base rate climbs to €100, with €50 for an additional 20 minutes. Up to six people can share a gondola.
This doesn't mean you'll actually pay 80 euros, or that you'll get a 40-minute ride. Depending on demand, gondoliers may regard the official rates as a polite fiction. Special services, such as singing, can boost the fare even more. This means you should negotiate both the rate and the length of the ride before you get into the boat. Otherwise, your gondola ride may be memorable for reasons that have nothing to do with sightseeing.
If you dislike negotiating, you can leave that chore to your hotel concierge, though he (or she) may add a hefty surcharge. A few years ago, a reader told us that he'd paid the Hotel Bauer's concierge €120 for a gondola ride just before Carnevale , but he added that he didn't mind the rate and got great service. Another reader (presumably well-heeled) spent a mind-boggling €150 for a 50-minute ride and thought the expenditure was ""well worth it.""
To be fair to Venice's gondoliers, they invest a great deal in their boats: about €20,000 for a traditional hand-built wooden gondola with a useful life of about 20 years. They need to earn the bulk of their annual income in a few short months.
Finally, a gondolier's living costs may be higher than yours, since Venice is an expensive city in one of Italy's wealthiest provinces. Look it at this way: The man who's rowing you up the Grand Canal probably could earn more money for less work at an industrial plant on the mainland.
Question:
In which city would you travel in a gondola?
Answer:
Sestiere (Venice)
Passage:
Goodwood Racecourse
Goodwood Racecourse is a horse-racing track five miles north of Chichester, West Sussex, in England controlled by the family of the Duke of Richmond, whose seat is nearby Goodwood House. It hosts the annual Glorious Goodwood meeting, which is one of the highlights of the British flat racing calendar, and is home to two of the UK's 31 Group One flat races, the Sussex Stakes and the Nassau Stakes.

It is considered to enjoy a very attractive setting  to the north of Trundle Iron Age hill fort, which is used as an informal grandstand with views of the whole course. One problem is that its proximity to the coast means that it can get very foggy.

This is an unusual, complex racecourse with a straight six furlongs — the ""Stewards' Cup Course"" — which is uphill for the first furlong and mostly downhill thereafter. There is a tight right-handed loop at the far end of the straight on which there are starts for various longer distance courses. These include the 1 mile 2 furlongs (1m 2f) ""Craven Course"", the 1m 4f ""Gratwicke Course"" and the 1m 6f ""Bentinck Course"". The start for the 2m 5f ""Cup Course"" is quite close to the winning post – horses travel outwards on the straight, around the loop and back. Throughout the loop there are severe undulations and sharp turns. The course is used for flat racing only.

From 1968 to 1970 the course's late summer meeting was shown on ITV, and from the early 2000s some races from the course occasionally appeared on Channel 4, but otherwise the course had been covered exclusively by the BBC for 50 years from 1956 (when it first appeared on television) to 2006. From 2007, the rights have passed to Channel 4 Racing.

In the late 18th century, Goodwood became the location for the first flag start on a British racecourse, at the behest of Lord George Bentinck, after a particularly shambolic start involving jockey Sam Arnull caused by an elderly deaf starter with a speech impediment.

Amethyst: The purple Quartz mineral Amethyst information ...
Amethyst: The purple Quartz mineral Amethyst information and pictures
Advertising Information
The Mineral amethyst
Amethyst is a well known mineral and gemstone. It is the purple variety of the mineral Quartz , and its most valuable and prized variety. Its name derives from the Greek ""amethystos"", which means ""not drunken"", as Amethyst in antiquity was thought to ward off drunkenness. The color of some Amethyst specimens from certain localities slowly fade upon prolonged exposure to light. When used as a gemstone, Amethyst is often heat treated to deepen the color, or to transform it into Citrine . Some varieties may also change to a light green color, which is given the trade name ""Prasiolite"", or ""Green Amethyst"", as it is more commonly known in the gem trade.
Amethyst is most prevalent as small stubby pyramidal crystals, although several localities such as the Mexican occurrences are well-known for producing elegantly tall prismatic crystals, which are very highly regarded by collectors. Amethyst also forms the internal lining of geode s, some of which can be over 10 feet tall and weighing several tons.
For additional information, see the gemstone section on Amethyst .
USES
Amethyst is one of the most popular gems. It has a beautiful color and is fairly common, making it an inexpensive and widely used gem. Most Amethyst is faceted into jewelry cuts, and some are cut as cabochon s. Large, massive chunks of Amethyst banded with Quartz is sometimes carved into ornaments.
Amethyst is also very popular among mineral collectors. Small geode sections and tumbled stones are sold to amateur collectors, while more serious collectors go for the rare prismatic crystals and giant geode sections.
NOTEWORTHY LOCALITIES
Amethyst is a very common mineral and is found worldwide. Only a select few of the most famous localities will be mentioned here.
Tall, prismatic , well-shaped crystals are restricted to several Mexican localities: Piedras Parado and Las Vigas de Ramirez, both in Veracruz; and Amatitlan, in Guerro. They occur in elongated crystals that are rarely faceted , since collectors pay well for these rarities. Another excellent Mexican locality is Guanajuato, where plates of stubby crystals are found.
Enormous quantities of Amethyst come from Minas Gerais, Brazil, which contains the famous Rio Grande do Sul, where huge crystal-lined Amethyst geode s are found, especially in Ametista do Sul. Another South American country, Uruguay, produces deeply colored crystals in large geodes and pipe s in Artigas, near the Brazilian border. Another good South American locality, which is especially noted for Ametrine , is the Anahi Mine, Santa Cruz, Bolivia.
Large amounts of Amethyst are found both in Namibia and South Africa -- these are often labeled in the jewelry industry as ""African Amethyst"". In Namibia, an interesting occurrence is the Goboboseb Mountains, near Brandberg, in the Erongo Mountains, where crystals are zoned in lighter to darker colors. In South Africa, extensive deposits are in Boekenhoutshoek (Magaliesberg), Mkobola district, where the Amethyst occurs with a spiky overgrowth of small crystals (popularly called "" Cactus Quartz ""). Very dark and clear Amethyst was once found  in Russia in the Ural Mountains and  Siberia; and a drusy , lilac-colored Amethyst in globular  associations has recently come from Nyiri, in northeastern Hungary.
There are two notable Canadian occurrences. One is Thunder Bay, Ontario, where specimens contain an internal coating of red Hematite . The other locality is the area of Digby, Nova Scotia, where naturally rounded, waterworn Amethyst pebbles are found on the beaches along the Bay of Fundy.
In the U.S., fine Amethyst crystals comes from the Four Peaks (in the  Mazatzal Mountains), Gila Co., Arizona; in the Pohndorf Mine, Jefferson Co., Montana; Crystal Park, Beaverhead Co., Montana; the Pennoyer Mine at Redfeather Lakes, Larimer Co., Colorado; and at Deer Hill, Oxford Co., Maine. There are several good localities in the Carolinas, specifically Statesville, Iredell Co., North Carolina; the Reel Mine, Iron Station, Lincoln Co., North Carolina; and Abbeville Co., South Carolina (the Diamond Hill Quartz Mine and the Ellis Jones Mine). A recently productive location producing deep purple crystals is Jackson's Crossroads, Wilkes Co., Georgia. Diamond Hill in Ashaway, Hopkinton, Washington Co., Rhode Island is known for the rare scepter s that were found there. Amethyst is also found in the traprock quarries of Passaic Co., New Jersey, specifically at the Upper New Street Quarry in Paterson and at Prospect Park.

It takes its name after the Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi, who first popularised its use during the Indian independence movement. Worn commonly by Indian independence activists, it became a symbolic tradition for politicians and political activists to wear it in independent India. In 2011, the Gandhi cap once again rose in popularity in India after Anna Hazare, an eminent Gandhian from Maharashtra, started an anti-corruption movement in India. The cap remains the most popular everyday headgear worn by men in rural parts of Maharashtra. In the 2014 election, the workers of Aaam Aadmi Party (AAP) won the most seats in the Lok Sabha, but not the seats of the Congress party (which won the majority of seats). The Congress party lost its popular and political appeal in later times, although many members of the party continued the tradition. In 1964, a coin showing Jawaharlal Nehru in profile was released which was widely criticized for lacking the cap. Another Nehru coin was later released in 1989 on his birth centenary, which showed him wearing a cap. In 2012, thousands of people wearing Gandhi caps accumulated at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi to supportAnna Hazare on his fast-unto-death. The mass movement witnessed people of all age groups, religions and social standings (mainly the Middle Class) as participants. The epicenter of this movement was in Delhi, but the movement spilled over to many other parts of the country and stadiums, community centers and grounds were booked for assimilation of a similar nature. The movement was witnessed by people from all ages, religions, social standings and social classes. The Middle Class (mainley the Middle class) were among them shouting slogans and wearing Gandhi cap. The campaign was led by the Indian National Congress, which won the election by a margin of more than 2.5 million to 1,000,000. It was the first Indian election to be won by a non-Congress party candidate since independence in 1950. The party won the general election in 1951.

The North Pennines range is the northernmost section of the Pennine hills which runs north–south through northern England. It lies between Carlisle to the west and Darlington to the east. It is bounded to the north by the Tyne Valley and to the south by the Stainmore Gap. It was designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in 1988 for its moorland scenery, the product of centuries of farming and lead-mining. At almost 2000 km2 it is the second largest of the 49 AONBs in the United Kingdom. The landscape is one of open heather moors between deep dales, upland rivers, hay meadows and stone-built villages, some of which contain the legacies of a mining and industrial past. The area is notable for rare plants not found elsewhere in Britain, including wild flora and fauna, including red squirrels, otters and rare arctic alpine plants. There are 22,000 pairs of breeding waders and one of England's biggest waterfalls – High Force on the River Tees. The region is home to England's only named winders traversing the plateaux around Cross Fell, the Eden Fell and the Helmside valleys between Alston and Helmside. W. H. Auden visited the area in 1919 and some forty poems are set here. He referred to the region as his ""Mutterland"", his ""great good place"" and equated it with his idea of 'great good' and'mutter' The area was visited by the great English poet W.H.Auden five years later and some 40 years later was writing poems about Alston. The poem is called 'The Moor and the Moorland' and can be read at: http://www.cricinfo.com/magazine/story/393261/great-good-land.html. It also has the name 'Eden Moor and Allendale' which means 'Moor of the Moor' or 'Allendale Moor' in the local dialect. It's also known as 'Alston Moor' and as 'The Allendale Tea Trail' which is a circular route of 58 km around the area, running from Ninebanks via Allendale, Nenthead and Alston in the North. The President of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the U.S. As chief of the executive branch and face of the federal government as a whole, the presidency is the highest political office in the US by influence and recognition. The president is indirectly elected to a four-year term by an Electoral College (or by the House of Representatives, should the Electoral College fail to award an absolute majority of votes to any person) There have been 43 people sworn into office, and 44 presidencies, as Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is counted chronologically as both the 22nd and 24th president. Of the individuals elected as president, four died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison,  Zachary Taylor,  Warren G. Harding,  and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln,  James A. Garfield,  William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy) and one resigned (Richard Nixon) Living former presidents are: Gerald Ford (1974–77) on December 26, 2006, aged. The most recently serving president to die was Ronald Reagan (1981–89) on June 5, 2004, aged. Four presidents—John Q. Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, Benjamin Harrison, and George W. Bush—lost the popular vote but assumed office; Bush was subsequently re-elected with a popular majority. The current president, Barack Obama, is the first president of African descent. There are four living former presidents. The most recent death of a former president was that of GeraldFord (1974-77) in December 2006. The list does not include any acting presidents under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United United States Constitution, which took effect on March 4, 1789.

Vesti la giubba (""Put on the costume"") is a famous tenor aria from Ruggero Leoncavallo's 1892 opera Pagliacci. The pain of Canio is portrayed in the aria and exemplifies the entire notion of the ""tragic clown"": smiling on the outside but crying on the inside. The melody of the song was utilized by the rock band Queen in their 1984 single ""It's a Hard Life"" When frontman Freddie Mercury sang the song's opening lyrics ""I don't want my freedom, there's no reason for living with a broken heart"" The view that the biblical kingdom of Sheba was the ancient civilization of Saba in South Arabia is controversial. The story of Solomon and Sheba is ""an anachronistic seventh-century set piece meant to legitimize the participation of Judah in the lucrative Arabian trade"" The British Museum states that there is no archaeological evidence for such a queen but that the kingdom described as hers was Saba, ""the oldest and most important of the South Arabian kingdoms""   Kenneth Kitchen dates the kingdom to between 1200 BCE until 275 CE with its capital, Ma'rib. The Kingdom fell after a long but sporadic civil war between several Yemenite dynasties claiming kingship,   resulting in the rise of the late Himyarite Kingdom. The two names Sheba (spelled in Hebrew with shin) and Seba are mentioned several times in the Bible with different genealogy. For instance, in the Generations of Noah  Seba, along with Dedan, is listed as a descendant of Noah's son Ham (as sons of Raamah, son of Cush). Later on in Genesis,  Sheba and Dedan are listed as names of sons of Jokshan, sons of Abraham, and Joktan. One theory is that the Sabaeans hailed from the southern Levant and established their kingdom on the ruins of the Minaeans. It remains a theory however and cannot be confirmed. The most famous claim to fame for the Biblical land of SheBA was the story of the Queen of the land of the Sheba, who travelled to Jerusalem to question King Solomon, who asked her for help in defeating the Philistines. Sheba has been mentioned in Ethiopian, Hebrew and Qur'anic traditions, among other things it was the home of the biblical ""Queen of She ba"" (named Makeda in Ethiopian tradition and Bilqīs in Arabic tradition) In the Quran, Sheba is mentioned by name at 27:22 in a section that speaks of the visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon Qur'an 27:20-44. The location of the kingdom mentioned in the Bible was long disputed. Some scholars point to a region in the northern Tigray Region and Eritrea, which was once called Saba (later called Meroë), as a possible link with the biblical Sheba. Ruins in many other countries, including Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia and Iran have been credited as being Sheba, but with only minimal evidence. There has even been a suggestion of a link between the name ""Sheba"" and that of Zanzibar (Shan Sheba) and even a massive earthen monument of the Yoruba people in Nigeria known as Sungbo's Eredo is held by tribal tradition to have been built in honour of the powerful queen Oloye Bilikis Sungbo, who is often equated with the Bilqis of Arabic legend. The first time Tommy and Tuppence appeared in a Christie novel was in The Secret Adversary (1922). They started out their career as accidental blackmailers, but soon proved more profitable and much more exciting. They appear together in four full-length novels and a collection of short stories. The collection is reminiscent of another writer's work, each story is another story from Agatha Christie's work. The four novels are The SecretAdversary, The Pricking of My Thumbs, By Thumbs and Partners in Crime (1941), By Nurnberg and Thumbs of My Fate (1973) and Poernern of Posternern (1973). The short stories are also reminiscent of the writer's other work, Nurnern or M? (1929), Nern of Nurnurn or M?, (1939) and By Nern or Thumbs in the Poern (1949) The short story collection is also called By Narn or Thumb in thePoern, (1951) and the short story is called The Thumbs In The Poern, the Pricking In The Thumb (1953). The full collection is available in hardback, paperback and e-book formats. The full story is available on Amazon.com, the Kindle, the Nook, the iPad and the Kindle. tern of Fate was the last novel Christie ever wrote, although not the last to be published. Tommy and Tuppence aged in time with the real world, being in their early twenties in The Secret Adversary and in their seventies in Postern of Fate. In their early appearances, they are portrayed as typical upper middle class ""bright young things"" of the 1920s. They're revealed to have raised three children – twins Deborah and Derek and an adopted daughter, Betty. Throughout the series they employ a man named Albert, who first appears as a lift boy who helps them. In Partners in Crime, Albert becomes their hapless assistant at a private detective agency. By the Pricking of My Thumbs was adapted in 2005 by the French director Pascal Thomas with the title Mon petit doigt m'a dit.... The movie casts André Dussolier as Tommy (renamed Bélisaire) and Catherine Frot as Prudence Beresford. A second movie, Le crime est notre affaire, came out in 2008. The story is based on 4.50 From Paddington, which was originally a novel starring Miss Marple. A third film Associés contre le crime is very, very loosely based (to the point of being unrecognisable) on one of the stories in Partners in crime. In a small Northern English town in 1947, citizens endure continuing food rationing. Some local businessmen want to hold a party to celebrate the royal wedding of Princess Elizabeth to Prince Philip. They illegally decide to raise a pig to raise the food ration of the Prince of Wales. In N or M? they also have a small dog named Hannibal. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99. To order a copy of the book for £12.99, call 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local bookshop or click here for more information on Christie’s other books and her estate. For more information about the Christie estate, visit the Christie Estate’S website. The Christie Estate is open to the public and can be contacted on 0300 123 9090 or on www.Christie Estate.co.uk. Three pigs were used in the filming of A Private Function, all named Betty. Producer Mark Shivas was advised by Intellectual Animals UK that the pigs used should be female and six months old so as to not be too large or aggressive. Maggie Smith was hemmed in by one of the pigs and needed to vault over the back of it in order to escape. A musical based on the film opened in the West End in April 2011, under the new title Betty Blue Eyes. It was produced by Cameron Mackintosh and ran for several months at the Novello Theatre. It starred Reece Shearsmith (of The League of Gentlemen fame) as Gilbert, and actress Sarah Lancashire as Joyce. The new musical 'Betty Blue Eyes' is based on a film of the same name starring Michael Palin and Maggie Smith. The film won three BAFTA Film Awards: best actress for Maggie Smith, best supporting actress for Liz Smith and best supporting actor for Denholm Elliott. In Greek mythology, Ēōs (; Ionic and Homeric Greek, Attic  Éōs, ""dawn"") is a Titaness and the goddess  of the dawn, who rose each morning from her home at the edge of the Oceanus. In Homer,  her saffron-coloured robe is embroidered or woven with flowers;  rosy-fingered and with golden arms, she is pictured as a beautiful woman crowned with a tiara or diadem and with the white wings of a bird. This agreement leads to the reconstruction of a Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess. The Iliad portrayed her as radiant and exulting over the radiant horses and chariot that drew her over the chariot, amidst the bright-haired Horiot, the Morning Star and the Star of the Morning. She is most often associated with her Homeric epithet ""rosy-fingerered"" (rhododáktylos) or rosy forearms (ῥöδάκτυλος, rhodópēkhys) as she opened the gates of heaven for the Sun to rise. In. Greek literature, she had a brother and a sister, Helios, god of the sun, and Selene, goddess of the moon, and Helios' sister was Helios's wife, Selene. She was also cognate to Vedic Sanskrit Ushas and Latin Aurora (Old Latin Ausosa), both goddesses of dawn, and all three considered derivatives of a PIE stem *h₂ewsṓs. Eos is the daughter of Hyperion and Theia and sister of Helios the sun and Selene the moon. She was the Mother of several notable offspring, including the Winds, Zephyrus, Boreas, and Notus. Eos consorted with the war god Ares and was thereupon cursed with unsatisfiable sexual desire by the jealous Aphrodite. This caused her to abduct a number of handsome young men, most notably Cephalus, Tithonus, Orion, and Cleitus. Her image with the dead Memnon across her knees are icons that inspired the Christian Pietà. The Roman equivalent of Eos is Aurora, a characteristic Latin rhotacism also known as Materuta, later known as Matuta, and associated with the sea ports of Matuta. The Tetrax family is the only member of the genus Tetrax from which Eos was descended. The only family member of Tetrax is a large bird in the family Tetrax (Tetrax tetrax) which is a family member in the genus Tetrax (Little Tetrax) The only Tetrax member from the Tetrax genus is the large bustard (The little bustard) of the goddess Tetrax, which is inscribed with the name Tinthu (Tinthu) on its head. The goddess of the dawn was associated with Matuta and had a temple on the Forum Boarium on June 11, the day of the temple's festival in honor of Materia. Her team of horses pull her chariot across the sky and are named in the Odyssey as Firebright and Daybright. She had two sons, Memnon and Emathion, who fought among the Trojans in the Trojan War and was slain. In the literary myths  Eos kidnapped Cep Halus when he was hunting and took him to Syria. The second-century CE traveller Pausanias was informed that the abductor of CepHalus was Hemera, goddess of Day. Though Etruscans preferred to show the goddess as a nurturer (Kourotrophos) rather than an abductor, a late Archaic sculptural acroterion from Etruscan Cære, now in Berlin, showing the goddess in archaic running pose adapted from the Greeks, and bearing a boy in her arms, has commonly been identified as Eos and Cep halus. The good-looking Cleitus was made immortal by her. She also asked for Tith onus to be made immortal, but forgot to ask for eternal youth, which resulted in him living forever as a helpless old man. The little bustard is still pheasant-sized at 42 – long with a 90 – wingspan and a weight of 830 g. The breeding male is brown above and white below, with a grey head and a black neck bordered above and below by white. The female and non-breeding male lack the dramatic neck pattern, and the female is marked darker below than the male. Immature bustards resemble females. Both sexes are usually silent, although the male has a distinctive ""raspberry-blowing"" call: prrt.reek and refers to a gamebird mentioned by Aristophanes and others. The city of Venice sets official rates for gondola rides, which started at €80 for 40 minutes the last time we checked. After 7 p.m., the base rate climbs to €100, with €50 for an additional 20 minutes. Up to six people can share a gondolas. A gondolier in a traditional straw hat can carry up to six passengers on a ride of up to 40 minutes. The price of a ride in Venice is like traveling by hansom cab in New York's Central Park: It can be a delightful experience, but only if you're able to forget the price and focus on the ride. If the price bothers you, don't do it. If you dislike negotiating, you can leave that chore to your hotel concierge before the boat leaves. A few years ago, a reader told us that he'd paid €120 for a gONDola ride just before Carnevale, but he added that he didn't mind the rate and went and go and had a go and go. It's possible to get a ride for less than the official rate. Special services, such as singing, can boost the fare even more. The best way to see the Grand Canal is to take a guided tour with a guide. The guide will take you around the area and explain the best places to stop and what to do in the city.

It hosts the annual Glorious Goodwood meeting, which is one of the highlights of the British flat racing calendar. It is home to two of the UK's 31 Group One flat races, the Sussex Stakes and the Nassau Stakes. In the late 18th century, Goodwood became the location for the first flag start on a British racecourse, at the behest of Lord George Bentinck, after a shambolic start caused by an elderly deaf starter with a speech impediment. The course is considered to enjoy a very attractive setting  to the north of Trundle Iron Age hill fort, used as an informal grandstand with views of the whole course. One problem is that its proximity to the coast means that it can get very foggy. The racecourse has a straight six furlongs — the ""Stewards' Cup Course"" — which is uphill for theFirst furlong and mostly downhill thereafter. The start for the 2m 5f ""Cup Course"" is quite close to the winning post – horses travel outwards on the straight, around the loop and back. Throughout the loop there are severe undulations and sharp turns. Thecourse is used for flat racing only. From 1968 to 1970 the course's late summer meeting was shown on ITV, and from the early 2000s some races from the course occasionally appeared on Channel 4, but otherwise the course had been covered exclusively by the BBC for 50 years from 1956 (when it first appeared on television) to 2006. The name derives from the Greek ""amethystos"", which means ""not drunken"", as Amethyst in antiquity was thought to ward off drunkenness. Amethyst is the purple variety of the mineral Quartz, and its most valuable and prized variety. The color of some Amethyst specimens from certain localities slowly fade upon prolonged exposure to light. When used as a gemstone, amethyst is often heat treated to deepen the color, or to transform it to a light green color. Some varieties of Amethyst are known as ""Prasiolite"", or ""Green Amethyst"", as well as ""Amethystite"" or ""Asiolite"" Some varieties are also known as small stubby pyramidal crystals, which are well-known for producing elegantly tall prismatic crystals. Amethyst is one of the most popular gems. It has a beautiful color and is fairly common, making it an inexpensive and widely used gem. Most Amethyst is faceted into jewelry cuts, and some are cut as cabochon s. Amethyst also forms the internal lining of geode s, some of which can be over 10 feet tall and weighing several tons.

Painting of James Hogg, poet and novelist (1770-1835)
Introduction:
James Hogg (1770-1835) had little formal education, which makes the range and quality of his literary output all the more surprising. Born on a farm at Ettrick, he had ambitions to be a writer from an early age and came to believe that he might emulate Burns. He was still working as a shepherd when his first, unsuccessful, volume of poems appeared in 1801. The following year he met Scott who would champion him over many years.

Description:
Hogg's appearance on the literary scene was established by The Queen's Wake which came out in 1813. Many times reprinted, it contains his most quoted piece of verse, 'Kilmeny'. Thereafter his work ranged from the brilliant parodies of contemporary poets in The Poetic Mirror to the works in prose: The Brownie of Bodsbeck, The Three Perils of Man, and, most remarkable of all, The Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner, which introduced the theme of the evil doppelganger into Scottish literature.

Pouchong
Pouchong (; Standard Chinese pronunciation) or light oolong, it is a lightly fermented (oxidized) tea, twist shape, with floral notes, and usually not roasted, somewhere between green tea and what is usually considered Oolong tea (), though often classified with the latter due to its lack of the sharper green tea flavours.  It is produced mainly in Fujian, China, and in Pinglin Township near Taipei, Taiwan.

Its name in Chinese, literally ""the wrapped kind"", refers to a  practice of wrapping the leaves in paper during the drying process that has largely been discontinued due to advancement in tea processing.  At its best, Pouchong gives off a floral and melon fragrance and has a rich, mild taste.
Usually around the end of March, begins picking of this famous Taiwan ""spring tea"" (春茶).
Pouchong is a popular choice with producers of scented tea, with rose pouchong a particular favourite.

Before 1873, oolong tea was widely sold in Mainland China and Taiwan, but after an economic slump, some tea companies stopped selling oolong tea because of decreasing demand. At this time, tea companies moved production from Taiwan to Fuzhou and began producing pouchong tea. Pouchong tea is referred to as “flower tea” because of its fragrant smell.

Health benefits

Together with green tea, oolong tea, and black tea, Pouchong tea has been shown to have antioxidant activity and antimutagenic properties.  Tea catechins are important antioxidants and one study found Pouchong tea to have over three times the amount of these compounds relative to black tea, although it was found to have less than green or oolong teas.
The name pouchong comes into the English language from the Chinese name (). 

Pouchong tea in Taiwan

Farmers from Taiwan imported trees and growing techniques from Fujian during the nineteenth century. The name of pouchong tea means “wrapped” tea and refers to the former paper package style. The most popular kinds of pouchong tea are from the Nankang and Wenshan regions. It has been produced since about 1885, but today very little is  grown. Wenshan Pouchong Tea is also one of the ten most popular teas in Taiwan.

Characteristics

The appearance of pouchong tea is similar to a rope and is curled up. It has a deep green color with tiny grayish white spots. The fermentation is between 8 and 12%. It has a delicate fragrance similar to fresh flowers. The taste is not harsh and its sweet flavor has a moisturizing effect.[http://www.doed.taipei.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem27982219&CtNode

Northgate Mall (Seattle)
Northgate Mall is a shopping mall in the Northgate district of north urban Seattle, Washington.  It is anchored by Bed Bath & Beyond, JCPenney, Macy's and Nordstrom.

History

An open-air retail hub in the northern environs of Seattle, Northgate Mall was one of the first post-war, suburban mall-type shopping centers in the United States. Originally known as Northgate Center, it began business with 18 stores in April 1950. By 1952, the fully leased structure housed over seventy tenants,  and the adjoined 4-story Northgate Building medical/dental center and Northgate Theatre, which seated over 1300 patrons. 

Northgate was the first of three Puget Sound-area malls developed by Allied Stores (parent company of The Bon Marché) and designed by Seattle architect John Graham, Jr. The development was built over part of Thornton Creek, on land that had been a cranberry bog in Maple Leaf neighborhood.
  ""NN-1030S"", ""NN-1040S"".jpg dated 17 June 2002.
(1) 
  (2)   See heading, ""Note about limitations of these data"". Northgate was the first regional shopping center in the United States to be described as a mall, in this instance a double row of stores facing each other across a covered pedestrian walkway, and was the first mall to have public restrooms. 

In 1952, Redmond sculptor Dudley C. Carter designed and carved the 59 ft cedar totem pole that decorated the grand entrance to the central retail corridor, known as the ""Miracle Mall"". The shopping center was originally anchored by The Bon Marché (renamed Macy's 2005). There were also a J.J. Newberry 5 and 10, Butler Brothers variety store and an A & P Supermarket.

Other tenants signing on early that still exist were National Bank of Commerce (bought by Norwest Corporation, renamed Wells Fargo) and locally owned Nordstrom's Shoes. This was expanded into a full line clothing store in 1965. Opened as a Best's Apparel, a division of the Nordstrom Company since 1963, it was rebranded as Nordstrom Best in 1967 and Nordstrom in 1973. The 1965 expansion that added the Best's Apparel store also included an extension of the south end of the complex. This was anchored by a new J.C. Penney and QFC (Quality Food Center) grocery.

The ""Miracle Mall"" concourse had been partially enclosed with a ""SkyShield"" structure in 1962. This was replaced in 1973-1974, with the mall corridor being fully enclosed. The official name of the shopping complex was changed to Northgate Mall at this time. Seattle-based Lamonts added a store to the northern end of the concourse in 1977. After the acquisition of the Lamonts department store chain by Gottschalks in 2000, Gottschalks was located at Northgate Mall until September 2006.  It closed after six years due to underperforming sales, and the former location is currently the home to DSW and Bed, Bath and Beyond. In January 2012, Toys ""R"" Us closed which coincided with the end of its lease. 

Capitalizing on Northgate's success, Allied Stores commissioned Graham to design the fully enclosed Tacoma Mall, which opened in 1964, and Tukwila's Southcenter Mall in 1968.  By 1980, there were 123 stores at Northgate Mall. Construction began in the summer of 2006 on a 100000 sqft lifestyle-type addition to the mall. This was completed in early 2008.Wilma (2005)  Anchor stores are Nordstrom, Macy's, J.C. Penney, and Bed Bath and Beyond. 

Green River Killer

On September 12, 1983, Tracy Ann Winston was abducted from Northgate Mall and murdered by Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer.  

Northgate Mall remodeling project 

In 2006, Simon Properties embarked on an expansion of Northgate Mall, in part because of the city's plan for revitalizing the Northgate neighborhood.  The expansion plans included a new outdoor ""urban-village"" on the western end of the mall facing Interstate 5. This village opened in November 2007.

A new five level parking garage at the south end of the mall provides parking for mall users and additional transit parking. The totem pole at the north entrance of the mall was removed in September 2007.   Around the same time, the original Northgate Theatre and 4-story Northgate Building were demolished to make space for new tenants.

Location

The mall is bounded on the north by NE Northgate Way (formerly NE 110th Street), on the west by 1st Avenue NE, on the south by NE 103rd Street, and on the east by 5th Avenue NE.  The Northgate informal district and Northgate Way were both named after the mall.   The original mall has itself become the anchor for development of surrounding apartment buildings, retail and light commercial blocks and community spaces, all now part of a more comprehensive plan for growth such as the opportunities and impacts of transit facilities and the light rail station for the district.(1) Langston, for one example of numerous.  (2)   (3)   (4)   (5) See also GI Joes–Target complex c. early 2000s, and Group Health Northgate (1958) [HistoryLink Staff].

Transit 

The first express bus service in Washington State was launched with service between Northgate and Downtown (1970).  The ""Blue Streak"" served as a model for dozens of additional park-and-ride routes implemented by Metro Transit over western King County and linking with Snohomish and Pierce counties. 

Northgate will be an elevated Link Light Rail station to the west of the mall, connected to the Northgate Transit Center. It will be the final station on the Northgate Link Extension, scheduled to open in 2021, and the first above-ground station north of Downtown Seattle.

Marriott Edgar
Marriott Edgar (1880–1951), born George Marriott Edgar in Kirkcudbright, Scotland, was a poet, scriptwriter and comedian best known for writing many of the monologues performed by Stanley Holloway, particularly the 'Albert' series. 
In total he wrote sixteen monologues for Stanley Holloway, whilst Holloway himself wrote only five.

Family background

Edgar's parents were Jennifer née Taylor, a native of Dundee, and Richard Horatio Marriott Edgar (1847–1894), only son of Alice Marriott (1824–1900), proprietress of the Marriott family theatre troupe. Richard was born in Manchester, Lancashire, near Christmas 1847 as Richard Horatio Marriott; both his two sisters, Adeline Marriott (b. 1853) and Grace Marriott (b. 1858) were also born in Lancashire. Later all three children chose to take the surname of their mother's husband, Robert Edgar, whom she married in 1856.[http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/search.pl?start

Richard and Jenny married in March 1875, with Richard being unaware that he had fathered an illegitimate namesake son, Richard Horatio Edgar Wallace, with widowed actress Mrs Mary Jane ""Polly"" Richards, after a brief sexual encounter. Polly had invented an obligation in London to hide her pregnancy and give birth in secret on 1 April 1875, almost a month after Richard and Jenny married. This son became the famous journalist, novelist, playwright and screenplay writer Edgar Wallace.

Richard and Jenny Taylor's children were Alice Marriott Edgar (b. 1876, London), twins Richard and Jennifer Marriott Edgar (b. 1878, London), after whose births the family moved to Scotland where George was born, then  returning to London where Joseph Marriott Edgar was born in 1884 and Adeline Alice Edgar in 1886.

Early career

Little is recorded of George Marriott Edgar's early career, but he was talented performer, poet and writer. His first real successes began after he had been in the cast of The Co-Optimists and worked with Stanley Holloway.[http://www.classicsonline.com/catalogue/product.aspx?pid
718 Cary Ginell on Stanley Holloway at classicsonline.com] At the start of the 1930s they went to Hollywood, where Edgar - who had dropped his first name for the professional appellation Marriott Edgar - met his famous half-brother.

Monologues

Holloway was already enjoying some success with the monologue format, with such classics as Sam, Pick Oop Tha' Musket. Edgar asked him if he had heard a story about a couple who had taken their son to the zoo, only to see the lad eaten by a lion.  Holloway had indeed heard the story, and shortly afterwards Edgar supplied him with a script.  The Lion and Albert became one of Holloway's most popular pieces, one of many he recorded beginning in 1930. The lion of the poem is named ""Wallace"", which was the name of the first African lion to be bred in Britain, living from 1812 until 1838, and his name became a popular one for lions.[http://www.ravishingbeasts.com/lions/2006/11/3/wallace-the-lion.html Wallace the lion at ravishingbeasts.com] Edgar gave the poem the titleThe Lion and Albert but some later performances and re-publications used the form Albert and the Lion.[http://www.seiyaku.com/lit/monologues/003.html The Lion and Albert ] The nearby pub also uses the latter form.

The monologues were designed to be spoken rhythmically, with piano accompaniment which in many cases was also composed by Edgar.for examples see The texts were published by Francis, Day & Hunter during the 1930s in three collections. All were illustrated by John Hassall, many of whose lively images also became classics. Edgar's compositions were

Passage:
Adamstown, Pitcairn Islands
Adamstown is the only settlement on, and as such, the capital of, the Pitcairn Islands.

Overview

Adamstown has a population of 56, which is the entire population of the Pitcairn Islands: all the other islands in the group are uninhabited. Adamstown is where most residents eat, drink and sleep, while they grow food in other areas of the island. 

The hamlet currently is the second smallest capital in the world. It has access to television, satellite internet, and a telephone. The main means of communication is still the ham radio. According to Google Maps, the only named road in the capital is called ""The Hill of Difficulty"". A small amount of the population, around 10 people, live around the only district in Pitcairn Islands, Kundur Marqa, which is an Asian district.

History

The history of the Pitcairn Islands begins with the colonization of the islands by Polynesians in the 11th century. The Polynesians established a culture that flourished for four centuries and then vanished. Pitcairn was settled again in 1790 by a group of British mutineers on HMS Bounty and Tahitians.

Geography

The settlement is located on the central-north side of the island of Pitcairn, facing the Pacific Ocean and close to the Bounty Bay, the only seaport of the island.

Climate

Adamstown has a wet warm climate averaging 67 in of rain a year. The wettest month is July. Temperatures do not change much during the year.

Passage:
I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair
""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair"" is a song from the musical South Pacific, sung by Nellie Forbush, the female lead, originally played by Mary Martin in the 1949 Broadway production. Her character, fed up with a man (Emile De Becque) and singing energetically in the shower, claims that she will forget about him.  The song was written by Rodgers and Hammerstein in response to Martin's request.  She had starred on Broadway for years and Martin suggested that she actually wash her hair on stage during the performance.  

""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair"" was adapted for a commercial jingle for Clairol hair coloring in the 1970s.  PJ Harvey referenced the song in her 1992 single ""Sheela-Na-Gig"" with the repeated lyric ""gonna wash that man right outa my hair"".  50 Foot Wave's song ""Bone China"" also references this song in the lyric, ""Gonna wash that man right out of my head / and soap him into my eyes"".

The song was covered in the 2004 film Connie and Carla by the title characters (portrayed by Nia Vardalos & Toni Collette).

Recordings 

*Diana Miller, Arne Domnérus and his orchestra. Recorded in Stockholm on September 22, 1952. It was released on the 78rpm record His Master's Voice X 7829.

Illiers-Combray
Illiers-Combray is a commune in the Eure-et-Loir department in north central France.

Population

Literature

Combray was the writer Marcel Proust's name for the village of Illiers (near the Cathedral town of Chartres), vividly depicted by him in the opening chapters of his vast semi-autobiographical novel In Search of Lost Time. 

The home of Proust's ""Aunt Léonie"" in the heart of the village, where he spent much of his childhood, has been transformed into a museum to the writer's memory. It provides visitors with a delightful view of 19th century provincial life as well as of the many Proustian mementos on display. 

It should be added that Proust scholars have recently claimed his descriptions of ""Combray"" owe as much to the author's stays in his uncle's home in Auteuil, near Paris, as to Illiers-Combray.

As a tribute to Proust's literary masterpiece, the people of Illiers decided, in 1971, to change the town's name to Illiers-Combray, on the occasion of the first centenary of the author's birth.
Question:
The French commune of Illiers adopted the name Illiers-Combray in homage to which author whose vivid recreation of the town (through recollection) opens his vast magnum opus?
Answer:
Valentin-Louis-Georges-Eugene-Marcel Proust
Passage:
Secretary of State for Education
Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Education (frequently shortened to the Education Secretary) is the chief minister of the Department for Education in the United Kingdom government. The position was re-established on 12 May 2010.  Under the provisions for devolved government in the UK its remit applies only to England, covering; 
* Early years   
* Adoption and child protection
* Teachers’ pay
* The school curriculum
* School improvement
* The establishment of academies and free schools.

History

A committee of the Privy Council was appointed in 1839 to supervise the distribution of certain government grants in the education field. The members of the committee were the Lord President of the Council, the Secretaries of State, the First Lord of the Treasury, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. From 1857 a vice-president was appointed who took responsibility for policy.

On 1 April 1900, the Board of Education Act 1899 abolished the committee and instituted a new board, headed by a president. The members were initially very similar to the old committee and the president of the board was the Lord President of the Council; however, from 1902 this ceased to be the case and the president of the board was appointed separately (although the Marquess of Londonderry happened to hold both jobs from 1903 to 1905).

The Education Act 1944 replaced the Board of Education with a new Ministry of Education.

The Department of Education and Science was created in 1964 with the merger of the offices of Minister of Education and the Minister of Science.

In 1992 the responsibility for science was transferred to Cabinet Office's Office of Public Service, and the department was renamed Department of Education. In 1995 the department merged with the Department of Employment to become the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) and in 2001 the employment functions were transferred to a newly created Department for Work and Pensions, with the DfEE becoming the Department for Education and Skills (DfES). In 2007 under Gordon Brown's new premiership, the DfES was split into two new departments; the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and a Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, under two new secretaries of state.

The ministerial office of the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills was, in late 2009, amalgamated into the new ministerial office of the resurgent politician, Peter Mandelson, made a peer and given the title Lord Mandelson as the newly created Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills – itself an amalgamation of the responsibilities of the Secretaries of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and Innovation, Universities and Skills – the Secretary of State has remit over higher education policy as well as British business and enterprise. As of 14 July 2016, the position is held by Justine Greening as her predesseccesor, Nicky Morgan was sacked by Theresa May.

Question:
Who is Secretary of State for Education?
Answer:
Nicky Morgan (disambiguation)
Passage:
Windward and leeward
Windward is the direction upwind (toward where the wind is coming from) from the point of reference. Leeward is the direction downwind (or downward) from the point of reference. The side of a ship that is towards the leeward is its lee side. If the vessel is heeling under the pressure of the wind, this will be the ""lower side"". During the age of sail, the term weather was used as a synonym for windward in some contexts, as in the weather gage.

Pronunciation

The traditional nautical pronunciations are the elided forms  and, but this is regarded as old-fashioned. The literal pronunciations, and, are more common. The pronunciation for the Leeward and Windward Islands and the Leeward Antilles is normally the latter form. 

Origin

The term lee derives from Old English hleo, shelter, and was in use at least as early as 900 AD.

The word aloof is a related term derived from loof, old English for ""weather gage"" or ""windward direction"", probably from the Dutch word loef, “the weather side of a ship."" Aloof was originally a nautical order to keep the ship's head to the wind, for example to avoid a lee-shore, but it has since taken a figurative meaning of ""at a distance, or reserve suggesting consciousness of superiority.""  It is still in use in German sailors' language as ""LUV."" Note also the wind-related words loft in English and luft in modern German.

Meteorological significance

Leeward and windward refer respectively to what a game stalker would call downwind and upwind. The terms are used by seamen in relation to their ships but also in reference to islands in an archipelago and to the different sides of a single island. In the latter case, the windward side is that side of an island subject to the prevailing wind, and is thus the wetter side (see orographic precipitation). The leeward side is the side protected by the elevation of the island from the prevailing wind, and is typically the drier side of an island. Thus, leeward or windward siting is an important weather and climate factor on oceanic islands.

In the case of an archipelago, windward islands are upwind and leeward islands are the downwind ones.

Other significance

In aviation, downwind refers to a portion of an aircraft's landing pattern. The long side parallel to the runway but flown in the opposite direction is called the downwind leg.

On land, downwind is often used to refer to a situation where a point source of air pollution or a scent moves from a point upwind, along the direction of the wind, to the point of the observer.

Downwind has specific connotations in industrial cities in the English North, where less desirable and less expensive housing was often situated to the leeward of steelworks, blast furnaces, mills, or other sources of intense pollution. Hence in some cities it is used as a generic, slang, pejorative and discriminatory term for less wealthy areas or their inhabitants.

Nautical and naval

Windward and leeward directions are important factors (points of sail) to consider when sailing a sailing ship. Other terms with broadly the same meaning are widely used, particularly upwind and downwind, and many variations using the metaphor of height (""come up"", ""drop down"", ""we're pointing higher than them"", ""head below that mark"", and so on).

The windward vessel is normally the more maneuverable vessel. For this reason, rule 12 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea stipulates that the windward vessel gives way to the leeward vessel. Similarly, a square rigged warship would often try to enter battle from the windward direction (or ""hold the weather gauge""), thus gaining an important tactical advantage over the opposing warship – the warship to windward could choose when to engage and when to withdraw. The opposing warship to leeward could often do little but comply without exposing itself unduly.

This was particularly important once artillery was introduced to naval warfare. The ships heeled away from the wind so that the leeward vessel was exposing part of her bottom to shot. If damaged ""between wind and water"" (i.e., in the exposed section of the hull) she was consequently in danger of sinking when on the other tack, as happened to some ships of the Spanish Armada at the Battle of Gravelines.

What is the opposite of leeward?

Passage:
Gordon MacRae
Gordon MacRae (March 12, 1921 – January 24, 1986)  was an American actor and singer, best known for his appearances in the film versions of two Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, Oklahoma! (1955) and Carousel (1956), and playing Bill Sherman in On Moonlight Bay (1951) and By The Light of the Silvery Moon (1953).

Early life

Born Albert Gordon MacRae in East Orange in Essex County in northeastern New Jersey, MacRae graduated in 1940 from Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts, and he thereafter served as a navigator in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. Prior to this, he attended Nottingham High School in Syracuse, New York.

Career

Winning a contest enabled MacRae to sing at the 1939 New York World's Fair with Harry James' and Les Brown's orchestras.

He made his Broadway debut in 1942, acquiring his first recording contract soon afterwards. Many of his hit recordings were made with Jo Stafford. It was in 1948 that he appeared in his first film, The Big Punch, a drama about boxing. He soon began an on-screen partnership with Doris Day and appeared with her in several films.

In 1950, he starred with Doris Day in ""Tea for Two"" (a reworking of ""No, No, Nanette""), then in 1951, he starred again with Doris Day in On Moonlight Bay, followed by the 1953 sequel By the Light of the Silvery Moon.  That same year, he also starred opposite Kathryn Grayson in the third film version of The Desert Song. This was followed by leading roles in two major films of Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, Oklahoma! (1955) and Carousel (1956), both films opposite Shirley Jones.

On radio, he was the host and lead actor on The Railroad Hour, a half-hour anthology series made up of condensed versions of hit Broadway musicals.  Many of those programs were recorded later in popular studio cast albums: most of these recordings have been reissued on CDs. 

MacRae appeared frequently on television, on such programs as The Martha Raye Show and The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford, both on NBC. On Christmas 1958, MacRae and Ford performed the Christmas hymn ""O Holy Night"".  Earlier in 1958, MacRae guest starred on the short-lived NBC variety series, The Polly Bergen Show.

Thereafter, MacRae appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Dinah Shore Chevy Show,  The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom, and The Bell Telephone Hour. He continued his musical stage career, often performing with his wife, as in a 1964 production of Bells Are Ringing, also performing as Sky Masterson in the popular musical Guys and Dolls, with his wife playing the role of Miss Adeleide, reprising her Broadway role.  In the late 1960s he co-hosted for a week on The Mike Douglas Show. He also toured in summer stock and appeared in nightclubs. In 1967, he replaced Robert Preston in the original Broadway run of the musical I Do! I Do!, starring opposite Carol Lawrence, who had taken over the role from Mary Martin. 

Personal life

He was married to Sheila MacRae from 1941 until 1967;  the couple were the parents of four children: actresses Heather and Meredith MacRae, and sons William Gordon MacRae and Robert Bruce MacRae. Two of the children, Meredith MacRae and Robert Bruce MacRae, predeceased their mother, Sheila.

Gordon MacRae was married, secondly, to Elizabeth Lambert Schrafft on September 25, 1967, and fathered one daughter, Amanda Mercedes MacRae in 1968. They remained married until his death. He was buried at the Wyuka Cemetery in Lincoln, Nebraska.

Passage:
Europa Point
Europa Point (Spanish and Llanito: Punta de Europa or Punta Europa), is the southernmost point of Gibraltar (the Southestmost point of the Iberian Peninsula being Punta de Tarifa 25km southwest of Gibraltar). At the end of the Rock of Gibraltar, the area is flat and occupied by such features as a playing field and a few buildings. On a clear day, views of North Africa can be seen across the Strait of Gibraltar including Ceuta and the Rif Mountains of Morocco; as well as the Bay of Gibraltar and the Spanish towns along its shores. It is accessed from the old town by Europa Road.

There are five notable buildings, Harding's Battery, the Ibrahim-al-Ibrahim Mosque, the Roman Catholic Shrine of Our Lady of Europe, the Europa Point Lighthouse and the Nun's Well. Europa Point is also the location of Gibraltar's only dedicated cricket oval  where the Gibraltar national cricket team play and since 2013 Europa Point has been the location of the Sikorski Memorial.

Europa Point is linked with the Eastern side of the Rock, including Sandy Bay and Catalan Bay, via Dudley Ward Tunnel. The tunnel re-opened in 2010 after eight years closure following a fatal rockfall.

The Government of Gibraltar spent £4.4 million on refurbishing Europa Point in 2011 and it was opened by the then Chief Minister of Gibraltar Peter Caruana. In 2013 an original RML 12.5 inch 38 ton gun was mounted on a custom made replica carriage at Hardings's Battery and the memorial to General Wladislaw Sikorski was relocated here from Sir Herbert Miles Road.

Notable buildings 

Harding's Battery

Europa has been the site of Spanish and Moorish fortifications as well as those constructed by the British which added to the cliffs which were part of Gibraltar's natural defences. Additions included walls, the scarping of the rocks to remove foot and handholds and a large number of batteries supported by a local barracks.  Today, Harding's Battery is central to the land at the end of the point. Built in the 19th century, this battery shows the scale of guns that could fire 800 pound projectiles over a foot in diameter over to the other side of the Straits of Gibraltar. The Europa Sunken Magazine that contained this ammunition is now a visitor centre.

Lighthouse 

The Europa Point Lighthouse was built by Governor Sir Alexander Woodford between 1838 and 1841. It was fully automated in February 1994 and its loom can be seen over a distance of 27 km. It is the southernmost lighthouse for which Trinity House is responsible, and the only one outside the UK.

Gibraltarians refer to it as ""la farola"" when conversing in Llanito.
The Gibraltar Amateur Radio operators transmit from the area of the lighthouse. 

Ibrahim-al-Ibrahim Mosque 

The mosque, also known as the King Fahd bin Abdulaziz al-Saud Mosque or the Mosque of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, is a mosque located at Europa Point. The building was a gift from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and took two years to build at a cost of around £5 million. It was officially inaugurated on 8 August 1997. The mosque complex also contains a school, library, and lecture hall. It is the only purpose-built mosque in Gibraltar to serve the Muslims in the territory who number over 2,000. 

Shrine of Our Lady of Europe 

On 20 August 1462, on St. Bernard of Clairvaux's feastday, the Spaniards under Don Rodrigo Ponce de León, recaptured Gibraltar from the Moors. They found a little mosque at Europa Point and converted it into a Christian shrine in honour of Our Lady as Patroness of Europe, with devout intention of consecrating to God, through Mary, the whole continent, from a place of prayer and worship at its southernmost point.

They built a large chapel at right angles to the mosque's east wall and the whole area became the Shrine of Our Lady of Europe. A statue of the Virgin and Child was installed in this shrine. The statue was quite small, only  in height, carved in wood and polychromed in royal red, blue and gold. The Virgin was seated in a simple chair, with the Child Jesus on her lap. Both were crowned and the Virgin held in her right hand a sceptre with three flowers denoting Love, Truth and Justice. The shrine prospered in fame and popularity, for well over two centuries. Ships passing through the Strait saluted Our Lady as they passed Europa Point and mariners often came ashore with gifts to the shrine. Provisions were made by them for a constant supply of oil so that a light could be kept burning not only in front of the image but also in the tower.

In 1979 Pope John Paul II officially approved the title of Our Lady of Europe as Patroness of Gibraltar, and subsequently, the shrine was restored.

Nun's Well 

Nun's Well is an old underground water store opposite the end of the  Keightley Way Tunnel. The water was used in the nineteenth century to make beer. In 1988 the buildings were repaired in order that it could be used by visitors to Gibraltar.

Passage:
The Matchmaker (1958 film)
The Matchmaker is a 1958 American comedy film directed by Joseph Anthony. The film stars Anthony Perkins, Shirley MacLaine, and Shirley Booth in her final film. The screenplay by John Michael Hayes is based on the 1955 play of the same name by Thornton Wilder. Costumes by Edith Head.

Plot

Set in 1884, the story focuses on Dolly Gallagher Levi, a widow who supports herself by a variety of means, with matchmaking as her primary source of income. Horace Vandergelder, a wealthy but miserly merchant from Yonkers, New York, has hired her to find him a wife, but unbeknownst to him Dolly is determined to fill the position herself. When he expresses his intent to travel to New York City to woo milliner Irene Molloy, Dolly shows him the photograph of a woman she calls Miss Ernestina Simple and tells him the buxom beauty would be a far better choice for him. Horace agrees to have dinner with Ernestina at the Harmonia Gardens after visiting Irene.

Meanwhile, Horace's head clerk Cornelius Hackl convinces his sidekick Barnaby Tucker that they, too, deserve an outing to New York. The two cause cans of tomatoes to explode, spewing their contents about the store, which justifies their closing it for the day and heading to the city.  While there, they come across Irene's hat shop and Cornelius is instantly taken to her. The pair are forced to hide however, when Mr. Vandergelder and Dolly arrive. Though Dolly and Irene cover up for them, Mr. Vandergelder still realizes that Irene is hiding people in her shop (though he doesn't know who) and leaves in disgust. Irene furiously demands that Cornelius and Barnaby repay her by taking her and the shop assistant Minnie out to a fancy restaurant for dinner (Dolly had led her to believe that the men were secretly members of high society).

By total coincidence, Cornelius, Barnaby, Irene, Minnie, Horace, and Dolly all dine at the same restaurant. Horace realizes that Dolly tricked him and that there is no such person as Ernestina Simple. Cornelius worries over how to pay for the meal until a well-meaning diner gives him Mr. Vandergelder's wallet (which the diner believes Cornelius dropped).

A Fine Romance (song)
""A Fine Romance"" is a popular song composed by Jerome Kern with lyrics by Dorothy Fields, published in 1936.

The song was written for the musical film, Swing Time, where it was co-introduced by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Astaire had a major record hit on Brunswick records. However, it was made most famous by Billie Holiday's recording, also done in 1936.

In Hollywood, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald recorded their version of the song in the summer of 1957.  In 1963, Fitzgerald included a solo rendition on her Verve Records album, Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Jerome Kern Songbook, produced by Norman Granz.

In a version sung by Judi Dench it also became the theme song of A Fine Romance, a British television series starring Dench and her husband Michael Williams.

A recording by Lena Horne features in the film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1993). The song also features in the stage musical Priscilla Queen of the Desert – the Musical.

Passage:
Guitarist
A guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar. Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars. Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by singing or playing the harmonica.

Techniques

The guitarist may employ any of several methods for playing the guitar, depending on the type of strings used (either nylon or steel), and including strumming with the fingers or a guitar pick, melodic flatpicking, and finger-picking.

Art

While music is an art form in itself, playing an instrument such as the guitar has long been a popular subject for painters. One of the more famous examples is the painting Degas's Father Listening to Lorenzo Pagans Playing the Guitar by Edgar Degas, which was painted sometime between 1869–72 and is currently owned by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. 

Notable guitarists

Despite perceived tendencies in mainstream music diffusion, to Rock music and electric guitar, notable guitarists arrived from other genres and different variations of the guitar instrument.

Rock , Heavy metal and jazz

Several magazines and websites have compiled what they intend as lists of the greatest guitarists—for example The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time by Rolling Stone magazine, or 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time by Guitar World magazine.

;Rolling Stone: In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine published a list called The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. This list included 100 guitarists whom the magazine editor David Fricke considered the best, with a brief introduction for each of them.  The first in this list is the American guitarist Jimi Hendrix introduced by Pete Townshend, guitarist for The Who, who was, in his turn, ranked at #50 in the list.

In describing the list to readers, Paul MacInnes from British newspaper The Guardian wrote, ""Surprisingly enough for an American magazine, the top 10 is fair jam-packed with Yanks,"" though he also noted three exceptions in the top 10.  The online magazine Blogcritics criticized the list for introducing some  allegedly undeserving guitarists while forgetting some artists the writer considered perhaps more worthy, such as Johnny Marr, Phil Keaggy or John Petrucci. 

In 2011, Rolling Stone updated the list, which this time was chosen by a panel of guitarists and other experts with the top 5 consisting of Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards and Jeff Beck. Artists who had not been included in the previous list were added. Rory Gallagher, for example, was ranked in 57th place.   
The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time is mentioned in many biographies about artists who appear in the list.   

;Guitar World: Guitar World, a monthly music magazine devoted to the guitar, also published their list of 100 greatest guitarists in the book Guitar World Presents the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time from the Pages of Guitar World Magazine.  Different from the Rolling Stone list, which listed guitarists in descending order, Guitar World divided guitarists by music genre—such as ""Lords of Hard Rock"" for hard rock artists or ""Jazzmen"" for jazz players. Despite the appearance in other magazines like Billboard,  this publication by Guitar World was criticized for including no female musicians within its selection.  However, Guitar World recently published a list of ""Eight Amazing Female Acoustic Players,"" including Kaki King, Muriel Anderson and Sharon Isbin. 

;TIME and others: Following the death of Les Paul, TIME website presented their list of 10 greatest artists in electric guitar. As in Rolling Stone magazine's list, Jimi Hendrix was chosen as the greatest guitarist followed by Slash from Guns 'N' Roses, B.B. King, Keith Richards,  Jimmy Page,and Eric Clapton.  Gigwise.com, an online music magazine, also ranks Jimi Hendrix as the greatest guitarist ever, followed by Jimmy Page, B.B. King, Keith Richards and Kirk Hammett. 

Other genres

There are many classical guitarists listed as notable in their respective epochs.

In recent decades, the most ""notable classical and cross genre"" guitarist was Paco de Lucía, one of the first flamenco guitarists to have successfully crossed over into other genres of music such as classical and jazz. Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton, authors of Guitar: Music, History, Players, describe de Lucía as a ""titanic figure in the world of flamenco guitar"",  and Dennis Koster, author of Guitar Atlas, Flamenco, has referred to de Lucía as ""one of history's greatest guitarists."".
Question:
""Who was the lead guitarist of the band """"Guns N' Roses"""" between 1985 and 1996?""
Answer:
Slash (comics)

Secret Fortune
Secret Fortune is a BBC National Lottery game show that was broadcast on BBC One from 12 February 2011 to 29 December 2012. The programme was hosted by Nick Knowles.

Format

A pair of contestants must find the highest sum of money contained in one of 24 numbered envelopes, each containing a randomly assigned sum of money between £100 and £100,000. This is done by correctly answering a series of multiple choice questions.

In the first half of the game, the contestants select four of the envelopes and these are each assigned to one of the four possible answers. In this stage of the game, the computer assigns the envelope containing the highest sum of money to the correct answer. The contestants then eliminate the three answers they believe are wrong. With each elimination, the associated envelope is opened to reveal the sum of money being discarded. The remaining envelope is handed unopened to the contestants to be used in the second half. This continues over six questions until the contestants are left with six.
 
In the second half of the game, the remaining envelopes that the players keep in the first half are assigned to answers, but now the lowest sum of money is assigned to the correct answer and the contestants must identify and eliminate it. One envelope is discarded with each question until the final question becomes a 50/50 choice between two answers. The contestants win the sum of money inside the envelope they do not eliminate.

The twenty-four money amounts are £100, £500, £1,000, £2,000, £3,000, £4,000, £5,000 £6,000, £7,000, £8,000, £9,000, £10,000, £12,000, £14,000, £16,000, £18,000, £20,000, £22,000, £25,000, £30,000, £40,000, £50,000, £75,000, and £100,000.

Passage:
Heel
The heel is the prominence at the posterior end of the foot. It is based on the projection of one bone, the calcaneus or heel bone, behind the articulation of the bones of the lower leg.

Structure

To distribute the compressive forces exerted on the heel during gait, and especially the stance phase when the heel contacts the ground, the sole of the foot is covered by a layer of subcutaneous connective tissue up to 2 cm thick (under the heel).  This tissue has a system of pressure chambers that both acts as a shock absorber and stabilises the sole.  Each of these chambers contains fibrofatty tissue covered by a layer of tough connective tissue made of collagen fibers.  These septa (""walls"") are firmly attached both to the plantar aponeurosis above and the sole's skin below. The sole of the foot is one of the most highly vascularized regions of the body surface, and the dense system of blood vessels further stabilize the septa.
 

The Achilles tendon is the muscle tendon of the triceps surae, a ""three-headed"" group of muscles—the soleus and the two heads of the gastrocnemius.  The main function of the triceps surae is plantar flexion, i.e. to stretch the foot downward.  It is accompanied by a ""fourth head"", the slight plantaris muscle, the long slender tendon of which is also attached to the heel bone but not visible.
 

Function

The compressive forces applied to the foot are distributed along five rays, three medial (side of big toe) and two lateral (side of little toe). The lateral rays stretch over the cuboid bone to the heel bone and the medial rays over the three cuneiform bones and the navicular bone to the ankle bone.  Because the ankle bone is placed over the heel bone, these rays are adjacent near the toes but overriding near the heel, and together they form the arches of the foot that are optimized to distributed compressive forces across an uneven terrain. In this context the heel thus forms the posterior point of support that together with the balls of the large and little toes bear the brunt of the loads. 

Other animals

In the long-footed mammals, both the hoofed species (unguligrade) and the clawed forms which walk on the toes (digitigrade), the heel is well above the ground at the apex of the angular joint known as the hock. In plantigrade species it rests on the ground. In birds, the heel is the backward-pointing joint which is often mistaken as the ""knee"" (the actual knee of birds is hidden under the plumage).
Question:
The heel of the forward foot must contact the ground before the toe of the rear foot leaves it is a rule of which sport?
Answer:
Psycho-analysis of walking
Passage:
Ramses Station
Ramses Railway Station ( Maḥaṭṭat Ramsīs), also called Misr Station ( Maḥaṭṭat Miṣr) is the main railway station of Cairo, Egypt. The name is derived from the Ancient Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II whose statue was erected by Nasser on the square there in 1955.

History

The original railway station was built as the terminal of the first rail link from Alexandria to Cairo in 1856. The current building was erected in 1892 and upgraded in 1955. As of January 2001 it was undergoing a major modernisation. In early 2011, following the Egyptian Uprising, Ramses station was fully upgraded and air conditioned with new marble flooring across the station and the addition of escalators. Some critics believe that the modernisations were too modern and destroyed much of the building's original style. 

Huda Shaarawi, the Egyptian feminist, famously removed her veil here.

Structure

Outside of the station used to be the statue of Ramses II that was relocated to  Memphis, Egypt, 12 mi south of Cairo in the area of Giza on 25 August 2006.

The famous sculpture of Mahmoud Mokhtar, Nahdat Misr (Egypt's Awakening), was originally installed outside the station in 1928, but was removed to its current location near Cairo University in the 1950s.

Facilities in the station include a left luggage office, a post office, ATMs, a pharmacy and a tourist information office. 

Train services

Ramses Station is served by the vast majority of Egyptian National Railways' intercity passenger services.

Connecting services

The railway station has also a connection to Cairo Metro Lines 1 and 2  via the nearby ""Al-Shohadaa/Martyrs"" Station; Cairo Trams, city buses,  microbuses, and Cairo taxis are also available.

","['Ettrick shepherd', 'The ettrick shepherd', 'The Ettrick Shepherd', 'James Hogg']",9732,triviaqa,en,,52ec6c4c5fac20726f788c8aeaa11b705af86d4b244b47e2," Pouchong (; Standard Chinese pronunciation) or light oolong, is a lightly fermented (oxidized) tea, twist shape, with floral notes, and usually not roasted. It is produced mainly in Fujian, China, and in Pinglin Township near Taipei, Taiwan. At its best, Pouchong gives off a floral and melon fragrance and has a rich, mild taste. The most popular kinds of pouchong tea are from the Nankang and Wenshan regions. It has been produced since about 1885, but today very little is grown. The name pouchong comes into the English language from the Chinese name 'pouchong' or 'flower tea' It has a deep green color with tiny grayish white spots, and a delicate fragrance similar to fresh flowers. The taste is not harsh and its sweet flavor has a moisturizing effect. One study found it to have over three times the amount of these compounds relative to black tea, although it was found to have less than green or Oolong teas. The tea has antioxidant activity and antimutagenic properties, and is one of the ten most popular teas in Taiwan. It can be found in the Northgate Mall in Seattle, Washington, which is anchored by Bed Bath Beyond, J.C. Penney, Macy's and Nordstrom. It was the first post-war-type shopping centers in the northern environs of the U.S. Originally known as Northgate Center, the mall was built over part of a cranberry creek. It had been a bogberry development on land that had been part of the Thornton Creek cranberry farm. The mall is now one of three Puget Sound-area malls developed by Allied Stores (parent company of Allied Stores) in the 1990s. The other two malls are the Westfield Seattle and Westfield Los Angeles. The Northgate mall is a shopping mall in the district of north urban Seattle, which was built in the 1950s and 1960s. It opened in April 1950 and housed seventy tenants, including Macy's, Bed Bath and Beyond, and the adjoined 4-story Northgate Building/dental center. It also featured a theatre, which seated over 1300 patrons, and an adjoined medical center/dentists' office. The shopping mall is located in the heart of Seattle's Northgate shopping district, which has a population of over 1300,000 people. It's located in an area known as the ""Puget Sound"" area. Northgate was the first regional shopping center in the United States to be described as a mall. The shopping center was originally anchored by The Bon Marché (renamed Macy's 2005). There were also a J.J. Newberry 5 and 10, Butler Brothers variety store and an A & P Supermarket. The mall is bounded on the north by NE Northgate Way (formerly NE 110th Street), on the west by 1st Avenue NE, on the south by NE 103rd Street, and on the east by 5th Avenue NE. The original mall has itself become the anchor for development of surrounding apartment buildings, retail and light commercial blocks and community spaces, all now part of a more comprehensive plan for growth. In January 2012, Toys ""R"" Us closed which coincided with the end of its lease. The first express bus service in Washington State was launched with the Northgate Health Group in the early 1950s. The Green River Killer murdered Tracy Ann Winston from Northgate Mall on September 12, 1983. The totem pole at the north entrance of the mall was removed in September 2007, and the former location is currently the home to DSW and Bed, Bath and Beyond. In 2006, Simon Properties embarked on an expansion of North Gate Mall, in part because of the city's plan for revitalizing the North Gate neighborhood. The expansion plans included a new outdoor ""urban-village"" on the western end of the Mall facing Interstate 5. This village opened in November 2007. In early 2008, construction began on a 100,000 sqft lifestyle-type addition to the mall. This was completed in early 2008. Anchor stores are Nordstrom, Macy's, J.C. Penney, and Bed Bath & Beyond. The Northgate informal district and North Gate Way were both named after the mall, and both are now named after it. In 2010, Target opened at the mall and later closed after six years due to underperforming sales. In 2012, DSW opened at Northgate and closed six years later due to poor sales. The Mall is now home to the Target Health Group, which also has stores at DSW, Target, and Home Depot. It is also the home of the Target Medical Group, a health care insurance provider. Northgate will be an elevated Link Light Rail station to the west of the mall. It will be the final station on the Northgate Link Extension, scheduled to open in 2021. The mall is home to Macy's, J.C. Penney, DSW, Toys ""R"" Us, Nordstrom, and The Bon Marche. Simon Malls, the largest real estate investment group in the US, owns and operates Northgate Mall. George Marriott Edgar (1880–1951) was a poet, scriptwriter and comedian best known for writing many of the monologues performed by Stanley Holloway, particularly the 'Albert' series. He fathered an illegitimate namesake son, Richard Horatio Edgar Wallace, with widowed actress Mrs Mary Jane ""Polly"" Richards. This son became the famous journalist, novelist, playwright and screenplay writer Edgar Wallace. His first professional successes began after he had been in the cast of The Co-Optimists and worked with Holloway in Hollywood, where he dropped the Marriott appellation for the professional appellation. He was born in Manchester, Lancashire, near Christmas 1847. His parents were Jennifer née Taylor, a native of Dundee, and Richard Horio Marriott Edgar, only son of Alice Marriott (1847–1894), proprietress of the Marriott family theatre troupe. Later all three children chose to take the surname of their mother's husband, Robert Edgar, whom she married in 1856. Richard and Jenny married in March 1875, with Richard being unaware that he had fathered a child with Polly Richards, after a brief sexual encounter. The family moved to London after births and then to Scotland where George was born, before returning to Scotland in 1884. He died in 1885, at the age of 48, and was buried in Kirkcudbright, Scotland. He is survived by his wife, Jennifer, and two children, twins Richard and Jennifer Edgar (b. 1878) and twins Joseph Edgar and Adeline Alice Edgar ( b. 1884). He also had a son, George Edgar, who died in a car crash in 1969. He had a daughter, Jennifer Edgar, in 1881. He also has a son named Richard Edgar, born in 1883, who was also a talented performer, but he later moved to Hollywood and went on to become a professional poet and writer. His son George Edgar died in an accident in 1891, aged 48. He later wrote a book about his experiences in Hollywood called ""The First World War"" The Lion and Albert is one of Marriott Edgar's most popular pieces. The lion of the poem is named ""Wallace"", which was the name of the first African lion to be bred in Britain, living from 1812 until 1838. The monologues were designed to be spoken rhythmically, with piano accompaniment which in many cases was also composed by Edgar. The texts were published by Francis, Day & Hunter during the 1930s in three collections. All were illustrated by John Hassall, many of whose lively images also became classics. Edgar worked for Gainsborough Pictures as a scriptwriter for a number of British films, all comedies except The Ghost Train, between 1936 and 1944. In 1904 in Brentford he married Mildred Williams, and they had a son and a daughter. Edgar died in London in 1947. He is survived by his wife, his son, his daughter and three grandchildren. He was married to his wife Mildred for more than 50 years, until her death in 1998. He died in a nursing home in Hertfordshire, where he lived with his wife and their son. He also had a daughter and a son-in-law, both of whom are still living in the UK. Edgar's compositions were performed by Stanley Holloway and Marriott Edgar.

The Government of Gibraltar spent £4.4 million on refurbishing Europa Point in 2011 and it was opened by the then Chief Minister of Gibraltar Peter Caruana. The mosque, also known as the King Fahd bin Abdulaziz al-Saud Mosque or the Mosque of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, is a mosque located at Europa Point. The Europa Point Lighthouse was built by Governor Sir Alexander Woodford between 1838 and 1841. It is the southernmost lighthouse for which Trinity House is responsible, and the only one outside the UK. The shrine of Our Lady of Europe was built in 1462 by the Spaniards under Don Rodrigo Ponce de León, who recaptured Gibraltar from the Moors. In 1979 Pope John Paul II officially approved the title of Our lady of Europe as Patroness of Gibraltar, and subsequently, the shrine was restored. The well at the end of the point is an old underground water store used in the nineteenth century to make beer. In 1988 the water was repaired in order that it could be used again to be used for drinking water. In 2013 an original RML 12.5 inch 38 ton gun was mounted on a custom made replica carriage at Hardings's Battery and the memorial to General Wladislaw Sikorski was relocated here from Sir Herbert Miles Road. The Gibraltar Amateur Radio operators transmit from the area of the lighthouse. The lighthouse was fully automated in February 1994 and its loom can be seen over a distance of 27 km. It's the only lighthouse in Gibraltar to be owned and operated by Trinity House, which is based in the town of Llanito, on the coast of the South West of the island. The building was a gift from King FahD of Saudi Arabia and took two years to build at a cost of around £5 million. It was officially inaugurated on 8 August 1997 and is the only purpose-built mosque to serve the Muslims in the territory who number over 2,000. A statue of the Virgin and Child was installed in this shrine. The statue was quite small, carved in wood and polychromed in royal red, blue and gold, with the Child Jesus on her lap. The Matchmaker is a 1958 American comedy film directed by Joseph Anthony. The film stars Anthony Perkins, Shirley MacLaine, and Shirley Booth in her final film. The screenplay by John Michael Hayes is based on the 1955 play of the same name by Thornton Wilder. The Broadway musical Hello Dolly! starring Carol Channing and movie of same name with Barbra Streisand and Walter Matthau were both based upon Wilder's play.""A Fine Romance"" is a popular song composed by Jerome Jerome with lyrics by Dorothy Fields, published in 1936. The song was co-introduced by Fredaire and Ginger Rogers on Brunswick, where it had a major record hit on Brunswick Brunswick Brunswick and Brunswick, Brunswick, and Brunswick Avenue, among others. ""Europa Point"" is the southern tip of the British territory of Gibraltar, which is part of the European Union. The Rock of Gibraltar is located in the north-east of the island, at the tip of a peninsula known as the Rock of St. Mathilde. The Strait of Gibraltar separates the Rock from the North Sea, which separates the North African coast from the South African coast. The North Sea is the South Sea, where the South Atlantic Ocean is the largest body of water in the world, and the North Atlantic, which has a population of around 1.5 million. The South Atlantic is the East Atlantic, where most of the population of the UK is based, and includes the Channel Islands, the South Pacific, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is also home to the British Museum, which was founded in 1788 and is located on the south side of the Rock, near the Strait of Gibralter. The British Museum is located at the base of the rock, and is open to the public. It was opened in 1776 and has been the seat of the Royal Family since 1788. It has been home to Queen Elizabeth II since 1778, when she became the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The current Queen is the first woman to hold the office of Prime Minister. The Queen is also the first British monarch to have been born in the 17th century. The last British monarch, Edward VII, was born in 1778 and died in 1787. The first British queen was Queen Victoria, who was born on September 11, 1788, and died on September 14, 1792. A guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar. Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars. The guitarist may employ any of several methods for playing the guitar, depending on the type of strings used (either nylon or steel), and including strumming with the fingers or a guitar pick, melodic flatpicking, and finger-picking. The guitar has long been a popular subject for painters, such as Degas's Father Listening to Lorenzo Pagans Playing the Guitar by Edgar Degas, which was painted sometime between 1869–72 and is currently owned by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The first guitarist in this list is Jim Hendrix, the American guitarist for The Who, who was ranked at #50 in the list by Paul MacInnes. The list includes 100 guitarists whom Rolling Stone magazine considered the best, with a brief introduction of them for each magazine. In 2003, Rolling Stone published a list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time, with The Who's Pete Townshend at the top of the list. The song is the theme song of A Fine Romance, a British television series starring Judi Dench and her husband Michael Williams. It also features in the stage musical Priscilla Queen of the Desert – the Musical. It was made most famous by Billie Holiday's recording, also done in 1936, but was made more famous by Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald's version of the song in the summer of 1957. In 1963, Fitzgerald included a solo rendition on her Verve Records album, EllA Fitzgerald Sings the Jerome Kern Songbook, produced by Norman Granz. A recording by Lena Horne featured in the film The Adventures of Priscillas, Queen of The Desert (1993). The song also features on the soundtrack to the film Priscila, Queen Of The Desert – The Musical, which is based on a play by the same name. It is one of the most popular songs in the UK, with more than 1.5 million plays a year. It has been recorded by more than 100 artists, including Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Marilyn Monroe, Ella Fitzgibbons, and Frank and Nancy Sinatra. In the U.S. it is the second most popular song, after ""I Can’t Go for That"" by The Rolling Stones. The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time is mentioned in many biographies about artists who appear in the list. In 2011, Rolling Stone updated the list, which this time was chosen by a panel of guitarists and other experts with the top 5 consisting of Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards and Jeff Beck. Guitar World recently published a list of ""Eight Amazing Female Acoustic Players,"" including Kaki King, Muriel Anderson and Sharon Isbin. In recent decades, the most ""notable classical and cross genre"" guitarist was Paco de Lucía, one of the first flamenco guitarists to have successfully crossed over into other genres of music such as classical and jazz. The Guardian wrote, ""Surprisingly enough for an American magazine, the top 10 is fair jam-packed with Yanks,"" though he also noted three exceptions in the top ten. The online magazine Blogcritics criticized the list for introducing some allegedly undeserving guitarists while forgetting some artists the writer considered perhaps more worthy, such as Johnny Marr, Phil Keaggy or John Petrucci. The BBC National Lottery game show Secret Fortune was broadcast on BBC One from 12 February 2011 to 29 December 2012. A pair of contestants must find the highest sum of money contained in one of 24 numbered envelopes, each containing a randomly assigned sum ofmoney between £100 and £100,000. This is done by correctly answering a series of multiple choice questions. In the first half of the game, the computer assigns the envelope containing the highestsum of money to the correct answer. The contestants then eliminate the three answers they believe are wrong. The remaining envelope is handed unopened to the contestants to be used in the second half. This continues over six questions until the contestants are left with six answers, but now the remaining envelopes that the players keep are assigned to the answers, and now the answers are chosen. With each elimination, the associated envelope is opened to reveal the sum ofMoney being discarded. The programme was hosted by Nick Knowles, and the programme was aired on BBC1 from 12 Feb 2011 to 28 Dec 2012. The show was directed by David Walliams. owest sum of money is assigned to the correct answer and the contestants must identify and eliminate it. One envelope is discarded with each question until the final question becomes a 50/50 choice between two answers. The twenty-four money amounts are £100, £500, £1,000, £2,000 and £3,000. In 2011, the CBS network commissioned a pilot of Secret Fortune, with Donny Osmond hosting. The show has not been picked up for a full series. In October 2012, the Swiss television channel ""SF"" started the ""Secret Fortune"" with the host Roman Kilchsperger. The name of the game show is ""Top Secret"" Plans for a Swedish version of Secretfortune are in progress. Premiere programme is scheduled for August 2013, on Swedish TV4. In birds, the heel is the actual knee-pointing joint which is often mistaken as ""knee-pointed"" (the actual knee of birds is hidden under the plumigrade). In Inigrade, the ground at the apex of the angular joint known as the hock is well above the ground as well as the heel. The heel is based on the projection of one bone, the calcaneus or heel bone, behind the articulation of the bones of the lower leg. To distribute the compressive forces exerted on the heel during gait, and especially the stance phase when the heel contacts the ground, the sole of the foot is covered by a layer of subcutaneous connective tissue up to 2 cm thick (under the heel). This tissue has a system of pressure chambers that both acts as a shock absorber and stabilises the sole. In the long-footed mammals, both the ho-ofed species, and the clawed forms which walk on the toes (digitigrade), the actual heel is often referred to as ""the hidden"" or ""the heel"" (in birds, this is the hidden plumigrage). In the short-footed species, such as squirrels, the hidden heel is known as ""The heel"" or the ""hidden"" heel (in humans, it is called the ""hock"" or just the ""heel"" The heel bone is attached to the Achilles tendon, which is the muscle tendon of the triceps surae, a ""three-headed"" group of muscles. It is accompanied by a ""fourth head"", the slight plantaris muscle, the long slender tendon of which is also attach to the heel bone but not visible. Because the ankle bone is placed over the heel, these rays are adjacent near the toes and together they form the arches of the feet that are optimized to distributed forces across terrain. Ramses Railway Station is the main railway station of Cairo, Egypt. The name is derived from the Ancient Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II whose statue was erected by Nasser on the square there in 1955. The original railway station was built as the terminal of the first rail link from Alexandria to Cairo in 1856. As of January 2001 it was undergoing a major modernisation. In early 2011, following the Egyptian Uprising, Ramses station was fully upgraded and air conditioned with new marble flooring across the station and the addition of escalators. Some critics believe that the modernisations were too modern and destroyed much of the building's original style.Facilities in the station include a left luggage office, a post office, ATMs, a pharmacy and a tourist information office. The famous sculpture of Mahmoud Mokhtar, Nahdat Misr (Egypt's Awakening), was originally installed outside the station in 1928, but was removed to its current location near Cairo University in the 1950s. The station is served by the vast majority of Egyptian National Railways' intercity passenger services. Cairo Trams, city buses,  microbuses, and Cairo taxis are also available. The railway station has also a connection to Cairo Metro Lines 1 and 2 via the nearby ""Al-Shohadaa/Martyrs"" Station."

Albert Einstein named Person of the Century by Time
Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century is a compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people, published in Time magazine in 1999.
The idea for such a list started on February 1, 1998, with a debate at a symposium at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. The panel participants were former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, former New York governor Mario Cuomo, then-Stanford Provost Dr. Condoleezza Rice, publisher Irving Kristol, and Time managing editor Walter Isaacson.
The final list was published on June 14, 1999, in a special issue titled ""TIME 100: Heroes & Icons of the 20th Century"".
In a separate issue on December 31, 1999, Time recognized Albert Einstein as the Person of the Century.
Source: Wikipedia Added by: Kevin Rogers
Albert Einstein, whose theories laid the groundwork for many modern technologies including nuclear weapons, has been named ""person of the century"" by Time magazine.
Time called him a ""genius, political refugee, humanitarian, locksmith of the mysteries of the atom and the Universe"".
""In a century that will be remembered foremost for its science and technology ... one person clearly stands out as both the greatest mind and paramount icon of our age.
""The kindly, absent-minded professor whose wild halo of hair, piercing eyes, engaging humanity and extraordinary brilliance made his face a symbol and his name a synonym for genius, Albert Einstein,"" the magazine said.
It described him as ""the century's greatest thinker, as an immigrant who fled from oppression to freedom and as a political idealist, who best embodies what historians will regard as significant about the 20th Century.""
""The world has changed far more in the past 100 years than in any other century in history. The reason is ... technologies that flowed directly from advances in basic science,"" theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking wrote in a Time essay.
""Clearly, no scientist better represents those advances than Albert Einstein.""
Time's runners-up for person of the century were US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who it said represented the triumph of freedom and democracy over fascism and communism, and Mahatma Gandhi, who symbolised individuals struggling for their rights. The issue is out on Monday.
The previous issue named the founder of online bookstore Amazon, Jeff Bezos, ""man of the year"".

Audi and Volvo - Latin origin of the car company names ...
Audi and Volvo - Latin origin of the car company names - High Names
03.20.13 Posted in Naming blog by christa
Let’s get back to the car business. We know a lot of the car companies are named after their founders – the trend was spread worldwide from the earliest electric automobiles. These include Ford (after Henry Ford), Peugeot (after the Peugeot family), also later Bentley (after Walter Owen Bentley), Porsche (after Ferdinand Porsche). The trend is also present in Asia by car manufacturers like Toyota (after Kiichiro Toyoda) and Honda (after Soichiro Honda).
However, there are still original company names between the world-wide known brands in the car industry. The naming strategy is often so unique that they cannot be put in categories. But Audi and Volvo can. Can you guess what the connection between those two famous car companies is in terms of naming? Latin.
Volvo – on the different car company names
Despite that Volvo is a Swedish company the founders didn’t name the car Viking or Nordic or anything like that. They decided on the Latin word volvere, meaning to roll. It seems a logical word choice since the purpose of working on a Swedish car project was to build cars that could withstand the cold Scandinavian weather and uneven roads – basically a car that rolls. What they did is only conjugate the verb volvere in first person (because unlike in English many other languages use similar but still different words when saying I roll, you roll, etc) and voilà – you have Volvo. It’s like the car speaks to you – I roll.
Audi – on the translated car company names
The reason for naming the famous car company Audi isn’t that spontaneous compared to Volvo. The truth is that the founder August Horch (and no the AU in Audi doesn’t come from the first two letters of the founder’s name) had originally founded another car company named August Horch & Co. This happened in 1904 when the German engineer had quit working for Karl Benz. However, after some problems in the company, in 1909 Horch founded a second company – but his family name could not be used again as a name for the company because he didn’t have the rights on the company name. The story says that one of his business partners’ son came up with the name Audi. But this wasn’t a random Latin word that simply starts with the letter A (as you may know by now from our blog posts having a company name that starts with A is great because you get listed early in alphabetically ordered lists). If you speak German you’ll know that horch comes from the infinitive form of horchen and actually has a meaning – to listen (carefully). Now, can you guess what the Latin translation of horchen is? It’s audire – a verb that when conjugated in the same form as horch, becomes audi. The name seemed logical since August Horch could no longer use his own name. And a little more than 100 years later Audi is still one of the most popular names in the car industry.

Passage:
Farthing (British coin)
The British farthing (¼d) coin, from ""fourthing"", was a unit of currency of one quarter of a penny, or one nine hundred and sixtieth of a pound sterling. It was minted in bronze, and replaced the earlier copper farthings. It was used during the reign of six monarchs: Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II, ceasing to be legal tender in 1960. It featured two different designs on its reverse during its one hundred years in circulation: from 1860 until 1936, the image of Britannia; and from 1937 onwards, the image of a wren. Like all British coinage, it bore the portrait of the monarch on the obverse. 

Before Decimal Day in 1971, there were two hundred and forty pence in one pound sterling. There were four farthings in a penny, twelve pence made a shilling, and twenty shillings made a pound. Values less than a pound were usually written in terms of shillings and pence, e.g. three shillings and six pence (3/6), pronounced ""three and six"" or ""three and sixpence"". Values of less than a shilling were simply written in terms of pence, e.g. 8d, pronounced ""eightpence"". A price with a farthing in it would be written like this: (19/11¼), pronounced ""nineteen and elevenpence farthing"".

As of 2014, the purchasing power of a farthing in 1960 (at its demise) ranged between 2p and 7p (in 2014 GB Pound values). 

Design 

The original reverse of the coin, designed by Leonard Charles Wyon, is a seated Britannia, holding a trident, with the word  above. Issues before 1895 also feature a lighthouse to Britannia's left and a ship to her right. Various minor adjustments to the level of the sea depicted around Britannia, and the angle of her trident were also made over the years. Some issues feature toothed edges, while others feature beading.

Over the years, seven different obverses were used. Edward VII, George V, George VI and Elizabeth II each had a single obverse for farthings produced during their respective reigns. Over the long reign of Queen Victoria two different obverses were used, and the short reign of Edward VIII meant that no farthings bearing his likeness were ever issued.

The farthing was first issued with the so-called ""bun head"", or ""draped bust"" of Queen Victoria on the obverse. The inscription around the bust read  (abbreviated Latin: Victoria by the grace of God queen of Britain defender of the faith). This was replaced in 1895 by the ""old head"", or ""veiled bust"". The inscription on these coins read  (Victoria by the grace of God queen of Britain defender of the faith empress of India).

Coins issued during the reign of Edward VII feature his likeness and bear the inscription  (Edward VII by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India). Similarly, those issued during the reign of George V feature his likeness and bear the inscription  (George V by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India).

A farthing of King Edward VIII (1936) does exist, dated 1937, but technically it is a pattern coin i.e. one produced for official approval, which it would probably have been due to receive about the time that the King abdicated. The obverse shows a left-facing portrait of the king (who considered this to be his best side, and consequently broke the tradition of alternating the direction in which the monarch faces on coins — some viewed this as indicating bad luck for the reign); the inscription on the obverse is  (Edward VIII by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India).

The pattern coin of Edward VIII and regular-issue farthings of George VI and Elizabeth II feature a redesigned reverse displaying the wren, one of Britain's smallest birds.

George VI issue coins feature the inscription  (George VI by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith emperor of India) before 1949, and  (George VI by the grace of God king of all Britain defender of the faith) thereafter. Unlike the penny, farthings were minted throughout the early reign of Elizabeth II, bearing the inscription  (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen of all Britain defender of the faith) in 1953, and  (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen defender of the faith) thereafter.

Passage:
Muscovado
Muscovado, called Khaand in Hindi language, is a type of partially refined to unrefined brown sugar with a strong molasses content and flavour. It is technically considered either a non-centrifugal cane sugar or a centrifuged, partially refined sugar according to the process used by the manufacturer.  

Confusion has been created over the meaning of the term muscovado sugar, and as there is no legal definition or Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), different manufacturers are free to use the term loosely to describe any dark, molasses-rich sugar they produce. The term was originally coined in 17th- to 18th-century English to designate a poorly refined sugar that had retained too high a content of molasses and was deemed low quality.   

In a modern context muscovado is used to define sugar made from the juice of sugar cane by evaporation until crystallization occurs. This solution of crystals and mother liquor (molasses) is called massecuite. The massecuite is set into moulds directly, granulated in cooling pans by shear action (either the traditional manual method or through use of a spray drier) or sent to a centrifuge to separate a crystal-rich mush that is drained of its molasses in a vessel under gravity.    

Currently there are two localities still producing a commercial sugar termed muscovado, Mauritius and the Philippines. Muscovado from Mauritius is produced by centrifuged massecuite left to drain naturally of its molasses, whilst Filipino muscovado may be generated from any of the three methods. 

There is some effort being made to clean up the terminology of sugars produced over the world as there are various synonyms used to describe unrefined through poorly refined to partially refined sugars with high molasses content and a dark colour made from sugar cane, such as panela (Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Argentina), rapadura (Brazil), chancaca (Chile, Peru, Bolivia), piloncillo (Mexico), muscovado (Philippines, Mauritius), panocha (Philippines), raspadura (Panama), kokuto (Japan), jaggery (India, South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria) and papelon (Venezuela) 

History

Also known as ""Barbados sugar"", ""molasses sugar"" or ""moist sugar"", muscovado sugar is an English corruption of the Spanish azúcar mascabado or the Portuguese açúcar mascavado,  meaning sugar of the lowest quality or lowest value.  The name and meaning is tied to the state of sugar production and markets of the late 18th to earliest 19th century, when sugar that had been less refined was considered an inferior product by the industry; thus muscovado meant literally a low quality sugar that was poorly drained of its molasses.

Throughout the British Empire sugars that had been refined enough to lose most of their molasses content were termed raw and deemed higher quality, while most poor quality sugars with a high molasses content were usually referred to as muscovado, though the term ""brown sugar"" was occasionally used interchangeably.  Sugar in the 19th century was produced through a variety of methods ranging from traditional, outdated practices, through to more modern, industrialized methods which incorporated the latest technology, such as vacuum pans and centrifuges.   Sugar imported into Britain from its colonies (the West Indies, Mauritius and India) or from foreign markets (Cuba, Java, Brazil, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Réunion, Louisiana or the French West Indies) was brought to port in a variety of purities that could be sold either as raw sugar direct to market or as muscovado bound for a British refinery such as those in Glasgow or London. Sugar refinement had reached a zenith in Britain (and also, incidentally, in Louisiana), so expensive industrial equipment did not need to be installed in the colonies. In the early 19th century muscovado sugar was being produced in Mauritius from centrifuges and sent to conical moulds, in which molasses dripped from the sugar crystals under gravity. At the same time muscovado was being produced in the West Indies by primitive shearing action (feet stamping into barrels) on clarified, evaporated cane juice. Both of these are examples of the divergent production methods used to make muscovado sugar.

Uses

Muscovado is very dark brown and slightly coarser and stickier than most brown sugars. Muscovado takes its flavor and color from its source, sugarcane juice. It offers good resistance to high temperatures and has a reasonably long shelf life. It is commonly used in baking recipes and making rum. Muscovado sugar can be used in most recipes where brown sugar is called for, by slightly reducing the liquid content of the recipe. 

Muscovado sugar  has 11 calories/ 4 grams (approx. 1 tsp). When produced under regulated conditions, it is nutritionally richer than other brown sugars or refined sugar, and retains most of the natural minerals inherent in sugarcane juice, as shown in this chart: 

Mineral content of muscovado sugar (per 100 g):
* Total mineral salts 740 mg max.
* Phosphorus (P) 3.9 mg max.
* Calcium (Ca) 85 mg max.
* Magnesium (Mg) 23 mg max.
* Potassium (K) 100 mg max.
* Iron (Fe) 1.3 mg max.

This unrefined sugar can be used in coffee and other beverages, and was one of the most prominent export commodities of the Philippines, especially from the Negros region from the 19th century until the late 1970s.  The production of muscovado sugar in the Philippines, Barbados, and elsewhere had experienced a long period of decline when large mills took over sugar production from small farmers with small mills until consumer interest in healthy and organic foods revived interest in muscovado sugar, creating a new market for muscovado sugar production from small mills.

Cock Robin
""Who Killed Cock Robin"" is an English nursery rhyme, which has been much used as a murder archetype in world culture. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 494.

Lyrics

The earliest record of the rhyme is in Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book, published c. 1744, which noted only the first four verses. The extended version given below was not printed until c. 1770.I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 130–3.

with my little dish,
I caught his blood.

Who'll make the shroud?

I, said the Dove,
I mourn for my love,
I'll be chief mourner.

Who'll carry the coffin?
I, said the Kite,
if it's not through the night,
I'll carry the coffin.

Who'll bear the pall?
We, said the Wren,
both the cock and the hen,
We'll bear the pall.

Who'll sing a psalm?
I, said the Thrush,
as she sat on a bush,
I'll sing a psalm.

Who'll toll the bell?
I said the Bull,
because I can pull,
I'll toll the bell.

All the birds of the air
fell a-sighing and a-sobbing,
when they heard the bell toll
for poor Cock Robin.

The rhyme has been often reprinted with illustrations, as suitable reading material for small children. The rhyme also has an alternative ending, in which the sparrow who killed cock robin is hanged for his crime.  Several early versions picture a stocky, strong-billed bullfinch tolling the bell, which may have been the original intention of the rhyme. 

Origin and meaning

Although the song was not recorded until the mid-eighteenth century,  there is some evidence that it might be much older. The death of a robin by an arrow is depicted in a 15th-century stained glass window at Buckland Rectory, Gloucestershire,  and the rhyme is similar to a story, Phyllyp Sparowe, written by John Skelton about 1508. The use of the rhyme 'owl' with 'shovel', could suggest that it was originally used in older middle English pronunciation. Versions of the story appear to exist in other countries, including Germany.

A number of theories have been advanced to explain the meaning of the rhyme:
* According to Celtic calendar traditions, Lugh is the sun god who dies as the nights get longer after the summer solstice; a traditional feast in his honour was held on Lughnasadh or ""Lammas"" day on the first of August, a day marked in the old Celtic pictographic calendar with a bow-and-arrow shape. As Lugh was the primary god representing the red sun, his name in common parlance would have been ""Coch Rhi Ben"" anglicised to ""Cock Robin"" – a leftover from the belief that souls became birds after death. This idea is still sustained in the old folk song ""Who Killed Cock Robin"" in which the sparrow kills him with ""my bow and arrow"", the sparrow here representing Bran, the tanist incarnation or opposite of Lugh – the god of winter. (Via www.lablit.com/article/341)
* The rhyme records a mythological event, such as the death of the god Balder from Norse mythology, or the ritual sacrifice of a king figure, as proposed by early folklorists as in the 'Cutty Wren' theory of a 'pagan survival'.  
* It is a parody of the death of King William II, who was killed by an arrow while hunting in the New Forest (Hampshire) in 1100, and who was known as William Rufus, meaning ""red"". 
* The rhyme is connected with the fall of Robert Walpole's government in 1742, since Robin is a diminutive form of Robert and the first printing is close to the time of the events mentioned.

All of these theories are based on perceived similarities in the text to legendary or historical events, or on the similarities of names. Peter Opie pointed out that an existing rhyme could have been adapted to fit the circumstances of political events in the eighteenth century.

The theme of Cock Robin's death as well as the poem's distinctive cadence have become archetypes, much used in literary fiction and other works of art, from poems, to murder mysteries, to cartoons.

Passage:
Canal Turn
The Canal Turn is a fence on Aintree Racecourse's National Course and thus is jumped during the Grand National steeplechase which is held annually at the racecourse, located near Liverpool, England. Named for the Leeds & Liverpool Canal which passes alongside the racecourse at this point, it is jumped twice during the race, as the eighth and 24th fences.

The fence is notable for the sharp left turn that the runners have to take as soon as they have negotiated the fence. The turn is almost 90 degrees and it is not uncommon for jockeys to become unbalanced as they change course; unseatings and falls are common. Seven equine fatalities have been recorded at the Canal Turn in Grand Nationals since the race was first run officially in 1839; the most recent death was that of The Last Fling in 2002.

The Canal Turn has been the scene of a number of incidents that have had a major impact upon the outcome of the Grand National. In 1928, the favourite and top-weight Easter Hero refused at the ditch which at the time preceded the fence (this was filled in following the race). This refusal took out 20 horses. By the end of the first circuit only six horses remained in the field. By the final fence just two remained. Billy Barton fell at the last, leaving the 100/1 outsider Tipperary Tim to finish alone. Billy Barton was, however, remounted to pick up the second-place prize money.

In the 2001 Grand National the riderless Paddy's Return ran in front of the field as they approached the fence. This caused a number of horses to be stopped in their tracks or brought down. In total nine horses in the field were taken out of the race at the Canal Turn, including Amberleigh House, who went on to win the National in 2004. On the final lap Paddy's Return again ran across the fence, but this time Red Marauder, the eventual winner, and Smarty, who eventually took second, avoided the loose horse.

The 2015 Grand National saw the fence bypassed for the first time on the final lap as vets treated Balthazar King, who was injured in a fall on the first lap.

Number of fallers

This table documents the number of runners which fell in recent Grand Nationals at the Canal Turn, including those who unseated riders or were brought down, but not those who were pulled up or refused at the fence:

* 1993 race void.
† Fence was only jumped once in 2015.

B&Q
B&Q plc, originally known as Block & Quayle, is a British multinational DIY and home improvement retailing company with headquarters in Eastleigh, England, United Kingdom. Founded by Richard Block & David Quayle in 1969, it is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingfisher plc. 

B&Q currently has stores in mainland China, Ireland and Taiwan, as well as the United Kingdom. It is the largest DIY retail chain in China and the United Kingdom. It is the second largest in Europe, and the fourth largest in the world (behind the Home Depot, Lowe's & OBI). 

History

1969 to 2000

B&Q was founded in March 1969 in Southampton, England, by Richard Block & David Quayle. The first store opened in the Southampton suburb of Portswood,  and was originally called Block & Quayle, soon shortened to B&Q.  The chain quickly expanded, and by 1979 there were 26 stores across the United Kingdom, by which time the first of the co-founders had left the business: Block left in 1976 & Quayle in 1982. 

B&Q grew rapidly through a combination of mergers, acquisitions and expansions. In 1980, B&Q bought the Hampshire-based company Dodge City, and was itself acquired by the F. W. Woolworth Company. 
F. W. Woolworth's United Kingdom subsidiary (Woolworth's Ltd.) and B&Q were bought two years later by Paternoster, now known as Kingfisher plc and still B&Q's parent company.  In the late 1980s, B&Q purchased Timberland DIY, based in the North East.

B&Q developed two new trading formats: HomeCentres, retailing furniture, bathrooms, soft furniture, flooring and lighting; and AutoCentres, being similar to a Halfords, the first launch taking place at Cribbs Causeway, Bristol, in the late 1980s. The concept being to have a HomeCentre, AutoCentre and DIY Superstore with one communal car park. The forays into these new markets were relatively short lived, and the various sites were sold on a couple of years later. The AutoCentres becoming in the main 'Charlie Browns', the HomeCentres being sold off individually.

In the mid–1990s, B&Q opened a new format of store known as the Depot (later changed to B&Q Depot),  a forerunner of a new class of store known as the B&Q Warehouse. The company also began to expand outside the United Kingdom. 

In 1995, it co-operated with parent company Kingfisher plc to open its first overseas subsidiary in Taiwan,  and in January 1996, the first overseas large home improvement center in Taoyuan City, Taiwan. In September 1998, it acquired NOMI, Poland's leading chain of DIY stores,  and later that year merged with France's Castorama.  The following year, B&Q opened a store in Shanghai,  and acquired the British hardware company Screwfix.

2000 to present

B&Q opened its first store in Hong Kong on 1 June 2007,  but was scheduled to close it on 13 September 2009.   In December 2007, Kingfisher sold its 50 per cent stake in B&Q Taiwan to its joint venture partner. The $106.5 million (£52 million) proceeds were used to reduce debt. 

In March 2009, B&Q closed 22 of its then 63 stores in China, blaming the housing slump.  In May 2011, B&Q agreed to acquire 31 stores in the United Kingdom, from the administrators of Focus DIY for £23M.   During 2011, B&Q opened a new regional distribution centre, at G.Park in Swindon. 

On 31 January 2013, B&Q Ireland Ltd. filed for examinership in the Irish courts and PWC Ireland was appointed examiner.   B&Q Ireland stores will continue to trade as normal for the next 100 days until a suitable buyer is found or alternative financing arrangements can be made. Gift vouchers will continue to be honoured in stores and its 700 staff will continue to be paid.  It is proposed to close two of the nine Irish stores – in Waterford and Athlone.  B&Q Ireland had made a loss in each of the preceding six years. 

Criticism

In June 2001, in Poole, Dorset, 69–year–old customer Pamela Jean Hinchliffe was fatally crushed by a forklift at the firm's Fleetsbridge store. In June 2004, B&Q were found guilty of causing death, and the following month they received a fine of £550,000. However, in September 2005, their legal costs were reduced on appeal. 

In November 2002, Damian Nicholls, the forklift driver, was prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service, at Winchester Crown Court. On 16 June 2001, the court was told that Nicholls had hit some pallets, and a colleague commented that he would ""end up killing someone"". He was acquitted of manslaughter, and of causing death by dangerous driving. However, in October 2005, Nicholls' fine was reduced, again on appeal.

Stores

By 2000, B&Q had 51 of its larger Warehouse stores; this had doubled by 2003. By 3 May 2014, B&Q in the United Kingdom had 359 stores, and 20,887 employees.  In Ireland B&Q operate 9 individual stores. 
Its 2004/2005 turnover was £4.1 billion and profit £400.5 million, 
compared to published figures putting turnover at £3.9 billion and profit at £162.9 million for year ending February 2007. 

In March 2015, Kingfisher said it would close 60 B&Q stores, in the United Kingdom & Ireland over the next two years. It would also close a few loss making stores in Europe. It also said that B&Q UK & Ireland could adequately meet local customer needs, from fewer stores, and some stores should be smaller.

How did the planet Pluto get its name? | Reference.com

How did the planet Pluto get its name?
A:
Quick Answer
Following the tradition of naming planets after ancient Roman gods, Pluto derives its name from the Roman god of the underworld. The Lowell Observatory named the planet after receiving the suggestion from 11-year-old Venetia Burney of Oxford, England. Pluto officially received its name on March 24, 1930.
Full Answer
The Lowell Observatory received over 1,000 suggested names for the planet. Burney initially suggested the name to her grandfather, who passed the suggestion along to an astronomer. The astronomer,  Herbert Hall Turner, passed the name on to astronomers at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz. The name Pluto was selected unanimously from a short list, which also included the suggested names Minerva and Cronus.
Pluto's moons are named after figures associated with the god Pluto. Charon, the first discovered of Pluto's moons, is named after the boatman of the Roman underworld who ferries the souls of the dead across the river to the underworld. Discovered decades later, the moons Nix and Hydra are named after Charon's mother and the multi-head guardian of the underworld, respectively. Subsequently discovered moons are named after Kerberos, a three-headed dog from Greek mythology, and Styx, the name of the river across which Charon ferries souls to the underworld.
While Pluto is the generally accepted name of the planet, some languages use the name of underworld figures from different traditions. Some East Asian languages call the planet Meiosei. In Hindi the planet is called Yama, while in Maori the planet is referred to as Whiro.
Question:
Where did Pluto, discovered in 1930 (and designated a planet at the time), get its name?

Passage:
Richard Poole (character)
Detective Inspector Richard Poole is a character in the crime drama television series Death in Paradise, portrayed by Ben Miller.

A British inspector assigned to Saint Marie to investigate the previous inspector's murder, Poole was instructed to remain on the island as the new police detective. Despite his distaste for the island and inexperience with tropical weather - to the point where he continued to wear his old suits - he often showed a useful knack for making deductive leaps based on minimal information and random events, and favoured making arrests by addressing all the suspects at once before identifying the killer. In series 2 he grew slightly more relaxed. He recommended Fidel for the sergeant's exam. Poole briefly returned to London, but in spite of his distaste for Saint Marie, he chose to return. Richard was murdered in the first episode of Series 3, at a Cambridge university reunion, by Helen Reid, when he threatened to expose her identity theft, and was replaced by DI Humphrey Goodman.

Poole is an ""English eccentric with a hatred for island life"".  According to Michael Hogan, Poole ""harrumphs around Hugh Grant-ishly in his uptight Brit suit and carries a briefcase, endlessly dabbing at his forehead with a hankie."" Hogan goes on to argue that Poole is a ""bland blend of several dozen ""quirky"" screen sleuths: a bit of Morse here, a dash of Columbo there, a pinch of Precious Ramotswe and a lug of Jonathan Creek to taste.""

The Wise Little Hen
The Wise Little Hen is a Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies cartoon, based on the fairy tale The Little Red Hen. This cartoon marked the debut of Donald Duck, dancing to the Sailor's Hornpipe. Donald and his friend Peter Pig try to avoid work by faking stomach aches until Mrs. Hen teaches them the value of labor. This cartoon was released on June 9, 1934. It was animated by Art Babbitt, Dick Huemer, Clyde Geronimi, Louie Schmitt, and Frenchy de Tremaudan (with assistance from a group of junior animators headed by Ben Sharpsteen)  and directed by Wilfred Jackson.  It was also adapted as a Sunday comic strip by Ted Osborne and Al Taliaferro. 

Plot

The Wise Little Hen of the title is looking for someone to help her plant her corn. Peter Pig and Donald Duck both feign belly aches to get out of the chore. So, with help from her chicks, she plants it herself. Harvest time comes; again, Peter and Donald claim belly aches, but the hen sees through this. She cooks up a variety of corn dishes, and heads over to Peter and Donald to help her eat them, but before she can open her mouth, they already fake their belly aches. Once she asks, they are miraculously ""cured"" but all she gives them is castor oil, to teach them a lesson. As the hen eats the corn herself, Peter and Donald, with nothing but an appetite, repent with all their might by kicking each other.

Cast

Bingo (folk song)
""Bingo"", also known as ""Bingo Was His Name-O"", ""There Was a Farmer Who Had a Dog"", and  ""C'era un contadino che aveva un cagnolino di nome Bingolino"" in Italy, is an English language children's song of obscure origin. Additional verses are sung by omitting the first letter sung in the previous verse and clapping instead of actually saying the word. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 589. 

Lyrics

The contemporary version generally goes as follows: 

There was a farmer, had a dog,
and Bingo was his name-o.

Earlier forms

The earliest reference to any form of the song is from the title of a piece of sheet music published in 1780, which attributed the song to William Swords, an actor at the Haymarket Theatre of London.   Early versions of the song were variously titled ""The Farmer's Dog Leapt o'er the Stile"", ""A Franklyn's Dogge"", or ""Little Bingo"".

An early transcription of the song (without a title) dates from the 1785 songbook ""The Humming Bird"",  and reads: This is how most people know the traditional children's song:

The farmer's dog leapt over the stile,
his name was little Bingo,
the farmer's dog leapt over the stile,
his name was little Bingo.
B with an I — I with an N,
N with a G — G with an O;
his name was little Bingo:
B—I—N—G—O!
His name was little Bingo.

The farmer loved a cup of good ale,
he called it rare good stingo,
the farmer loved a cup of good ale,
he called it rare good stingo.
S—T with an I — I with an N,
N with a G — G with an O;
He called it rare good stingo:
S—T—I—N—G—O!
He called it rare good stingo

And is this not a sweet little song?
I think it is —— by jingo.
And is this not a sweet little song?
I think it is —— by jingo.
J with an I — I with an N,
N with a G — G with an O;
I think it is —— by jingo:
J—I—N—G—O!
I think it is —— by jingo.

A similar transcription exists from 1840, as part of The Ingoldsby Legends, the transcribing of which is credited in part to a ""Mr. Simpkinson from Bath"". This version drops several of the repeated lines found in the 1785 version and the transcription uses more archaic spelling and the first lines read ""A franklyn's dogge"" rather than ""The farmer's dog"".  A version similar to the Ingoldsby one (with some spelling variations) was also noted from 1888. 

The presence of the song in the United States was noted by Robert M. Charlton in 1842.  English folklorist Alice Bertha Gomme recorded eight forms in 1894. Highly-differing versions were recorded in Monton, Shropshire, Liphook and Wakefield, Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Derbyshire and Enborne. All of these versions were associated with children's games, the rules differing by locality.  Early versions of ""Bingo"" were also noted as adult drinking songs.

Variations on the lyrics refer to the dog variously as belonging to a miller or a shepherd, and/or named ""Bango"" or ""Pinto"". In some variants, variations on the following third stanza are added:

The farmer loved a pretty young lass, 
and gave her a wedding-ring-o.
R with an I — I with an N,
N with a G — G with an O;
(etc.)

This stanza is placed before or substituted for the stanza starting with ""And is this not a sweet little song?""

Versions that are variations on the early version of ""Bingo"" have been recorded in classical arrangements by Frederick Ranalow (1925), John Langstaff (1952), and Richard Lewis (1960). Under the title ""Little Bingo"", a variation on the early version was recorded twice by folk singer Alan Mills, on Animals, Vol. 1 (1956) and on 14 Numbers, Letters, and Animal Songs (1972).

The song should not be confused with the 1961 UK hit pop song ""Bingo, Bingo (I'm In Love)"" by Dave Carey, which originated as a jingle for pirate station Radio Luxembourg.

Passage:
I'll Never Fall in Love Again
""I'll Never Fall in Love Again"" is a popular song by the composer Burt Bacharach and the lyricist Hal David. Originally written for the 1968 musical Promises, Promises, the song's narrator ruminates on the various troubles that falling in love brings. The song charted at #93 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 during the summer of 1969.  The song was nominated for Song of the Year in the 1969 Grammy awards.

In January 1970, the song was a number six hit on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and a number-one hit for three weeks on the Easy Listening chart for Dionne Warwick.  Warwick's version, arranged and produced by Bacharach and recorded in 1969 with the session musician Gary Chester on drums, also reached number three on the Canadian Chart and crossed over into the Top 20 R&B Chart and became an international million seller. It also spent four weeks at number one on the Canadian Adult Contemporary chart.  Warwick's album of the same name containing the single won a 1971 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance-Female.

The song has charted with various other artists. Bobbie Gentry's reached number one on the UK Singles Chart for a single week in October 1969.  Ella Fitzgerald's became a minor hit in September 1969 and charted briefly. It was also the best-charting single in a cover version for the Scottish band Deacon Blue, peaking at number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1990.

Passage:
Risotto
Risotto ( or) is a northern Italian rice dish cooked in a broth to a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or vegetables. Many types of risotto contain butter, wine, and onion. It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy.

Risotto in Italy is normally a primo (first course), served on its own before the main course, but risotto alla milanese,, is often served together with ossobuco alla milanese.

Rice varieties

A high-starch (amylopectin), low-amylose round medium- or short- grain white rice is usually used for making risotto. Such rices have the ability to absorb liquids and to release starch and so they are stickier than the long grain varieties. The principal varieties used in Italy are Arborio, Baldo, Carnaroli, Maratelli, Padano, Roma, and Vialone Nano.  Carnaroli, Maratelli (historical Italian variety) and Vialone Nano are considered to be the best (and most expensive) varieties, with different users preferring one over another. They have slightly different properties. For example, Carnaroli is less likely than Vialone Nano to get overcooked, but the latter, being smaller, cooks faster and absorbs condiments better. Other varieties like Roma, Baldo, Ribe and Originario may be used but will not have the creaminess of the traditional dish. These varieties are considered better for soups and other non-risotto rice dishes and for making sweet rice desserts. Rice designations of Superfino, Semifino and Fino refer to the size and shape (specifically the length and the narrowness) of the grains, and not the quality.

Basic preparation

There are many different risotto recipes with different ingredients, but they are all based on rice of an appropriate variety, cooked in a standard procedure.

The rice is first cooked briefly in a soffritto of onion and, butter or olive oil, to coat each grain in a film of fat, called tostatura; white or red wine is added and must be absorbed by the grains. When it has evaporated, then the heat is raised to medium high, and very hot stock is gradually added in small amounts, while the concoction is stirred gently, almost constantly: stirring loosens the starch molecules from the outside of the rice grains into the surrounding liquid, creating a smooth creamy-textured liquid. At that point, the pot is taken off the heat for the mantecatura (the point when diced cold butter is vigorously stirred in), to make the texture as creamy and smooth as possible. It may be removed from the heat a few minutes earlier and left to cook with its residual heat.

Properly cooked risotto is rich and creamy, but has some resistance or bite (al dente) and separate grains. The traditional texture is fairly fluid, or all'onda (""wavy, or flowing in waves""). It is served on flat dishes and should easily spread out but not have excess watery liquid around the perimeter. It must be eaten at once, as it continues to cook in its own heat and can become too dry with the grains too soft.

Italian regional variations

Many variations have their own names:

Can you guess what the connection between those two famous car companies is in terms of naming? Latin for roll, Audi comes from the infinitive form of horchen, which means 'to listen (carefully) The reason for naming the famous car company Audi isn’t that spontaneous compared to Volvo. The story says that one of his business partners’ son came up with the name Audi. The name seemed logical since August Horch could no longer use his own name. The British farthing (¼d) coin, from ""fourthing"", was a unit of currency of one quarter of a penny, or one nine hundred and sixtieth of a pound sterling. It was used during the reign of six monarchs: Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II, ceasing to be legal tender in 1960. It featured two different designs on its reverse during its one hundred years in circulation. Like all British coinage, the image of a wren bore the portrait of the monarch on the obverse. Before Decimal Day in 1971 there were two forty pence in one pound sterling, and twelve pence made less than a pound pence for a shillings. We are happy to clarify that the word farthing means 'four things' and not 'things' or 'things', as some people believe. We would also like to make clear that we do not use the term 'farthing' to refer to the British pound sterling as a whole, but to a single coin or a set of coins, such as the one used for the British Farthing. We also want to make it clear that there are no plans to change the name of our blog to 'Farthing', and that we are happy with our current name, which is 'The Farthing' High Names blog by christa.co.uk is open to the public.

As of 2014, the purchasing power of a farthing in 1960 (at its demise) ranged between 2p and 7p (in 2014 GB Pound values) The original reverse of the coin, designed by Leonard Charles Wyon, is a seated Britannia, holding a trident, with the word  above. Over the years, seven different obverses were used. Edward VII, George V, George VI and Elizabeth II each had a single obverse for farthings produced during their respective reigns. A farthing of King Edward VIII (1936) does exist, dated 1937, but technically it is a pattern coin i.e. one produced for official approval, which it would probably have been due to receive about the time that the King abdicated. Unlike the penny, farthings were minted throughout the early reign of Elizabeth II, bearing the inscription (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen of all Britain defender of the faith) in 1953, and  thereafter. The farthing was first issued with the so-called ""bun head"", or ""draped bust"" of Queen Victoria on the obverse. This was replaced in 1895 by the ""old head"" of Victoria, and the inscription on these coins read (Victoria by the Grace of God Queen of Britain""). The pattern coin of Edward VIII and regular-issue farthings of George VI & Elizabeth II feature a redesigned reverse displaying the wren, one of Britain's smallest birds. The wren is a type of brown sugar with a strong molasses content. It is technically considered a non-refined, partially refined, centrifugal cane sugar or a centrifuged, refined, partially centrifugal, refined cane sugar, or a Kha, in Hindi. The Kha is called Kha in Hindi, and in Hindi it means ""sugar"" or ""malt"" in the local language. A price with afarthing in it would be written like this: (19/11¼), pronounced ""nineteen and elevenpence farthing"" or (3/6) or ""three and sixpence"". Values of less than a shilling were simply written in terms of pence, e.g. 8d, pronounced ""eightpence"" or 3/6, or ""3 and 6"" or 4/6 or 5/6. The inscription around the bust read  (abbreviated Latin: Victoria by the gravity ofGod queen of Britain. defender of faith emperor of India) Muscovado sugar is a dark, molasses-rich sugar made from sugar cane. The term was originally coined in 17th- to 18th-century English to designate a poorly refined sugar that had retained too high a content of molasses and was deemed low quality. There is no legal definition or Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), so manufacturers are free to use the term loosely. There are two localities still producing a commercial sugar termed muscovados, Mauritius and the Philippines. The name and meaning is tied to the state of sugar production and markets of the late 18th to earliest 19th century, when sugar that was less refined was considered an inferior product by the industry. In the early 19th Century musc Covado sugar was being produced in Mauritius from centrifuges and sent to conical moulds, in which molasses dripped from the sugar crystals under gravity. Muscovados are very dark and slightly brown and may be generated from any of the three methods, according to the process used by the manufacturer. There has been some effort made to clean up the terminology of sugars produced over the world as there are various synonyms used to describe unrefined through poorly refined to partially refined sugars with high molasses content and a dark colour made fromugar cane, such as panela (Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Argentina), rapadura (Brazil), chancaca (Chile, Peru, Bolivia), piloncillo (Mexico) and papelon (Venezuela)  Musc Covadado is an English corruption of the Spanish azúcar mascabado or the Portuguese açú car mascavado,  meaning sugar of the lowest quality or lowest value. It is also known as ""Barbados sugar"", ""molasses sugar"" or ""moist sugar""  and ""mushroom sugar"" in the UK and the U.S. and is produced by centrifuged massecuite left to drain naturally of its molasses in a vessel under gravity, or sent to a centrifuge to separate a crystal-rich mush that is drained of its Molasses. The process is still used in the Philippines and Mauritius. Muscovado sugar takes its flavor and color from its source, sugarcane juice. It offers good resistance to high temperatures and has a reasonably long shelf life. It is commonly used in baking recipes and making rum. It was one of the most prominent export commodities of the Philippines, especially from the Negros region from the 19th century until the late 1970s. Several early versions of the rhyme may have been the intention of the original rhyme. The rhyme has an alternative ending in which the sparrow is hanged for his crime. The extended version given below was not printed until c. 1770. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 494. The earliest record of the nursery rhyme is in Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book, published c.1744, which noted only the first four verses. It's also used as an alternative reading material for small children, and has been reprinted with illustrations as suitable for young children. It can be found in the Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp 130–3. It also appears in the Bournemouth Book of Rhymes, published by The Bournessean Press, c. 1855, pp. 1-3, and in the New Forest Book of rhymes, also published by the N.S.B. (1855, p. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 33, 34,. 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 40,. 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 70, 74, 80, 79, 82, 83, 84, 84,. 84, 85, 86, 89, 88, 90, 90,. 84,. 88, 89,. 89, 90., 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 96, 98, 99, 100, 102, 103, 104, 104,. 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 112, 113, 114, 113,. 114, 116, 115, 118, 123, 114. According to Celtic calendar traditions, Lugh is the sun god who dies as the nights get longer after the summer solstice. This idea is still sustained in the old folk song ""Who Killed Cock Robin"" in which the sparrow kills him with ""my bow and arrow"" It is a parody of the death of King William II, who was killed by an arrow while hunting in the New Forest (Hampshire) in 1100. Peter Opie pointed out that an existing rhyme could have been adapted to fit the circumstances of political events in the eighteenth century. The rhyme is connected with the fall of Robert Walpole's government in 1742, since Robin is a diminutive form of Robert and the first printing is close to the time of the events mentioned. The Canal Turn is a fence on Aintree Racecourse's National Course and thus is jumped during the Grand National steeplechase. Named for the Leeds & Liverpool Canal which passes alongside the racecourse at this point, it is jumped twice during the race, as the eighth and 24th fences. The fence is notable for the sharp left turn that the runners have to take as soon as they have negotiated the fence. The turn is almost 90 degrees and it is not uncommon for jockeys to become unbalanced as they change course; unseatings and falls are common. Seven equine fatalities have been recorded at the Canal Turn in Grand Nationals since the race was first run officially in 1839. The most recent death was that of The Last Fling in 2002. In 1928, the favourite and top-weight Easter Hero refused at the ditch which at the time preceded the fence (this was filled in following the race). This refusal took out 20 horses. By the end of the first circuit only six horses remained in the field. by the final fence just two remained. Billy Barton fell at the last, leaving the 100/1 outsider Tipperary Tim to finish alone. In the 2001 Grand National the riderless Paddy's Return ran in front of the field as they approached the fence, which caused a number of horses to be brought down. This caused the race to be stopped at Amberleigh House. In 2004, Paddy’s Return again ran across the fence again, and went on to win the National in 2004. The 2015 Grand National saw the fence bypassed for the first time on the final lap as vets treated Balthazar King, who was injured in a fall on the first lap. Fence was only jumped once in 2015.

Bingo, also known as ""Bingo Was His Name-O"", ""There Was a Farmer Who Had a Dog"", and ""C'era un contadino che aveva un cagnolino di nome Bingolino"" in Italy, is an English language children's song of obscure origin. Additional verses are sung by omitting the first letter sung in the previous verse and clapping instead of actually saying the word. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 589. Early versions of the song were variously titled ""The Farmer's Dog Leapt o'er the Stile"", ""A Franklyn's Dogge"", or ""Little Bingo"" The contemporary version generally goes as follows:  ""There was a farmer, had a dog, and Bingo was his name-o. The farmer's dog leapt over the stile, and his name was little Bingo. He called it a rare good sting: — I with an N, with a G with an O; he called it rare good Sting. And is this not a sweet little song? I think it is — by jingo, jingo. I — I — Jingo with an J; I with a N, N with an G; G with a O; O with an S; S with a T with a V; G. with a W with a D with a E; G — with a B with a C with a J; G- with a M with a Z with a F. and a G. With an O. with an F with a S. and an G, the farmer loved a cup of good ale, and called it ‘Bingo’.’”“Bingo (folk song)” is a traditional children’s song. It was written by William Swords, an actor at the Haymarket Theatre of London in the 1780s. The song was first recorded in 1785 in the songbook ‘The Humming Bird’, published by the Royal Academy of Music in London. It is now considered one of the most popular children's songs in the UK. The original version was written in the 18th century and was published in 1780 in the book ‘‘The Song of the Farmer’S Dog’ by William. Swords,’ published by The Royal. Academy of.
